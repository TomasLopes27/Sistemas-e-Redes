MQBuO2yWsFQ,Saya Gray: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | March 5, 2025
Of the 30 million people who have watched Daniel Caesar's Tiny Desk from 2018, plenty of them raved about the band, specifically the bass player. Little did we know that the young, unassuming musician named Saya Gray would be playing at the Desk seven years later, this time front and center.

Gray's pop songs are experimental in nature, so I was eager to hear how her music would cozy up to our space. That inclination to stretch out and try anything comes from her musical family: Her mother, who moved from Japan to Canada, founded Toronto's Discover Through the Arts music school and her dad, a jazz trumpeter, studied at the Berklee College of Music.

Gray leans into the challenge of the Tiny Desk and strips elements away. Like magic, she gives us these light and soulful interpretations of songs from SAYA, plus a throwback to ""IF THERE'S NO SEAT IN THE SKY (WILL YOU FORGIVE ME???)"" from her 2022 debut 19 MASTERS.

SET LIST
""SHELL ( OF A MAN )""
""..THUS IS WHY (I DON'T SPRING 4 LOVE)""
""IF THERE'S NO SEAT IN THE SKY (WILL YOU FORGIVE ME???)""
""LIE DOWN..""

GhY31ngpnWg,Abel Selaocoe: Tiny Desk Concert,"Tom Huizenga | March 3, 2025
Abel Selaocoe arrived early for his Tiny Desk performance so he could pop into a studio to talk with NPR’s Morning Edition. That’s where the versatile South African cellist and vocalist told the touching story of how he first got the hang of his instrument. Unable to afford a real cello, Selaocoe drew the strings of the instrument on paper, then pasted it to his chest to practice the fingerings.

These days, he tours the world offering his singular synthesis of global, jazz and classical sounds, always remembering his roots, even when collaborating with the likes of Yo-Yo Ma.

Selaocoe’s adroit bowing and percussive fingering gives the cello a vast color palette, with sounds of flutes and drums. His vocalizing, mostly in the Sesotho language, includes a kind of gravelly throat singing in which two or more pitches are produced, heard in the opening song which he dedicates to mothers and strong women who “[hold] the knife on the sharp side.”

French baroque meets contemporary South Africa in “Les Voix Humaines/Tsohle Tsohle,” where Selaocoe braids music by Marin Marais around tender singing. And he closes with an improvisation, noting that he prefers “people who don’t write the script and re-read it again.” The tune begins in a flurry of bowed arpeggios, like white caps on the lake, and evolves into plucked strings with metal clips attached, reminiscent of thumb pianos.

Selaocoe has indeed written his own distinctive “script.” In classical music, there are those who follow age-old traditions — and that’s just fine. But then there are those, like Selaocoe, who create brand-new traditions.

wVbZzgybaJ4,Marvin Sapp: Tiny Desk Concert,"Ashley Pointer | February 28, 2025
The morning that Bishop Marvin Sapp came to NPR, he told me that it was his kids who really emphasized how important it was for him to accept our invitation to perform: ""They told me, 'Dad, Tiny Desk is for the culture.' ""

Backed by a four-piece band and a six-piece choir, Sapp transforms our office into a sanctuary, performing an 11-song medley of praise and worship hits that span more than three decades in music and ministry. From the moment his set begins, the spirit moves through the room, filling every corner with raw emotion, joy and reverence.

From Sapp's early days with the trailblazing '90s gospel group Commissioned to penning anthems like ""Never Would Have Made It"" — a song that transcends church walls — his impact is woven into the fabric of Black culture. ""What's funny is, I saw some of y'all singing these songs, and y'all weren't even born when I recorded them,"" Sapp jokes, underscoring his intergenerational influence. Yet, despite his legendary status, Sapp took time after the performance to speak and pray with members of our audience, choosing ministry first, above all else.

5X4z95Fqvf4,Igmar Thomas' Revive Big Band: Tiny Desk Concert,"Nikki Birch | February 26, 2025
Right from the jump, the horns hit with crisp urgency, heralding the arrival of Igmar Thomas' Revive Big Band at the Tiny Desk. This is not your grandparents' — or even your great-grandparents' — big band sound. Yes, it feels familiar, but the driving grooves are undeniably hip-hop.

Thomas, whose many hats include trumpeter, composer and musical director, is a founding member of Revive Music Group. The brainchild of the late Meghan Stabile, Revive has created platforms and opportunities, including the big band, for up-and-coming musicians to shine and reshape the landscape of jazz.

In this set, Thomas welcomes fellow founding member Raydar Ellis, associate professor at the Berklee College of Music, to join. Originally produced by Ellis, ""TO KINDA LOUNGE AROUND"" inspired Thomas to turn the track into his first big band composition. Though he conducts the majority of this set, Thomas also plays a fiery trumpet solo here. Both Ellis and Thomas shout out ""fallen soldiers"" of the Revive Music Group, including Stabile and the late saxophonists James Casey and Casey Benjamin.

Performing this Tiny Desk concert required Thomas to rearrange all of the tunes for a smaller big band. He does so successfully. Everything stays true to the sonic integrity of his original compositions and the legacy of big band jazz.

jNnsTNZR2bU,Leon Thomas: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | February 20, 2025
On the morning of Leon Thomas' Tiny Desk concert, many NPR staffers assumed the show was postponed due to a snowstorm in the D.C. area. Not only did he proactively schedule his coast-to-coast flight but he was also 30 minutes early to the office. With his sophomore album, MUTT, Thomas has planted his flag as the most exciting artist in R&B music today. The Tiny Desk had to happen now; nothing would get in the way of divine timing.

Thomas was destined to be an entertainer — he's been doing it for most of his life. His parents were both musicians and introduced him to their world early on. As an actor, he appeared in multiple Broadway plays before becoming a staple on the Nickelodeon network. Under the tutelage of Babyface, he earned his chops as a writer and producer, eventually penning and producing big hits in R&B and hip-hop.

He opens this set with three songs from MUTT and closes with two from 2023's Electric Dusk, including ""Breaking Point,"" which he dedicates to his recently deceased grandfather, the opera singer John Anthony: ""This is one of his favorite songs.""

Artists who play the Tiny Desk aren't always sure what they're getting into. ""I wasn't expecting it to be in a big building,"" girl in red's Marie Ulven tells the NPR crowd. ""I thought I was going to go into a little house or something.""

Any confusion aside, Ulven and her band deliver a set suitable for the kind of cozy space she imagined, one of genuine charm, good humor and unbridled joy — a vibe that girl in red has always cultivated through music. She can find cause for celebration even in life's bleakest moments, like when Ulven and the band deploy rapid-fire handclaps during a song about the emptiness of unrequited love (""Phantom Pain"") or the way she says ""Depression!"" with a smile and a cheerleader's fist in the air just before ""Summer Depression."" ""It's a normal thing to feel like this,"" she sings, offering a much-needed dose of warmth and empathy on what was an otherwise chilly, overcast day in Washington, D.C.

E6-z-Gqd30Q,Yasmin Williams: Tiny Desk Concert,"Lars Gotrich | February 7, 2025
Yasmin Williams is a fingerstyle guitarist who taps, slaps and slides up and down the fretboard of her instrument with a commanding sense of scenery that flickers between the strings. Storytellers build worlds; at the Tiny Desk, Williams invites us into hers.

Each song in this performance is a chapter that introduces the characters in and around her music. ""Hummingbird"" features the clawhammer banjo of Allison de Groot and fiddle of Tatiana Hargreaves — they're fixtures in the old-time music scene who help to bring this rapturous romp to life. (And, aside from recording ""Hummingbird"" for Acadia, this is only the second time that the trio has performed the composition together.) The majestic ""Sisters"" invites strings, djembe and a 10-foot marimba behind the Desk to paint a picture of a beautiful Oregon town that, in Williams' estimation, needs some scenic overlooks.

We love a story that comes full circle. In 2018, we were mesmerized by Williams' Tiny Desk Contest entry, in which she performed ""Guitka"" with a kalimba taped to her guitar and tap shoes on her feet. She reprises the song here, with the help of djembe player Amadou Kouyate. ""It's fun to do everything at the same time!"" she tells the crowd, which includes family and friends from her Northern Virginia home. (Her mom beamed telling me about the time Williams won an NYU talent show as a college freshman.) When Williams closes with an early track, ""Restless Heart,"" we're taken back to the beginning: A kid who'd whoop her brothers at Guitar Hero, fell in love with the instrument itself, but never lost her sense of play.

vdph2l0iw74,Roberto Fonseca: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | February 5, 2025
In Cuba, pianists explore the wonderful rhythms of the island with their own percussive sense of melody. From the very first song in Roberto Fonseca’s Tiny Desk, we’re reminded of the Afro-Cuban jazz tradition’s long history: Not only do we get a driving foundation but also the kinds of horn lines that have sounded since the 1940s when Afro-Cuban rhythms and jazz improvisation bumped into each other.

The best always make it look easy. These band members, in particular, look like they could do this in their sleep. But there is a slight shift in the musical personality of this performance when the band strips down to a quartet: Fonseca's mastery of the instrument fuels the fiery finale.

l7OtKIZE7tE,Braxton Cook: Tiny Desk Concert,"Ashley Pointer | February 3, 2025
When Braxton Cook stepped into our space, he radiated a palpable sense of gratitude. As a Tiny Desk all-star, he's no stranger to our little corner: He's played alongside Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah, Tom Misch, Phony Ppl and Amaarae, plus gave his own Tiny Desk (home) concert in 2020. But here he takes center stage with his own band, performs his own compositions and transforms the Tiny Desk into a playground.

The Prince George's County-bred musician opens the set with ""MB (for Ma'Khia Bryant),"" a soul stirring and dynamic tribute to the Black teenager who was shot and killed by a police officer. Cook and guitarist Lucas Kadish lock in on the melody, while Jonathan Pinson's powerful drum groove propels the song forward. Pulling from his latest project, My Everything, Cook switches to acoustic guitar and flute for the title track, serving up some smooth vocals. On ""Zodiac,"" a composition inspired by jazz pianist Mary Lou Williams, Mathis Picard commands the keys in a flurry of a solo.

Cook closes with the currently unreleased ""We've Come So Far"" and it feels like a triumph. ""[This song] is about taking stock of how far we've come in life, and being grateful and finding gratitude everyday,"" Cook shares. With this performance, he embodies that very sentiment: Cook turns his journey into a celebration of growth, artistry and appreciation.

If you want it, Faye Webster’s Tiny Desk can offer an escape. Featuring her longtime band and a string quartet, Webster guides us through a swooning and sweeping set culled from her quickly growing catalog. 

Webster’s Underdressed at the Symphony was inspired by just that: Buying last-minute tickets to the symphony orchestra in her hometown of Atlanta and finding the experience otherworldly. She performs “But Not Kiss” and the title track from that album. Webster is a gentle but captivating performer in this space, at times grooving with her locked-in band. But she also appears to be in a trance of her own, like on the Atlanta Millionaires Club cuts “Jonny” and its spoken-word reprise. The horns heard on those original recordings gave everything a brassy warmth, but here Trey Pollard’s string arrangements enhance this Tiny Desk’s dream-like quality.

gAY74NyLMGs,MJ Lenderman: Tiny Desk Concert,"Elle Mannion | January 29, 2025
MJ Lenderman's music is a little sad, sometimes funny and almost always comforting. He's already played the Tiny Desk with the indie rock band Wednesday, but after a stellar 2024 — a memorable feature on Waxahatchee's ""Right Back To It"" and his own solo album, Manning Fireworks — it was time to bring him in for his own set.

His band, normally called MJ Lenderman and The Wind, told us that when they play their songs stripped back like this, they refer to themselves as MJ Lenderman and The Breeze. The fiddle-forward ""Rip Torn"" and ""You Don't Know The Shape I'm In"" feel especially suitable for the space.

Lenderman's compelling lyricism and wry sense of self shines in this performance. On a song pulled from Ghost of Your Guitar Solo, he reflects on how he used to think he wanted to be a Catholic priest: ""I would never have to worry / About the girls tryin' to break my heart / All expenses paid / Yeah, I'd have it made / The house would come furnished."" Afterward, he muses, ""Nothing funny has ever happened to me.""

The world of Portuguese fado is full of emotion that is on display within seconds of this performance by vocalist Carminho.

She came to her extraordinary talents by way of hard work, intuition and genetics, since her mom, the singer Teresa Siqueira, is considered one of the giants of her generation.

As she explains, some of the songs from this performance come from the EP Carminho at Electrical Audio, a recording she did with renowned American music engineer Steve Albini, who passed away last year before they could celebrate the success of their collaboration.

The performance is a front-row seat to the joys and sorrows of the fado spirit, delivered by an artist that uses the genre as a base to explore other musical worlds, always coming back to a tradition that is centuries old.

pePbXflDyRM,Bilal: Tiny Desk Concert,"Nikki Birch | January 21, 2025
Glance over the shoulder of the two decades since Bilal dropped his debut album, 1st Born Second, and you’ll see a career characterized by experimentation and exploration. Bilal’s fans have clamored to see him headline a Tiny Desk of his own, especially since he logged stellar performances alongside The Roots and at the White House with Common. He doesn’t disappoint here, proving the wait worthwhile when he begins with “Something To Hold,” a song that still hasn’t seen an official studio release. 

Vocally, Bilal is untethered — there’s nothing he can’t do. The jazz, soul, R&B and hip-hop communities recognize his genius; he’s been a favorite collaborator of musicians, vocalists and producers for years. 

Bilal’s mastery doesn’t end with his voice. For “Tell Me,” his performance accentuates the poetry of his lyricism. That’s what makes him exceptional: You’ll never see him perform any song the same way twice. Bilal’s set list is a calculated balance of the old and the new, and fans who have been riding with him since the beginning will be thrilled to hear what he does with “Soul Sista,” which closes out his set. Add to that the support of an insanely talented band and background vocalists and you have the blueprint for a live experience that’s perfectly suited for the Tiny Desk. 

SET LIST
“Something To Hold”
“Tell Me”
“When Will U Call”
“Lay Around”
“Soul Sista”

uJ3Pusp6R_s,The Red Clay Strays: Tiny Desk Concert,"Ann Powers | January 17, 2025
The Red Clay Strays is a big band with a future that keeps expanding. In the past few years the Mobile, Ala.-born five-piece has rocketed from club gigs to major stages like Colorado's Red Rocks and Nashville's Ryman Auditorium on the strength of its joyful interplay and soaring Southern rock sound. It wasn't a given that the Strays could rein in the grandeur that its fanbase relishes to fit the modest Tiny Desk. But this easy rolling set shows what's made these longtime road dogs one of the fastest-rising ensembles in any genre right now: the ability to blend intimate and epic moments in a seamless and perfectly modulated performance.

Singer Brandon Coleman possesses serious magnetism and a unique, keening voice — looking eerily like Boyd Holbrook as Johnny Cash in the Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown, he shared stories of self-doubt and solace in a higher power while introducing favorites like ""I'm Still Fine."" But the Strays are a band, not just a set piece for a handsome frontman, and the interplay on chooglers like ""Ramblin'"" or ballads like ""Wanna Be Loved"" will have viewers returning to this set. It's just so fun to watch keyboardist Sevans Henderson trade riffs with bottleneck guitarist Zach Rishel, or track how drummer John Hall adjusts his mighty power to the Desk's confines. And the Strays keep things inventive, always. ""Changed that one up completely — it was scary,"" guitarist and songwriter Drew Nix laughed after the band's swinging new take on its hit ballad ""Wanna Be Loved."" No need for fear — the Red Clay Strays continue to prove they're up to any challenge.

KY-27OC0B_0,From The Top: Tiny Desk Concert,"Tom Huizenga | January 15, 2025
There is no greater day each year at the Tiny Desk, for this music nerd, than when we host young musicians from the organization called From the Top. Through its 25 years of radio broadcasts, digital content and fellowships, FTT is a robust platform that showcases and supports young musicians around the country. And the three teenaged artists they’ve gathered here will renew your faith in the future of music.

Thirteen-year-old Cameron Renshaw, from Byron Center, Mich., is a born entertainer. “I really pour my heart out whenever I play,” he told Ellen DeGeneres when he appeared on her program at age 9. He was so exuberant he probably could have hosted the show himself. For us he plays a tricky piece on a single string of his cello by the 19th century violin hotshot Nicolò Paganini. The calm smiles on Renshaw’s face belie the difficulty of the music as he fingers wispy harmonics and leans into serious shredding.    
  
Violinist Laura Jin, a 12-year-old wunderkind attending the pre-college program at Juilliard, might be soft spoken, even shy, but she thrives on danger. Which is why she’s playing Wieniawski’s flamboyant Polonaise Op. 4. “I really enjoy this piece because it has many technical difficulties,” she explains before launching into a thicket of double stops, pizzicato and harmonics, offering a sterling tone and preserving the splendor and swagger of the piece.

Rhyuhn Green, a sartorially resplendent 18-year-old from Philadelphia, lives a double life as both an extraordinary pianist and a composer fielding commissions. He’ll release his debut album this month. He wrote the Impromptu “Symbiosis” at age 9 and it has evolved ever since, with its wealth of hummable tunes, romantic flourishes a la Chopin and a billowing, passionate crescendo.

In the end, our Tiny Desk crew — along with an audience of doting parents and From the Top staffers — all knew that something important and kind of miraculous had taken place. Together, we created a document for the world to witness the powerful message of great music made by the next generation of very fine musicians. 

SET LIST
Nicolò Paganini: Variations on One String on a theme by Rossini (excerpt)
Henryk Wieniawski: Polonaise de Concert, Op. 4
Rhyuhn Green: Impromptu in F minor “Symbiosis”

Y1f0WK9lsb0,Machel Montano: Tiny Desk Concert,"Nikki Birch | January 13, 2025
The first law of soca music, according to Machel Montano, is: ""it's dancing time all the time."" And in his Tiny Desk Concert, the ""King of Soca"" provides irrefutable evidence to support that statement.

Montano's performance is the first to bring soca, the high energy dance music of the Caribbean, to the Tiny Desk. The genre was born in Trinidad and Tobago in the early 1970s when calypso artist Lord Shorty (who later chose the name Ras Shorty I) added traditional Indian percussion instruments and rhythms to calypso music — itself a fusion that incorporates elements of African, Venezuelan, French and American music.

A proud Trinidadian, Montano's contribution to soca has earned him awards and recognition since his youth. His career began in earnest when he was 7 years old, and by the time he was 10, he'd shared the stage with Calypsonian pioneers and icons, most notably performing at Madison Square Garden with Mighty Sparrow, Lord Kitchener and The Mighty Shadow.

Indeed, Montano's Tiny Desk Concert was representative of his 40-plus-year career and, to the delight of those in attendance, included some of his biggest hits: ""One More Time,"" ""Famalay,"" ""Like Ah Boss"" and ""Soca Kingdom.""

Guests who attended Montano's performance came ready to fête! They jumped, they wined and they waved the flags of their respective Caribbean islands up high, singing along word for word. Being a Barbados-born, Saint Lucian-bred gyal, seeing and feeling the spirit of unity inherent to the cultural sound ingrained in my DNA — and foundational to my upbringing — represented at Tiny Desk made me beam with pride. If this is your first exposure to soca music, I suggest you stretch and loosen up your waistline before pushing play on this one, because there is no sitting still when soca fills the room.

QFGWCRXkWns,Isata Kanneh-Mason: Tiny Desk Concert,"Tom Huizenga | January 7, 2025
When it comes to musical dynasties, the Bach family is tough to beat, although today’s Kanneh-Mason clan is formidable. The Bachs included some 75 active musicians over a 200-year span, including superstar Johann Sebastian. The Kanneh-Mason household, from England, is just getting started, but boasts seven siblings, each classically trained, with a few having launched major careers, including the eldest, Isata, who brings three of her favorite pieces to our trusty Tiny Desk upright piano.

In her early years, Kanneh-Mason, like many budding pianists, practiced the easier works by Chopin. And, like visiting an old friend, she keeps returning to the so-called poet of the piano, but in this performance she plays the difficult and rambunctious finale to Chopin’s Third Piano Sonata. With cascades of chords, rippling arpeggios and romantic sweep, just getting to all of the notes is a major feat.

As a second course, Kanneh-Mason offers contrasting music by Franz Liszt, the ne plus ultra of Romantic era piano virtuosos, whose serene side gets the spotlight in the Consolation No. 3 — dressed in diaphanous curlicues and lacy ornamentation.  

Kanneh-Mason closes with an arrangement of “Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child” by Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, a Black British composer who died young in 1912. Coleridge-Taylor holds a special place in the heart of Kanneh-Mason and her family because his father hailed from Sierra Leone, the birthplace of Kanneh-Mason’s mother.

“Growing up, I never really saw any Black composers within the classical music field,” Kanneh-Mason explains. Now, with her career rising, she’s extending their legacy.


SET LIST
Frédéric Chopin: Piano Sonata No. 3 in B minor - IV. Finale   
Franz Liszt: Consolation No. 3 in D-flat major
Traditional (arr. Samuel Coleridge-Taylor): “Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child”

BEoGvTlJMyY,Sabrina Carpenter: Tiny Desk Concert,"Ashley Pointer | December 20, 2024
When I greeted Sabrina Carpenter at NPR HQ for her Tiny Desk debut, her charm was immediately disarming. Bubbling with excitement, she extended her hand, introduced herself and complimented my outfit with genuine warmth. You’d think this was one of her first “big time” gigs, not a regular performance for a pop veteran, having sold out arenas across the country touring her now six time Grammy-nominated sixth album, Short n’ Sweet. That humility made me love her even more. 

But Carpenter delivers far more than just charm in this performance. Backed by her band, complimented with pedal steel and a string quartet, she reimagines her biggest hits from Short n’ Sweet, while sharing the stories in between songs of how these tracks came to life. Opening with “Taste,” strings serve up some playful pizzicato, before Carpenter and her band move into a lush, soulful version “Bed Chem.” Then everyone swaps their electric instruments for acoustic to perform “Please Please Please” and “Slim Pickins.” Finally, Carpenter closes with the viral favorite “Juno,” cheekily asking the audience, “Have you ever tried this one?” before sweeping her rear end across the windchimes, earning a laugh from the room. 

“When I first started [writing songs] it was kinda in a room like this — a room with very dry walls and there’s no reverb,” Carpenter reflects at the top of her performance. “But there’s something so real and special.” That authenticity set the tone for a memorable session with one of 2024’s biggest breakout superstars.

cHkS0uOfx9k,Yo Gabba GabbaLand!: Tiny Desk Concert,"Alanté Serene | December 18, 2024
We've never had a performance quite like this before. Sesame Street put on a puppetted concert for the kids, while GWAR was our first visit from gigantic monsters. But here a colorful crew transforms the Tiny Desk into Yo Gabba GabbaLand! with all five of the Gabba friends in their full form, led by the spirited Kammy Kam and backed by a five-piece band.

I brought Yo Gabba GabbaLand! to the Tiny Desk because my 3-year-old niece is a fan of the show … but, let's be real, so am I. Its predecessor, Yo Gabba Gabba!, grabbed my attention in 2007 — even as a middle-schooler who was too ""cool"" for kid content — with its funky, hip-hop influenced music. The reimagined show introduces new characters and ideas while maintaining the same groovy sounds that make you wanna dance, no matter your age.

The fun-filled set features Yo Gabba Gabba! classics like ""Party in My Tummy"" and new cuts such as ""The Orange Cat's Special Time Outdoors,"" which includes a surprise visit from Thundercat — donning an orange cat suit, of course. This one is sure to please the little ones and your inner child.

ps1f7p720FA,Waxahatchee: Tiny Desk Concert,"Elle Mannion | December 16, 2024
The last time Waxahatchee performed at the Tiny Desk, things looked — and sounded — a bit different. In 2013, Katie Crutchfield, sporting baby bangs, performed her bare-boned, devastating songs alone with her eyes mostly closed. ""I rolled out of the tour band … I sort of didn't really know what I was doing at all. My amp broke in the middle [of the set],"" Crutchfield says of her 2013 performance.

And while she was already earning her place as one of the most profound lyricists of the 21st century, much has changed since then for the now Grammy-nominated artist. Across Crutchfield's six albums as Waxahatchee, plus country duo Plains, she's strayed from her DIY punk roots and settled into something more akin to Americana.

In this Tiny Desk concert, Crutchfield is cool and cozy behind the Desk; she sways with an easy smile as she kicks off the set with her latest single, ""Much Ado About Nothing,"" alongside a five-piece band. She performs one of NPR Music's best songs of 2024, ""Right Back To It,"" as well as Tigers Blood's title track and an album standout, ""Crowbar."" She and the band end with ""Fire,"" a song that, as the first single from 2020's Saint Cloud, marked the beginning of a beautiful transformation of Waxahatchee's music.

""I'm really happy that that exists,"" Crutchfield says of her 2013 Tiny Desk. ""And I'm really happy to be back to show you this new version of the band.""

fOAIrUZbOwo,Billie Eilish: Tiny Desk Concert,"Anamaria Sayre | December 12, 2024
Saudade is a Portuguese word that can be roughly defined as a feeling of melancholy, nostalgia or yearning for something that is beloved but not present. There's no perfect translation, but one of the closest English expressions of the word I've ever seen is Billie Eilish's Tiny Desk performance.

You'd think the Los Angeles-born singer invented the term. Every breath is so full of indulgent melancholy, hopeful regret, at 22 years old she's become a captivating fixture of what it means, or rather what it feels, to love and lose simultaneously.

Trading belting vocals and rocking guitar for gentle piano and almost-breaking falsetto, she reimagines tracks like ""THE GREATEST"" in their most raw and honest form. In Eilish's world, love's purest forms are inherently terrifying. Therein lies her starpower – she effortlessly, relentlessly brings to the fore the trickier emotions many of us tuck away for fear of what the world might think.

""I don't know what I'm crying for, I don't think I could love you more,"" she sings on ""BIRDS OF A FEATHER."" Turns out the world is made up of a lot of people who just want to be seen, and this stripped down set is the perfect space for Eilish to give listeners just that.

99raT9A1LW8,Stereophonic: Tiny Desk Concert,"Mitra I. Arthur | December 9, 2024
The process of artistic creation makes for perfect storytelling. There's the unsexy doubt and the exhilarating breakthroughs, the fortifying confirmations and the sticky pockets. It is a messy process. This whole creative affair gets stickier when the artist is a band full of complex personalities and fraught relationships.

This is the central premise of David Adjmi's play Stereophonic, which ends its Broadway run on Jan. 12. The play garnered a record 13 Tony nominations and took home five, including Best Play. So what is a play doing at the Tiny Desk? Well, the play features an album's worth of original music from Will Butler (formerly of Arcade Fire) whose lyrics provide insight into five people falling apart when they should be coming together creatively. The music is performed by the original Broadway cast members Will Brill (who won a Tony for his performance), Juliana Canfield, Tom Pecinka, Sarah Pidgeon and Chris Stack, who are joined here by composer Butler and music director and orchestrator Justin Craig.

The cast treats us to ""Bright (Fast)"" featuring Pidgeon's earthy twang, the Pecinka-led ""Seven Roads,"" and Canfield's contemplative duo of ""Drive,"" (supported by Stack and Brill's propulsive beat) and ""In Your Arms."" Throughout the performance Butler and Craig provide embellishments that help build out the sonic footprint of the tunes. Our unnamed band (as the audience never quite learns its actual name) closes the set with ""Masquerade"" in all its grooving '70s rock grandeur.

-91vymvIH0c,Doechii: Tiny Desk Concert,"Ashley Pointer | December 6, 2024
Doechii, known as the ""Swamp Princess,"" arrived at NPR HQ radiating confidence. She moved with purpose, knowing exactly what she wanted and how to achieve it. Her declarative statement, ""I'm everything,"" from ""BOOM BAP"" off her Grammy-nominated mixtape, ALLIGATOR BITES NEVER HEAL, was on full display in her Tiny Desk debut.

Backed by a full band, horns and two background singers, Doechii's performance was a masterclass in creativity. Sporting vintage academia looks, complete with matching cornrows and beads, Doechii delivers a freshly rearranged medley of cuts from ALLIGATOR BITES NEVER HEAL, tailored specifically for Tiny Desk. While hip-hop remained at the core, she truly gave us everything: a jazz arrangement of ""BOOM BAP,"" heavy rock vibes on ""CATFISH"" and a Southern praise break outro on ""NISSAN ALTIMA.""

She closed her set with ""Black Girl Memoir"" from her debut album, Oh The Places You'll Go. Before performing, she shared, ""I wrote this song specifically for Black women. As a dark-skinned woman, there's a very unique experience I'm trying to internalize … This is dedicated to all the beautiful Black women in the room."" While her star has been steadily on the rise since her debut, 2024 is shaping up to be the year Doechii cements herself as a household name.

Oxudnq20uRw,Old Crow Medicine Show: Tiny Desk Concert,"Lars Gotrich | December 4, 2024
If you're watching this, it's because you love a song — more than that, you love how someone plays that song. Several artists have covered ""Wagon Wheel,"" an inescapable staple of folk festivals and hootenannies. But you know what? No one performs that ramblin' folk stomper quite like Old Crow Medicine Show. So here, 20 years after the band recorded and turned it into a phenomenon, Ketch Secor and his band open their Tiny Desk with ""Wagon Wheel.""

For nearly three decades, Old Crow Medicine Show has served up a revved-up take on old-time music, folk, bluegrass, country and everything else tossed into what we call roots music. That energy, still wired from its early busking days, translates here as the band runs through ""O Cumberland River"" and ""Wolfman of the Ozarks,"" complete with train-chugging harmonica and a jaw harp duet. The group closes with ""One Drop,"" a hopeful, gospel-style call for unity in a moment we could all use some.

XyyzwrL4msk,Rosie Tucker: Tiny Desk Concert,"Elle Mannion | December 2, 2024
""It's very satisfying to sing a song about murderous paperclip technology in an office building,"" Rosie Tucker jokes after singing ""Paperclip Maximizer,"" a standout track from the Los Angeles indie rocker's fourth album, UTOPIA NOW! The song's title refers to a Swedish thought experiment that demonstrates the dangers of artificial intelligence. It's one of many references in Tucker's songs, which are full of big ideas, tender observations, sharp lyricism and catchy pop-punk melodies.

Tucker's clear voice kicks off their Tiny Desk set with the unforgettable line: ""I hope no one had to piss in a bottle at work to get me the thing I ordered on the internet."" And while their music often critiques the failures of capitalism and technology, Tucker is still hopeful for a brighter future. They dedicate the final song, the melancholy ""Ambrosia,"" to their 5-year-old neighbor and a friend's baby. ""I just want the world for these kids — and I want a better world than the one that we have.""

zi_jOYpeCEM,TV On The Radio: Tiny Desk Concert,"Robin Hilton | November 27, 2024
TV On The Radio was one of the first bands we tried to coax into playing in our office back in the earliest days of the Tiny Desk, but it never happened. Roughly 15 years later, the group finally arrived to play a breathtaking and career-spanning set.

""Thank you for having us,""' frontman Tunde Adebimpe told the crowd after opening with a blazing version of ""Wolf Like Me,"" from 2006's Return to Cookie Mountain. ""I don't know what happened 15 years ago. I think someone missed a phone call or an email 'cause we wanted to do it!"" ""We've been sitting around talking amongst ourselves saying, 'I don't know why they don't want us,' "" Kyp Malone added.

TV On The Radio is currently celebrating the 20th anniversary of Desperate Youth, Bloodthirsty Babes, and released a deluxe version of the album earlier this month. But they stuck to both older and newer releases for the Tiny Desk, including a slightly more subdued version of ""Could You,"" backed by Yusuke Yamamoto on vibraphone, from 2014's Seeds. They also performed ""Satellite,"" from the band's 2003 EP Young Liars, before closing with a soaring, lighters-up take on the title track.

iQTErSrzC64,Teedra Moses: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | November 25, 2024
To celebrate the 20th anniversary of her debut album, Complex Simplicity, Teedra Moses came draped in all red, the same color she wore on the album’s cover. She couldn’t wait to get into the office and sing. Admittedly, I held off from formally inviting her to play the Desk for a couple of years because I knew this landmark was approaching, and this album was worth honoring in a major way. She rarely performs songs from Complex… exclusively, so she brought family and invited special guests to participate, including long-time collaborator J. Black and Tiny Desk alumnus Durand Bernarr.

2004 was a banner year for R&B albums, with debuts from John Legend, Ciara, and Fantasia. We also got the final album from Destiny’s Child and Usher’s magnum opus, Confessions, among many others. Moses came at a time when love songs still reigned supreme and while she carried that tradition into Complex Simplicity, on the flip side, she also wrote about how she really felt, which makes this album so unique. The balance of hard, soft and slick was a refreshing formula. Moses’ brazen approach to songwriting influenced a generation of women in R&B, like SZA, Summer Walker, and Ari Lennox. Behind the Desk, she ran through the best of Complex Simplicity, closing with the original and Kaytranada remix of “Be Your Girl.”

SET LIST
“Caught Up”
“Complex Simplicity”
“You'll Never Find (a Better Woman)”
“You Better Tell Her”

88mdzNcOHj4,Wyatt Flores: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | November 22, 2024
Watching Wyatt Flores lead his band through their turn behind the Desk is like watching stardust coalesce into not just a celestial star, but an actual Americana and country star. 

With genuine smiles and even a nervous false start, Flores is engaging in both his personality and music. This performance is a reflection of his shift into a more joyous celebration of his small town Oklahoma roots following his well crafted songs meditating on loss.

I don’t know about you, but I find it very difficult — if not impossible — to not be captivated by his anthemic singalongs that feature a voice dripping with a twang that was made for storytelling.

wnFQn7GD1rg,The Magnetic Fields: Tiny Desk Concert,"Robin Hilton | November 20, 2024
There's a good chance you or someone you know has borrowed a line or two from 69 Love Songs, the beloved, three-volume album released by The Magnetic Fields in 1999. Lyrics from frontman Stephin Merritt's often comical and affecting opus to dating and romance have wound up in everything from film and TV shows to love letters and marriage vows. Now on tour for the album's 25th anniversary, the band stopped by the Desk to share more than a half-dozen songs from across the collection.

Battling a head cold, Merritt cradled a stuffed animal through the performance (a white cat you can spot sitting on the Desk in a lot of Tiny Desk sets). ""I don't actually know whose cat this is,"" he told the crowd, as he crooned multiple fan favorites, including ""The Book of Love,"" ""I Don't Want To Get Over You,"" and ""Come Back From San Francisco.""

The band, featuring the complete original lineup, performed without drums and an almost entirely acoustic set, with the exception of Sam Davol's electric cello.

SET LIST
""Roses""
""All My Little Words""

_Q8N8a7-Qwk,Durand Jones: Tiny Desk Concert,"Robin Hilton | November 15, 2024
You might not have known it, but this is the Tiny Desk you’ve been waiting for. Throughout his entire, window-rattling performance, Durand Jones sang fervently of hope, finding joy in sorrow and perseverance through struggle and doubt, with one of the most memorable voices we’ve had at the Desk.

Backed by a small but equally impressive group of gospel singers, including three members of The Harlem Gospel Travelers, Jones shimmied, glided and belted his way through four tracks from his debut solo release, Wait Til I Get Over. At one point, he told the crowd he’d read negative comments about the album on social media and wondered if it’d been a mistake to put out. “So I got on my knees and prayed to my ancestors. And I was like, ‘Yo, I feel like I’m doing the right thing here but let me know, I need some confirmation.’ ” The next day he heard NPR’s Mitra I. Arthur give an emotional review of the album’s title cut and knew he’d made the right choice. “I was like, ‘duly noted! I’m gonna keep going!’ ” 

Jones closed the set with a stirring, a capella version of “Wait Til I Get Over,” with thanks for the journey it started on and how it led him to the Desk.

IRQR5foSUSI,Yunchan Lim: Tiny Desk Concert,"Tom Huizenga | November 13, 2024
Remember what you were doing at the tender age of 18? Probably not taking home a gold medal from a major piano competition. Two years ago, when the South Korean pianist Yunchan Lim was only 18, he won the storied Van Cliburn International Piano Competition. Ever since, we’ve been asking him to play at our Tiny Desk. Lim was the youngest ever to win the Cliburn, and one of his performances there has been viewed more than 16 million times on Youtube.  
 
Simply put, Lim became an overnight sensation. And it’s easy to see why in these deeply considered performances. Even though he was under the weather -- explaining to our audience why his voice was weak -- you could never tell by his powerful command of every note, making our trusty upright sound like a 9-foot grand piano. 
 
Listen for the deliciously strummed chords in Liszt’s Petrarca Sonetto, where, near the end, he rings a bell of two notes high on the keyboard and leaves them suspended in midair. Lim is celebrated for his finger twisting virtuosity, but it’s this kind of poetic dynamic control that astonishes. 
  
Tchaikovsky is a personal favorite. Lim summons thunder in a stormy passage of the snack-sized Moment lyrique, and follows with “October” (from the cycle The Seasons) where he conjures shades of lambent autumn light, taking great care to dab and mix colors like a painter.
 
It’s easy to fall under the spell of Yunchan Lim’s playing. And we’re lucky, because at just age 20 Lim will be enchanting listeners for a long time.

SET LIST
Franz Liszt: Sonetto del Petrarca No. 104  
Piotr Tchaikovsky: Moment lyrique  
Piotr Tchaikovsky: “October” (from The Seasons)

mV5U5gWJSU4,Elmiene: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | November 11, 2024 
Elmiene has a natural light. His charisma, humor and self-awareness strikes first, but the knockout blow is that vintage voice. If I didn’t know better, I’d assume I’m listening to someone with years of Baptist church training and countless life experiences. Yet he’s a 23-year-old Muslim man, quick to say that he writes mostly from the perspectives of those around him. He’s a poet, born to perform, which is likely why he wasn’t really nervous but more so in awe of performing at the Tiny Desk — especially when he found out the toy glockenspiel he played was left by Dua Lipa.

The emotion the British singer-songwriter pulls from is linked to his fascination with ’90s R&B. Crooners like D’Angelo, Anthony Hamilton and Silk all have that knack for crying out for love. Since so much hip-hop is incorporated into today’s love songs, Elmiene’s adaptation provides a welcome balance. He’s yet to drop a full length LP, instead opting for an EP here and a single there, devoting himself to developing and learning who he is as an artist. Draped in a custom kaftan, Elmiene stepped behind the Desk to play highlights from his latest EP, Anyway I Can, and a couple from 2023’s Marking My Time.

w40XbPyotj8,LaRussell: Tiny Desk Concert,"Alanté Serene | November 8, 2024
A few years ago my dad mentioned an up-and-coming artist by the name of LaRussell. “No, seriously,” he said. “This dude is different! You gotta check him out.” So I gave him a listen and I’ve been a fan ever since.

Vallejo, Calif. native LaRussell has infiltrated the hip-hop industry in a way so many artists only dream of doing. Determined to stay “majorly independent,” the rapper built his own musical infrastructure right in his Bay Area home. LaRussell’s popular “Backyard Residency” concerts are quite literally held in his backyard, and the artist and his homies bring his backyard vibes to the Tiny Desk for what feels like a party with your most fun friends.

LaRussell makes sure to please both day one fans and new listeners with a jam-packed setlist that melds some of his best tracks together. He smiles and dances his way through a high-energy performance that solidifies his spot as one of the most memorable Tiny Desk Concerts I’ve attended thus far.

SET LIST
“Glory”/“Do That Lil Dance You Be Doing”
“GIVE ME A BEAT!”
“Caught Up in My Head”
“Hood Cry”/“Perfect”

q-ne87XKlY0,Koshi Inaba: Tiny Desk Japan,"Suraya Mohamed | November 4, 2024
Vocalist Koshi Inaba is well known as the vocalist and lyricist  for the massively popular Japanese rock duo B’z. But he’s also recorded several solo albums, including this year’s Tadamono, his first in 10 years. Back in September, he stopped by the Tiny Desk in Japan to perform some of his new music.
""I've performed live in many places up until now, but this was the first time I've performed live in an office with people working next to me,” Inaba said during the rehearsal for this show. “No matter how many years you've been doing it, there are always firsts!""
With special arrangements designed just for this performance, Inaba captures the Tiny Desk spirit in this session recorded live in Tokyo at the NHK (aka the Japan Broadcasting Corporation). Tiny Desk Japan is the latest addition to the global TV series version of the beloved Tiny Desk Concert series.

eHMv0tUe5eE,Sheer Mag: Tiny Desk Concert,"Lars Gotrich | November 1, 2024
At the Tiny Desk, we love to entertain unexpected requests from artists: American Football brought in a children’s choir; Tyler, the Creator’s team lit our “stage” for a nighttime performance. These can certainly make a performance stand out, but also extend the range of an artist’s creativity. So when Sheer Mag asked if we knew a bagpipe player in the D.C. area, we found Tim Carey, who also just so happened to have played the first-ever WrestleMania in 1985. If this bagpiper’s good enough for Roddy Piper, then he’s good enough for Sheer Mag.

Forged in punk and steeped in ‘70s hard rock, power-pop and disco, Sheer Mag has been a force for good in rock and roll for the past decade. The band doesn’t recreate or revive, but truly lives inside the blood, sweat and tears of this music — it’s fun and unpredictable, yet harmonious and homey. That’s why this Tiny Desk feels like a well-earned victory lap, featuring songs across the Philly band’s catalog, from its early 7-inch singles to its latest album, Playing Favorites. The riffs are timeless, the boogie is raucous, the guitar solos are sweaty and Tina Halladay’s voice is a soulful sneer that will set your heart aflame.

6Z1rdfucIUU,Chelsea Wolfe: Tiny Desk Concert,"Robin Hilton | October 30, 2024
Not long after her arrival, Chelsea Wolfe carefully arranged a handful of objects on the Desk in front of her — a dagger, a chalice, a pentacle and flower — all inspired by the Magician tarot card, which symbolizes new beginnings. But if there was a slight of hand performed during her set, it was the way she stripped down her often colossal sound to its barest, most intimate elements, revealing the profound beauty within.

“Whispers in the Echo Chamber,” a dark and distorted rumination on intrusive thoughts and the struggle to let go, for example, is more fragile here, with Wolfe’s breathtakingly beautiful voice front-and-center. While most of this Tiny Desk features material from She Reaches Out to She Reaches Out to She — and the upcoming Unbound EP, its acoustic companion — Wolfe closes with “Flatlands,” which originally appeared on the 2012 album Unknown Rooms.

This is Wolfe’s second appearance at the Tiny Desk. Her first was in 2016, following the release of Abyss.

57H4UBO6B5k,Sylo: Tiny Desk Concert,"Kara Frame | October 28, 2024
When I first heard Sylo, his voice spoke to me — something light and airy, but cozy. It was just him on a summery beat and an acoustic guitar; at the Tiny Desk, the sweetness of “Millions” blooms.

Before his first headlining tour, the Toronto-based R&B artist stopped by the NPR Music office to share material from his latest project, Dreamt that I Was, and three older songs reimagined for this performance. The choices reflect his growth as an artist: His new music still showcases his soft vocals, but holds more dimension with the addition of saxophone and piano.

As the band settled in, it was clear to see how important this moment was for each of them. Sylo acknowledged this at the end of the set: “This last song is a testament and a reminder to how far this journey as an artist has taken me. It’s had its ups and downs, but I honestly wouldn’t have it any other way because it led me to where I stand today.""

y38qQRg3UDI,Dua Lipa: Tiny Desk Concert,"Stephen Thompson | October 25, 2024
When Dua Lipa came to visit the Tiny Desk, she had nothing to prove — and much to live up to. After all, the singer’s Tiny Desk (home) concert, recorded in London in the aftermath of her 2020 blockbuster Future Nostalgia, still holds the record for the most-viewed Tiny Desk concert in history, her 130 million views surpassing even the likes of Mac Miller and Anderson .Paak. 

Four years later, the pop superstar finally graced the actual Tiny Desk, this time armed with four warm and inviting songs from Radical Optimism. Arriving in the first half of this year — when the dominant storylines in music so often revolved around grievances and rivalries — Radical Optimism stood out for its comparatively sunny and forgiving takes on failed and failing relationships, seduction, new love and old wounds. And, of course, it dispensed a world-beating banger in “Houdini,” which joins past Dua Lipa classics (“New Rules,” “Levitating,” “Don’t Start Now”) on her own personal Mount Rushmore.

Befitting an artist whose newest songs often reflect the pursuit of personal growth — see: “Happy for You” — Lipa and her team breezed through the NPR Music offices with a mix of low-drama professionalism and unmistakable warmth. We’ve dealt with a lot of stars (and their teams) over the years, and as often as people ask us to dish about people who’ve been difficult, we’ve mostly accumulated stories of people who’ve been lovely to have around. Even among all those, Lipa and her people stood out: They were kind, gracious, fun and game.

That shows up on camera, too, as you’ll see here. This is joyful music, at a time when we could all use it.

PbM82phaaeg,The Baylor Project: Tiny Desk Concert,"Mitra I. Arthur | October 23, 2024
When Marcus and Jean Baylor of The Baylor Project enter a space, their love for each other and playfulness is on display. Those traits carry over to the music they’ve been creating since becoming musical partners, in addition to life partners. Their journey to the Desk includes similar musical upbringings as children of pastors (evident in Marcus’ repeated call and response of “Let the church say what? Amen!”) and stints in music groups prior to forming The Baylor Project: Marcus as a drummer in jazz quartet Yellowjackets, and Jean in R&B duo Zhané. These threads are woven through their joint musical output that has garnered them seven Grammy nominations.

When reflecting on their visit to the Tiny Desk, the Baylors remarked that this is a “one-of-a-kind performance” that perfectly reflected their ethos “of love, family, faith, culture and community!” The kinetic energy of “We Swing (The Cypher)” allows Jean to display her skillful scatting as she trades bars with a stacked horn section featuring Keith Loftis, Freddie Hendrix and Mark Williams. We have to give the drummer some love, as Marcus gives us a stirring and impressive drum interlude. You can see the couple’s adorable, flirtatious dynamic in the joyful “Happy to Be With You,” as Marcus teases his wife to “sing about me!” causing her to laugh. In the mournful “2020,” bassist Ben Williams lays down an intro that is a harbinger of the shattering vortex the band creates, mimicking the uncertainty of the title year, all while laced with Jean’s prayers. Those prayers are answered in the set’s peaceful closer, “Only Believe,” as Terry Brewer’s piano provides a perfect soothing balm.

x8WTPgeVPjg,Kamasi Washington: Tiny Desk Concert,"Nikki Birch | October 21, 2024
Grammy-nominated saxophonist Kamasi Washington brought down the house at his Tiny Desk Concert. He played selections from three of his albums, showcasing his ability, with the support of his killer band, to go from high energy to reflective ballads while never losing danceability.

Washington has said, “The kind of music I make is not necessarily associated with dance, even though I feel like the more expression in the music, the more it can inspire you to move.” To drive that point home, Washington’s special guest was the legendary DJ Battlecat, one of the pioneers of the West Coast sound. The DJ is responsible for mixing in a little sample of the rapper Kendrick Lamar shouting out the saxophonist — “keep a horn on me / that Kamasi” — at the top of “Street Fighter Mas.”

Also accompanying Washington are his father, flutist and soprano saxophonist Rickey Washington, who you can often see looking at his son with pride. The other musicians behind the Desk are keys wizard Brandon Coleman, Tony Austin with the heartbeat, Miles Mosley holding down the low end, trombonist Ryan Porter and Patrice Quinn on vocals. There’s so much more that can be said about this Tiny Desk Concert, but sometimes, you just have to let the music speak for itself.

U0vBoAbZZy0,Audrey Nuna: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | October 18, 2024
After spending a few years listening to Audrey Nuna’s music and watching her music videos, I wondered how she would conform to the Tiny Desk. Her visuals embody larger-than-life personae, and the sonics of her debut album, A Liquid Breakfast, are anything but acoustic. Everything that comes with the New Jersey-born singer-songwriter is big. She stepped up to the challenge of stripping the elements in 2022 when she played a special Tiny Desk (home) concert, which was enough to hold her spot behind the Desk.


Audrey walked into NPR headquarters with her band, “The Jaywalkers,” baring that same persona that sets her apart from the rest, rockin' hunting vests, kilts with skull caps and a denim shirt made of denim pants. The setlist perfectly encapsulates how much musical ground she’s able to cover. She goes from a staccato flow on “Damn Right” to straight-up funk on “Time.” She flipped “Baby Blues” into a jazz number and played “Baby OG” from her new album, TRENCH, for the first time. Her long-time producer, Anwar Sawyer, handled keyboards and music direction, providing authenticity to this set. They’d put in weeks of rehearsal, and post-show, she told me that the execution was exactly what she envisioned.

PYcn36-k7lw,John Holiday: Tiny Desk Concert,"Tom Huizenga | October 15, 2024
Upon meeting countertenor John Holiday in the NPR lobby, I was immediately tasked with carrying his awesome spangly boots (he brought two pairs) up to our Tiny Desk space. Other arms, including his husband’s, were occupied with clothing and various necessities.

The boots reflect Holiday’s sparkling personality — a captivating blend of determination, wit and clear-eyed optimism. These qualities helped propel him into celebrity status, not only in the final rounds of NBC’s The Voice, where he was championed by John Legend, but also in opera houses the world over.

While Holiday has made a name for himself in classical music, he says his goal is to be a bridge between the many genres of music he sings. And in this set he gives us a pretty wide range, including an elegant, Bach-inflected French art song, a regal opera aria by Handel, a moving traditional spiritual and the devastating jazz song “Strange Fruit,” made famous by Billie Holiday. “It’s not a feel good song,” the countertenor warns, adding that it “represents so much in our country’s history that sometimes we like to skirt.”

The only way to follow a song of such darkness is with one of light and triumph. Holiday dedicates “Lift Every Voice and Sing” to young, Black voters, saying, “It’s really important that you let your voices be heard, even if you think nobody’s listening.”

And for fans of fabulous voices, it’s important that this voice be heard — the singular, silvery and expressive voice of John Holiday.    

SET LIST
Reynaldo Hahn: “À Chloris” 
Traditional (arr. Hall Johnson): “I’m Goin’ to Tell God All My Troubles”
George Frideric Handel: “Ombra mai fù” (from Xerxes)

Felix Contreras | October 11, 2024
Sheila E. is a portrait of motion.

Not just the movement of her body as one of the world’s most recognized drummers, but also as a versatile musician who glides easily from genre to genre with the ease of a master. For her time behind the Desk, she assembled a team of musicians to play tracks from her first ever salsa album Bailar.

From the first notes of “Rumba Percussion Jam,” Sheila E.’s bona-fides performing true rumbera (traditional Afro-Cuban drumming and singing) are on full display with her conga chops. The entire set is a reflection of her long standing ability to meld Afro-Caribbean, jazz and funk into a danceable celebration that caps off with shots of tequila for her final track “Playa Tequila.”

Any amount of time spent with Sheila E. is a reminder that high caliber musicianship is always first and goes down easier when presented with the joyous energy of an icon.

Anamaria Sayre | October 9, 2024
Fresh off the release of its latest album Submarine, The Marías have never felt more ready-made for the Tiny Desk. With the first few chimes of the synth and notes from Maria Zardoya’s breathy vocals, the band makes it clear that there’s no better place to bring its bedroom pop style than this slightly bigger space.

The indie band has been skyrocketing over the last few years with classic Spanglish hits like “Cariño” (featured here at the Desk) and a collab on Bad Bunny’s Un Verano Sin Ti. But there’s so much more to the group than the smooth electronic beats and guitar riffs that meet the ear.

Headed by Puerto Rican lead singer Maria Zardoya, who proudly places a Puerto Rican flag on the Desk halfway through the show, there is an authenticity to the group’s lyricism and presentation that pulses just beneath the emotive keys. The band’s performance feels like a soundtrack for a generation that exists in many worlds, and in The Marías Tiny Desk viewers find a new, ethereal, welcoming world to belong to.

s9xYNeiSofM,Eladio Carrión: Tiny Desk Concert,"This Sept. 15 to Oct. 15, NPR Music celebrates artists from all corners of Latinidad with an 'El Tiny' takeover.

Anamaria Sayre | October 7, 2024
English language hip-hop and Latin trap exist in two separate dimensions; Kansas-born, Puerto Rico-raised Eladio Carrión embodies both and neither at once. That’s perhaps a poetic reflection of a childhood spent as a military brat, moving from state to state, across the country that colonized his family’s island before settling back in Humacao. At the Tiny Desk, Carrión wasted no time putting that multicultural flow on full blast. 

He kicked things off with a victory lap on “Gladiador,” leading straight into a keys-heavy arrangement of “Air France” and then the delightful staccato of “Tata” off his 2021 album Monarca. As if “Where my lil mamas at today?” wasn’t a perfect enough line to warm up the crowd, he carried on with the bilingual bars of “Hey Lil Mama,” seamlessly transitioning into a glorious trap-rock rendition of his 2022 hit “Mbappe.” Carrión’s studio collaborators include some of the biggest names in rap and reggaeton, but his only guest at El Tiny, rising Spanish singer Lia Kali, brought a new level of magnetism to the performance, demonstrating how the uncategorizable Carrión can’t help but keep us on our toes with his every move.

9kqnsoY94L8,Ca7riel & Paco Amoroso: Tiny Desk Concert,"This Sept. 15 to Oct. 15, NPR Music celebrates artists from all corners of Latinidad with an 'El Tiny' takeover.

Anamaria Sayre | October 4, 2024
The Argentine power duo Ca7riel & Paco Amoroso breathe authenticity. They each came up in their own right in an urban scene buzzing with energy, ideas and true ingenuity.

Argentina is a country notorious for unabashed expression. The country has been rocked by some of the most notable music moments in Latin America, from the inception rock en español, to waves of extreme censorship on artistic expression. Contemporary artists take nothing for granted when it comes to showing up just as they are, and Ca7riel & Paco Amoroso are two of the most exciting artists doing so.

While heavily dependent on electronic sounds, they came to play at the Tiny Desk with an arrangement that whipped their typical beats into stirring drum taps and horn harmonies. Everything they touch turns to creative gold, spinning tracks with a unique silliness and magnetism. Their Tiny Desk is just another stop on the duo’s rise.

“DUMBAI”

ZVEeAxeyAPU,Rita Payés: Tiny Desk Concert,"Anamaria Sayre | October 2, 2024
Admiration is the spellbinding tenor of Rita Payés’ Tiny Desk performance.

Flanked by mother Elisabeth Roma and husband Pol Batlle, the Spanish multi-instrumentalist’s presence at the Desk reflects the way she creates and lives her music: in the cradle of familial love.

Payés performs a variety of Spanish jazz that is contemporary and nimble in its delivery, yet leans heavily on tradition. Born to a musical family in the same coastal town in Northern Spain where she now resides, she was raised surrounded by deep, musical tradition which she was able to identify as ripe for revival.

Across earlier, softer songs composed alongside her mother, to her now more grandiose string-laden, percussively rich arrangements, authentically representing her home and creating music fit for intimate exchange is always central to Payés’ craft. In the longing trill of her trombone or her sweetest vocal note, a sense of generational respect and understanding is born anew in Payés’ revered harmonies.

SET LIST
“El Cervatillo”
“Por qué Será”
“Nana Per Les Mamas”
“Quien lo diría”

1yJjALda0X4,Fabiola Méndez: Tiny Desk Concert,"This Sept. 15 to Oct. 15 NPR Music celebrates artists from all corners of Latinidad with an 'El Tiny' takeover.

Felix Contreras | September 30, 2024
The smile that erupts onto Fabiola Méndez’s face just as she launches into her first tune says everything about the joy she finds in making music that explores her culture.

Her instrument is the Puerto Rican cuatro, the national folk musical instrument of Puerto Rico. She started on the instrument at age 6 in her native Caguas, Puerto Rico, and carried it with her as her principal instrument for her studies at the prestigious Berklee School of Music in Boston.

What makes her take behind the Desk with her four piece band stand out is not just her dexterity on the instrument, but also how she incorporates tradition into a very contemporary musical setting. You can hear that musical vision and dedication to storytelling through both Méndez’s vocals and also in the song “Tributo A Mis Abuelos,” an instrumental that conjures up visions of the pastoral Puerto Rican countryside where the jibaro (rural) culture thrives.

In Méndez’s hands, the cuatro becomes not just an example of a rich, Afro-Caribbean culture, but also an instrument to spread joy. 

SET LIST
“Seis Chorreao”

vevgI9a18GQ,Ivan Cornejo: Tiny Desk Concert,"This Sept. 15 to Oct. 15 NPR Music celebrates artists from all corners of Latinidad with an 'El Tiny' takeover.

Amamaria Sayre | September 26, 2024
Whether in a stadium of 75,000 or behind a desk in an office building, Ivan Cornejo sings two notes and the heart quiets. His voice invites harmony, reflection, llorando, gritando — whatever the listener needs to feel whole again.

The 20-year-old Mexican American has emerged as a happy anomaly in recent years — a singer-songwriter who not only captivates audiences with excruciatingly descriptive lyricism but also invokes an ancestral wisdom. Cornejo voices the pains of adolescence in styles and sounds that refuse to fit boxes; he communicates in a language that makes fans feel both different and true.

The singer, endearingly nervous at the Tiny Desk, found a perfect home in the intimate space for some rockier arrangements of his hit “Ya Te Perdí” and a softer performance of the genre-pushing “Baby Please.” He ends the show with a performance of “J.,” which he dedicates to the girl who broke his heart. In Cornejo’s infinite shades of blue, we all find ourselves a little grateful for heartbreak.

Felix Contreras | September 24, 2024
Spending time with the Afro-Cuban sounds of OKAN is to be immersed in the sounds of tradition mixed with the present.

Co-leaders Elizabeth Rodriguez and Magdelys Savigne lead their five-piece band through the melodic and rhythmic celebration of their heritage with a sense of fun that can mask the intensity of the musicianship.

From the opening chant of the group’s first number “Eshu Nigüe (Elegua),” all the way through “La Reina del Norte,” OKAN is another example of musicians who honor the role of tradition while stretching the boundaries of how that tradition is expressed. And I’m not mad at the fact that every song is another reason to dance.

wC6iA_C_KC8,"Daniel, Me Estás Matando: Tiny Desk Concert","This Sept. 15 to Oct. 15 NPR Music celebrates artists from all corners of Latinidad with an 'El Tiny' takeover.

Felix Contreras | September 20, 2024
From the opening flourish of its first song, the Mexican band Daniel, Me Estás Matando, aka DMEM, makes it obvious that the group is leaning into the drama and passion of the Latin song style known as bolero. In fact, with just a hint of a raised eyebrow, the band describes its own take as “Boleroglam.”

On DMEM’s first song, it’s as if lead vocalist, drummer and band namesake Daniel Zepeda is mustering up his last bit of emotional courage to spin this tale of heartbreak. Show business schtick aside, what impresses during the group’s turn behind the Desk is the high quality of musicianship from DMEM co-leader and guitarist Iván de La Rioja and the rest of the band. The four part harmonies in only the first two minutes of the opening song reinforce the “heart on the sleeve” emotions of the genre.

If you grew up with this style of boleros, you probably imagine a group of guys in neat, three-piece suits gathered around a mic or the table at your favorite Mexican restaurant. It’s the music of our parents but in the hands and voices of Daniel, Me Estás Matando, the agony of love with these intricate harmonies becomes intergenerational.

ZfbX3MAnJUM,Danny Ocean: Tiny Desk Concert,"This Sept. 15 to Oct. 15 NPR Music celebrates artists from all corners of Latinidad with an 'El Tiny' takeover.

Isabella Gomez Sarmiento | September 18, 2024
We had no idea, when we invited Danny Ocean to the Tiny Desk, that his concert would take place amidst another wave of political protests and violent repression in his native Venezuela. Despite the tumultuous timing, Danny and his band eased right into his lover boy pop anthems “Me Rehúso,” and “Volare.” The latter, kicked off by an ingenious jingle of plastic bottle caps, transformed into a beach-side serenade complete with a saxophone and singalong. Later, during a surprise percussion breakdown in the middle of “AMOR” from his latest album REFLEXA, the Tiny Desk magic couldn’t have been clearer: a studio-polished song took on new life because the band was clearly having fun just jamming out.

Then, Ocean paused to acknowledge the crisis unfolding back home. “Venezuela, I love you with my whole heart,” he said in Spanish. “Whatever it is we’re going through, I hope we can resolve it.” Off the cuff, he played the first half of “por la pequeña Venecia” off his EP venequia. NPR staffers and guests waved Venezuelan flags; some of us got teary-eyed. But just like that, Danny Ocean and his band kept the good vibes going. The moment is indicative of the balance the artist has always managed to strike: making universal music about love and heartbreak without losing sight of the larger human struggle for peace and justice.

Felix Contreras | September 16, 2024
From the moment Colombian superstar Juanes started singing “Nada Valgo Sin Tu Amor,” we know we were in for something special.

He usually performs in arenas and stadiums all over the Spanish speaking world, but he brought his intensely personal songs to the Tiny Desk — and none of them lost their power of speaking directly to the heart.

A highpoint for me was when he converted his popular song “La Luz” into a Dominican merengue, complete with crowd singalong. But what brought the house down was his surprise encore of “A Dios Le Pido,” proving this performance celebrates the power of his artistry and the familiarity of his music in our lives.

X_myO7_7KKk,Remi Wolf: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | September 12, 2024
Just minutes into soundcheck, I realize that Remi Wolf may be a superhero who isn’t entirely aware of her powers. After wrapping song one, she asks, “Can you hear me ok out there?” I recalled a similar conversation with her last year when she popped in as a guest vocalist for Kenny Beats’ Tiny Desk, and I told her that her voice is one of the few at the Desk that cuts through every instrument played. I also knew she would be standing front and center for her own Tiny Desk at some point, and Remi’s second album, Big Ideas, is chock full of songs that fall right in the sweet spot for an excellent performance here. 

Cuts like “Motorcycle” and “Alone in Miami” provide a healthy balance between the big pop songs on Big Ideas. The restraint allows her soulful side to shine while still maintaining the quirky funk. The singer admitted that she can get bored with her songs, but thankfully she played “Sexy Villain” from her debut album that we couldn’t get enough of in 2021, Juno. This bossa nova rendition of “Sexy Villain” veers just enough to feel new while remaining true to the original.

Pu0GsALW1w8,Mdou Moctar: Tiny Desk Concert,"Lars Gotrich | September 10, 2024
As soon as Mdou Moctar plugs in at the Tiny Desk, the Saharan shred begins. The music feels midstream, as if the licks never cease in his fingers — guitar strings bend with the utmost gentility, but, in an instant, set fire to the fretboard. 

Born and based in Niger, Moctar comes from the Tuareg tradition: hypnotic desert blues that swim in rock distortion. (Think Tinariwen, Bombino and Al Bilali Soudan, all of whom have played Tiny Desk in their own distinct styles.) For more than a decade, Moctar has built an extensive repertoire that not only mesmerizes musically but also speaks to the joy of his homeland and resistance to those who exploit its people. 

Unlike his acoustic-driven Tiny Desk (home) concert, Moctar and his berobed band here play up the chunky riffs and body-rattling volume of 2024’s Funeral for Justice: Orange amps, Fender Strats and, for this occasion, a kick-and-djembe combo that absolutely whips. Moctar’s aim is true: a plea, in Tamasheq, to preserve Niger’s native tongue (“Imouhar”); a protest against politicians who sell out Africa’s land and resources (“Funeral for Justice”); a battle versus inner demons (“Takoba”). In these songs, there’s a righteous fury, to be sure, but also a reminder that the good fight is always worth fighting.

ranwgb7qkNk,Pygmy Lush: Tiny Desk Concert,"Lars Gotrich | August 30, 2024
How rare is it for the same group of musicians to create not one but two beloved bands of the punk scene? Around the turn of the millennium, pg. 99 pushed heavy music to its most chaotic extremes, inspiring tattoos and the next generation of hardcore. Then a few members of pg. 99 started Pygmy Lush —  something quieter and sweeter, though no less experimental. 

Pygmy Lush never broke up, life just happened; this Tiny Desk is the atmospheric folk band’s first live performance in seven years. While its catalog can get noisy, Pygmy Lush here relies on haunted campfire singalongs from 2008’s Mount Hope (“Asphalt,” “Dead Don’t Pass” and “Hard to Swallow”) and “It’s a Good Day to Hide” from its split LP with the hardcore band Turboslut. Like those records, the foundations here are simple — acoustic guitars, looped melodies, repeated phrases, hushed vocals — but its gentle swells allow small feelings to grow roots and wander.  

Blood and chosen family surrounds this set. Chris and Mike Taylor’s mother came to see Pygmy Lush perform for the very first time — the way they lit up when she entered the NPR Music office is too precious for words. Johnny Ward’s mother sat beside her. Mike Widman’s eldest daughter sings on “Hard to Swallow.” And, because Pygmy Lush has always featured an orbit of collaborators, Aimée Argote from the shapeshifting indie-rock band Des Ark plays piano and sings — their touch is so delicate, yet gives the monochromatic mood so much color. 

Pygmy Lush closes this Tiny Desk with “I’ll Wait with You,” a personal request of mine. In years previous, I’ve seen the band howl its catharsis with deafening volume: “To the end,” a declaration of friendship forged in and through hardship. An unbreakable bond. Here, the scream becomes a smile, a promise.

3ibSXC3vo8M,Lainey Wilson: Tiny Desk Concert,"Stephen Thompson | August 27, 2024
Lainey Wilson took a long, winding path to country-music stardom, beginning with a high school stint as a Hannah Montana impersonator. That path led the Louisiana native to a Grammy for best country album earlier this year — for her terrific 2022 breakthrough, Bell Bottom Country — and it continues with Whirlwind, which dropped Friday.

Just days before the new album’s release, Wilson took yet another victory lap at the Tiny Desk, where she performed three songs from Whirlwind before closing with the first single from Bell Bottom Country, “Heart Like a Truck.” Though she and her band opened the set with two killer songs about romantic devotion, the show’s grabbiest moments — and the ones likeliest to go viral — came during the irreverent “Ring Finger,” a kiss-off song for the ages. (How we made it to 2024 without a banger containing the words “I got the ring / He got the finger” will have to remain a mystery.)

The whole deeply charming set announced Wilson as a star with staying power. She’ll maintain a presence at the Tiny Desk, too: She left us her hat for safekeeping.

yQ7E1c2ykeM,Katy Kirby: Tiny Desk Concert,"Elle Mannion | August 26, 2024
Texas-born Katy Kirby has a talent for creating songs that start quietly — so tenderly that the listener almost feels like they’re eavesdropping on a personal conversation — then build with intricate arrangements before returning to that intimacy. It’s that sort of dynamism, paired with Kirby’s clear voice and distinctive lyrical imagery, that really shine in her Tiny Desk performance.

Kirby begins with “Juniper,” a swinging hit from her debut album Cool Dry Place, followed by “Fences,” off her latest album Blue Raspberry. On “Cubic Zirconia,” after an instrumental break led by Logan Chung’s electric guitar riffs, the band fades as Kirby sings to “the prettiest mermaid in the souvenir shop,” describing a “face framed by hoodie like an oyster in a shell.” Kirby then plays a stripped back version of the usually roaring “Table” before ending with the arresting “Portals,” a song Kirby told us tends to make her girlfriend tear up. 

Also, you may notice that the “woohoo!” sounds from the audience sound a bit higher pitched than usual. That’s because Kirby was playing to an audience of young musicians attending the Girls Rock! DC day camp, hosted at NPR headquarters the day of this recording. We're glad Kirby could show them what it's like to rock out at the Tiny Desk.

Zig0cfRdqsE,Maxwell: Tiny Desk Concert,"Mitra I. Arthur | August 23, 2024
Have you ever been in a room where you can feel a palpable, collective swooning? Welcome to a Maxwell Tiny Desk. The crooner’s sensual falsetto and rooted baritone have seduced audiences since his debut album dropped in 1996. One of the leading voices in the resurgence of soul music during the late ’90s, Maxwell’s albums are full of tender songs recounting love, life and heartbreak that have resonated with generations of fans looking for ways to be vulnerable.

Clad in soothing neutrals, Maxwell charmingly admitted his nervousness at being at the Desk, stating that “This is where real music can’t lie. You cannot lie here.” The audience was there with encouragement — singing along, screaming in pure glee and adding the party vibe when needed. His set here featured “Sumthin' Sumthin'” complete with a funky bass solo from Darrell ""Free"" Freeman. “Lifetime” features impressive work from Travis Sayles on the keys and Shedrick “Shed” Mitchell on the Hammond B3 organ, an instrument I’m admittedly partial to. Maxwell presented his latest single during this set, a cover of the Al Green classic “Simply Beautiful,” breathing life into the song and paying homage to the soul singer. To end his set, Maxwell performed the song that launched his career, “Ascension (Don't Ever Wonder).” Percussionist Charles Haynes gave us a little D.C. go-go flavor as everyone partied.

ipFtGz0_dAg,Keyon Harrold: Tiny Desk Concert,"Nikki Birch | August 15, 2024
It's a family reunion when jazz, R&B and hip-hop get together, and Keyon Harrold brought it all to his Tiny Desk, where he talked about “the good, the band, and the ugly of what life can be.”

“Gotta Go (Outer Space),” set the table for the affair, introducing Harrold and the killin’ musicians in the rhythm section and giving them a chance to settle in before special guests arrived. “Find Your Peace,” is about letting go. Seasoned with a verse from Nick Grant, a sprinkle of Rhodes by jazz rockstar, Robert Glasper, and a dash of featured vocalist, Tiana Major9, it was a tasty first course.

The title track of Harrold’s latest album, “Foreverland,” is love and longing brought to the table by STOUT. Together, with Harrold taking turns as a vocalist, they told a story about the possibilities of a dreamy romance with the support of Michelle Hunt and Mary Floyd singing background vocals. The next dish is an entrée consumed, perhaps, with a bit of reluctance. “Don’t Lie,” features Malaya pleading for answers, to which Harrold responds with a reassuring trumpet solo.

It’s apparent from everyone’s smiles, whether performing songs about joy or yearning, that they’re family creating a memory. Harrold spoke about a lesson he learned recently: friendship is an essential ingredient that nourishes the soul. For the final course, he and longtime friend PJ Morton proclaim that, with the right perspective, everyday is a “Beautiful Day.”

OO6QUgGMp2A,Sierra Ferrell: Tiny Desk Concert,"Ann Powers | August 14, 2024
Sierra Ferrell is the May Queen of American roots music — no matter what month it is. For her summertime stop at the Tiny Desk, the West Virginia native adorned herself in garb befitting Florence Pugh’s star turn in Midsommar, a trail of cloth pansies encircling her eyes. Ferrell, whose 2024 album is appropriately called Trail of Flowers, quickly showed that her finery wouldn’t get in the way of a stellar musical performance; her fiddling in this set’s first song “I Could Drive You Crazy” anchored both the band and the entire performance in the technically challenging yet boisterous, bluegrass-meets-old-timey sound that’s made Ferrell a fast-rising star alongside friends like Billy Strings and Zach Bryan. Focusing on the music, only pausing for some whimsical banter about the legendary city of tunnels that lies beneath Washington, D.C., Ferrell showed how her blend of warmth, chops and inventiveness is remaking Americana music.

A former busker who learned roots music during her itinerant twenties, Ferrell shows no fealty to any one style while honoring many in her sparkling, insightful songs. For “Dollar Bill Bar” she switched to guitar and sang with the sexy ease of a young Bonnie Raitt as Oliver Bates Craven spooled out some Beatles-esque guitar licks. (He and mandolinist Josh Rilko have played with Ferrell off and on since she first wowed Nashvillians a decade ago on hipster nights at the American Legion Hall.) Then the band shifts to a Spanish stroll for “In Dreams,” throws in a bluegrass breakdown, and ends the set with the beautiful “American Dreaming,” a ballad that Linda Ronstadt might have recorded in her early days. No circus hoop descended for Ferrell to grab and levitate — as she did at her last Nashville New Year’s Eve show — but she’d still managed to fill the Tiny Desk with sparkle and joy.

wlsmFJx5vH0,Chucho Valdés: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | August 12, 2024
Pianist Chucho Valdés is the past, present and future of Cuban piano.
Throughout over six decades as a professional musician, he has performed in a variety of small groups and large orchestras, always incorporating the influence of Africa, Spain and jazz from the United States. As the son of pianist and composer Bebo Valdés, he was raised with a connection to over 100 years of Cuban piano tradition, studying pianists from Havana at the turn of the 20th century as a child. 

You can hear how Valdés absorbed the lessons of the pianists who came before him in this stunning solo performance, delving into the most forward thinking piano improvisations that blend jazz, classical and Cuban tradition. One of those moments is on full display about four minutes into the first tune: his left hand is deftly playing one of his signature tunes, “Mambo Influenciado,” while his right hand is reaching into the outer limits of harmony, melody and rhythm. His turn on what he called “Impromptu Desk” is a rare opportunity to witness how his musical mind wanders from jazz to blues to haunting melodies. 

In his 80s, Valdés still displays the bottomless fountain of creativity with small group performances, the occasional solo piano gig and reviving the groundbreaking band Irakere. It was an incredible personal treat to host him behind the Desk and have him transport us.

VKvYRDhPt_0,DEVO: Tiny Desk Concert,"Robin Hilton | August 9, 2024
Shortly before beginning the band’s set, Devo frontman Mark Mothersbaugh learned we have a closet full of stage props and costumes, everything from lab coats and wigs to a rubber chicken and fake blood.  After quickly rummaging through the boxes and racks of clothes, he returned with a stack of hats that he eventually — and repeatedly — swapped out during a sometimes breathless performance.

The band’s set included songs members say they hadn’t performed in more than 40 years, opening with “It Takes a Worried Man,” a track Devo had originally recorded for the little-known 1982 comedy film Human Highway. The group also performed a skittering version of 1979’s “Blockhead,” and “Come Back Jonee” from the band’s 1978 debut album Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!

Now 74, Mothersbaugh hasn’t slowed down or lost the playfully subversive style that’s defined his time with Devo, at one point working his way into the audience with a megaphone to ask people just inches away what they’re doing with their hands (for the song “Praying Hands”).  

Devo’s set comes after releasing a career-spanning box set, 50 Years of De-Evolution (1973-2023), late last year.

GYmYQvkGlro,Shae Universe: Tiny Desk Concert,"Ashley Pointer | August 6, 2024
I just happened to be looking out of the office window when British-Nigerian singer-songwriter Shae Universe first pulled up outside of NPR HQ, just in time to see her take it all in. It was evidently a surreal moment for her as an up-and-coming artist, but once she began to fill the room up with her unique and stunning voice, it was clear that she had arrived — not just at the Tiny Desk, but effervescently onto America’s R&B and soul scene.

“This moment right here is not just one for British culture and R&B, this is for the independent artists, this is for the self-managed artists, this is for the darker-skinned Black women, this is for the shy ones with undeniable gifts, this is for the slow-burners,” Universe says in her set. Performing selections from her most recent album, Love’s Letter, Universe takes us on a journey of love in this concert in all forms: lust, romance and self-love. On “You Lose” she also takes a moment to pay homage to her early days as the pioneer of the U.K. subgenre R&Drill, where we hear her flex not only her smooth vocals but her bars with admirable precision. Universe closes out the show with “More Than Enough,” a gospel-infused ballad. It was beautiful witnessing her sing these affirmations for herself, and made me so excited for those who will discover her for the first time through this concert. Prepare yourself.

cMW779WaDXs,Alana Springsteen: Tiny Desk Concert,"Robin Hilton | August 5, 2024
We first started talking with Alana Springsteen about a Tiny Desk concert more than a year ago, back when she began releasing the three EPs that would make up her stunning debut album Twenty Something. By the time we finally got her in the office, she showed up ready to make it count, with a carefully arranged setlist she delivered in an impossible-to-miss, bright red, leather suit, backed by an incredible band.

Springsteen’s set featured multiple surprises, including a version of the Tiësto song “Hot Honey” (a track she guested on when Tiësto released it last month). She also performed a brand new song we’re premiering called “feels good,” a twisted tale about flirting with death, going to extremes and self-sabotage.

Springsteen also included a slow-burning version of “ghost in my guitar,” swapping the electric guitar performed by Chris Stapleton on her album for a cello, before closing with a stripped-down version of the title cut to Twenty Something, a deeply moving coming-of-age song that left a lot of us at the office in tears.

yUBvP_Rj-SY,The LOX: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | August 2, 2024
Experience with a live band is a prerequisite for most artists who want to play the Tiny Desk. The space isn’t kind to groups who aren’t locked in with each other and it will fully expose a lack of preparation. In the case of The LOX, chemistry has allowed the group to prevail in any environment. It’s the primary element of the trio’s longevity, so we all took a chance to build this performance from scratch. It took the audience a second to figure out what was happening, but the “woos” in tandem with the music affirmed everything. After 30 years in the game, we experienced The LOX, fresh and new again.

The trio of Jadakiss, Styles P, and Sheek Louch might not spring to mind when it comes to rappers who work with live bands. Established in Yonkers, N.Y., in the 1990s, the group specializes in gritty street anthems, usually best presented with two turntables and a microphone. The LOX utilized the typical tools of the trade three years ago to dominate The Diplomats and reinvigorate the rappers’ careers in their Verzuz battle. The band assembled here consists of Tiny Desk alumnus Carrtoons and Kiefer, Daru Jones on drums and vocalist Le’Asha. The arrangements added a level of sophistication never heard before from The LOX, and for the grand finale, they brought a string section — or “more band,” as Styles put it.

BIY_lEg8kBA,Kehlani: Tiny Desk Concert,"Alanté Serene | July 31, 2024
When I first heard Kehlani’s debut mixtape, it was a comfort that reminded me of home. The proud Oakland, Calif. native was 19 years old when that project dropped, and so was I. The tracklist was exactly what I needed as a new Washington, D.C. transplant, thousands of miles away from all of my loved ones in the Bay Area. Over the past decade I’ve followed Kehlani along their journey, growing with them as we both experienced young adulthood. Vulnerability is their superpower, and that power was put to the test at the Tiny Desk, where Kehlani succeeds with flying colors.

“It’s been a long time coming. I definitely know I’m overdue for doing this [Tiny Desk],” Kehlani says in their set. The journey starts with “Nights Like This,” the heartbreak single from their 2019 mixtape, While We Wait. Then, Kehlani switches gears into “Distraction,” from their debut album SweetSexySavage, followed by an effortless merge into “The Way,” from the 2015 project, You Should Be Here. 

After the sultry sounds of “Can I,” Kehlani parks their performance for a moment. “I want to take a second to say: Free Palestine. Free Congo. Free Sudan. Free Yemen. Free Hawaii. Free Guam,” they say. “It’s deeper than this. I need everybody that’s here right now, everybody that’s watching, to step up, to use their voices.” The set then accelerates into “After Hours,” the groovy, summertime anthem from their latest album, CRASH. Kehlani conquers the Desk with raw and real talent, setting them up for a future in music that is full of possibilities. I’m eager to see their next destination.

K8VetbXWbFM,Ryan Leslie: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | July 26, 2024
Ryan Leslie was in go mode as he arrived at NPR headquarters after an early morning road trip from New York. He bounced all over the space even when the cameras weren’t rolling. I was curious to hear how he would take his big, synth-heavy sound and adapt it to the Tiny Desk, but then was quickly reminded that at his core, he’s a creator. Leslie made songs like “Diamond Girl,” “How It Was Supposed To Be” and Cassie’s “Long Way 2 Go,” so to watch him recreate them here with ease shouldn’t have been a surprise.

After writing and producing Cassie’s debut album and hits for others, the singer-songwriter and entrepreneur decided to focus on being a solo artist. It’s not easy to go into a studio by yourself and walk out with a complete album, but R. Les is that artist. The viral video of him creating “Addiction” is remarkable proof. In 2013, he walked away from the traditional music industry, removing his music from streaming services and created a new platform utilizing his social media following to promote and sell his work. Unlike many in Leslie’s class of producers from the early 2000s, he crafted a distinctive style, branching out and creating high demand as a writer and producer. It’s a style, proven here at his Tiny Desk, to be timeless.

kIBTww3U30M,Feist: Tiny Desk Concert,"Stephen Thompson | July 24, 2024
There’s always been a disconnect between Leslie Feist’s music — soothing, thoughtful, deliberately crafted — and her warm, wryly funny personality. We got to witness both in her long-awaited Tiny Desk debut, which finds her showcasing new and old material amid self-effacing commentary on the pandemic, public speaking and her strange moment of reality-TV fame.

“The great joke that will always remain about [her song ‘Hiding Out in the Open’] is that we ended up singing it to contestants on The Bachelor — where true love rules all, of course,” Feist said between songs. “So singing truisms about eternal love to youth on a game show changed the context forever.”

Performing two songs from last year’s wonderful Multitudes (“In Lightning” and “Hiding Out in the Open”) and two songs from 2011’s Metals (“Caught a Long Wind” and “The Bad in Each Other”), Feist was joined by a group of players and singers who’ve each performed notable work in their own right: Keyboardist Rose Droll is a terrific solo singer-songwriter, drummer Andrew Barr plays in The Slip and The Barr Brothers, bassist Todd Dahlhoff often plays and records with Devendra Banhart and Meshell Ndegeocello, and multi-instrumentalist Amir Yaghmai is a member of The Voidz. Together, though, they sound like one impeccable organism, with Feist herself as its bold, unfailingly kind beating heart.

6jYtRQ2tHGg,Norah Jones: Tiny Desk Concert,"Mitra I. Arthur | July 22, 2024
“I finally made it to Tiny Desk,” singer-songwriter Norah Jones excitedly declares during her performance. Her first Tiny Desk experience was a solo piano and vocal (home) concert, which reflected all the meditative, sonic hallmarks of performing in isolation. Since her juggernaut debut album, Come Away With Me, was released in 2002, she has crafted intimate songs that showcase her beguiling vocals. In the course of building her genre expansive catalog, she has racked up nine Grammy awards and collaborations with as varied a group as you can imagine, from Herbie Hancock and Willie Nelson, to Q-Tip and Foo Fighters.

For her long-awaited in-person performance, Jones presents a light, breezy set of soulful tracks from her newest album, Visions, a collaboration with producer Leon Michels. “Paradise,” a deceptively light and whimsical tune about letting go, begins the concert, followed by the contemplative “Swept Up in the Night.” For the psychedelic “Staring at the Wall,” featuring Jones on the guitar, drummer Brian Blade and bassist Josh Lattanzi lay down a fun, body-moving groove. To close her set, Jones turns to the title track from her debut album, disclosing that the tune was written only using the five guitar chords she knew at the time. Here she reimagines her classic, opening it up in a dreamy fashion.

PCgB07Yy6Xs,Álvaro Díaz: Tiny Desk Concert,"Anamaria Sayre | July 19, 2024
Puerto Rican rapper Álvaro Díaz’s fresh take on his greatest hits at the Tiny Desk brought all the sal and soul of the Isla to NPR.

Opening with jazzy piano and synth riffs that evoked a sweet ocean breeze on “Todo Bien,” he quickly set the tone for the concert, throwing a shout-out to his mama, the inspiration for the track. Switching to “Chicas de la Isla,” he used smooth, electric guitar and stunning background vocals for a rendition of the first song he ever made, conveying a relaxed energy fit for a jam with friends.

After years of collaborating with all kinds of Puerto Rican artists from Jowell & Randy to Bad Bunny and everyone in between, despite being center stage for his Tiny Desk, Díaz took the opportunity to share the space with a whole crowd of Tiny Desk veterans and newcomers from all across the island. The community feel of his music fueled the energy and excellence of every single musician he shared the Desk with.

ad8bvpdoEqE,Phish: Tiny Desk Concert,"Maia Stern | July 17, 2024
Trey Anastasio is no stranger to the Tiny Desk, having performed a solo set in 2015. Bassist Mike Gordon and drummer Jon Fishman also performed for our Tiny Desk (home) concert series in 2020 with guitarist Leo Kottke. And now, finally, we get a full Phish Tiny Desk concert.

The set began with “Sigma Oasis,” which included a little musical reference to the All Things Considered theme song. The band continued with “Evolve,” a track from its 16th studio album released last week. Before the band’s final song, Anastasio and Gordon warmed up their fingers on tiny trampolines, which likely had the uninitiated scratching their heads. But for fans of this band, it was a clear signal of what was coming next: “You Enjoy Myself,” a song that dates back to the band’s beginnings and can safely be called a Phish classic. In live performances, the jam segment features choreographed bouncing, and the band brought that spectacle right into our office.

After, the band ended its set and swerved out slowly through the crowd, singing while giving out high fives. But the audience's applause didn’t stop, so Phish came back out and played two bonus tracks: “Sample in a Jar” and “Chalk Dust Torture.” “When we started the band, we used to practice in a room exactly this size… it was probably smaller,” Anastasio shared. What a gift to get to watch Phish perform in a similarly sized room 41 years later.

_1V_PGElOHs,Nathy Peluso: Tiny Desk Concert,"Anamaria Sayre | July 15, 2024
Ever the queen of self-assured experimentation, Spanish-Argentine artist Nathy Peluso brought all of her genre-bending, vocal powerhouse energy to her Tiny Desk concert.

Playing with the flow of urban sounds and salsa beats, the singer showcased the most jazzy, feel-good, playful parts of her discography in the acoustic space. Hopping from up-tempo tracks like “LEGENDARIO” with leading percussion and bass, to the soulful and wildly skilled vocal performance of “ENVIDIA,” Peluso delivered a versed ode to Latin American and Spanish rhythms.
 
Peluso is a master of the unexpected, and from first note to last the concert represented what an artist can bring when they highlight the full breadth of their vision. Prepared to show the world what an Argentine-born, Spanish-raised artist can play with in a more wildly diverse Spanish-speaking diaspora than ever before, Peluso came and rompió.

XDNyVy-wGuY,The Wiz: Tiny Desk Concert,"Mitra I. Arthur | July 12, 2024
One afternoon the Tiny Desk traveled to Emerald City. Or rather, we got to meet the cast of the newest Broadway revival of The Wiz. Debuting in Baltimore, Md. in 1974, the musical unapologetically centered Black culture in its reenvisioning of The Wizard Of Oz and helped usher in a new era of Black theatrical storytelling. In its various stage productions and 1978 screen adaptation, audiences for The Wiz get to see a futuristic and fantastical depiction of the Black imagination. As an 8-year-old, seeing The Wiz ignited my love of musical theater. I have no doubt countless audiences will feel the same joy and awe I felt when this new imagining of The Wiz goes back on tour at the top of 2025.

The mystique in Alan Mingo, Jr.'s performance of “Meet the Wizard” as The Wiz illustrates that even when Broadway casts visit the Tiny Desk out of costume and away from their sets, they can’t help but channel the physicality of the characters they portray eight times a week. Melody A. Betts’ Aunt Em provides a loving but firm correction of Dorothy (Nichelle Lewis) in “The Feeling We Once Had” that is both warm and familiar. Avery Wilson’s voice elastically dances up and down the notes in “You Can’t Win,” mimicking the way his limbs move as the Scarecrow. Phillip Johnson Richardson’s gut-wrenching performance of “What Would I Do If I Could Feel” will have your heart bursting and make you want to offer it to his Tinman. And the charming Kyle Ramar Freeman gave us all the ultimate false bravado and bluster of the Lion in “Mean Ole Lion.”

The show’s finale, “Home,” was particularly special for Virginia native Nichelle Lewis. Her vulnerable performance had the audience, which included her mother, cheering her on. As Lewis’ fellow cast members enveloped her in hugs after her performance, we were reminded of the same lessons that Dorothy learns in the show: Home isn’t just a physical space, it’s the people who build you up and love you.

xjVx3Wcoolo,Julius Rodriguez: Tiny Desk Concert,"Ashley Pointer | July 10, 2024
There was a palpable curiosity in the audience as to who Julius Rodriguez was before the artist and his band took their places behind the Desk. But the crowd was headbanging as soon as the grooves started. The band’s energy emanated into the crowd, and it was like we were teleported to a house show with old friends. There weren’t many words exchanged throughout this 23-minute set, just hearty laughs and chuckles, juxtaposed by virtuosic playing.  “I’m not a big words guy,” Rodriguez said towards the end of his performance, “but I will say that being here is such an honor and a dream come true. I’m very glad to have some of my best friends and the greatest musicians in the world with me.”
 
While the New York-bred and Los Angeles-based pianist and multi-instrumentalist has been regarded as a young master in the jazz world, his sophomore album, Evergreen, expands his sound beyond any simple categorization. Backed by Brian Richburg Jr on drums, Philip Norris on upright bass, Alonzo Demetrius on trumpet and Chris Lewis on sax, they kick off the performance with the infectious, gospel-tinged “Run To It (The CP Song).”  Rodriguez follows with the uplifting “Around The World,” as he shows off his chops in a dizzying whirl of solos that transition seamlessly into a moving tribute, “Elegy (For Cam),” dedicated to the late actor Cameron Boyce, and then into the lush and soulful “Love Everlasting.” Returning to his debut album Let Sound Tell All, Rodriguez closes his set with “Gift Of The Moon.”

zoAs0-nXPQM,Silvia Pérez Cruz: Tiny Desk Concert,"Anamaria Sayre | July 9, 2024
Spanish singer Silvia Pérez Cruz grew up in the cradle of magnificent extremes. Her hometown Palafrugell on the Costa Brava of the Mediterranean sea is renowned as much for its stunning turquoise waters and dazzling summer sun as it is for biting bitter winds and unforgiving winter nights.

Amidst that chaos her songs were born: brilliantly distinct little capsules of human experience. Whether singing about joy, pain, grief or curiosity, that duality between sunshine and gray skies is present in her work.

“Yo soy inescrutable (I am inscrutable),” she cries on “Salir distinto.” Her emotive, jazz-tinged voice and ’54 acoustic guitar (she picked it up at a vintage shop some years ago in New York) transcends time and physical space. “Yo prefiero el desastre / Y escucharte sin perjuicio (I prefer disaster / And to listen to you without prejudice),” she coos. And in this moment, she’s impossible to turn away from — a vessel for eons of melancholic Mediterranean secrets at the Tiny Desk.

v1VLZnBEw_M,María José Llergo: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | July 8, 2024
In the moment that María José Llergo took her place behind the Tiny Desk, those of us lucky enough to be in the audience (and now anyone who watches the video document it — lucky you) were transported to her native Andalusia in southern Spain, the traditional home of flamenco.

But the Spanish music scene that Llergo is part of is exploding with new energy, too. Her vocals are based in the Arab-influenced vocal trilling of cante jondo, but like many artists from Spain these days, she uses tradition as a springboard for stylistic mash-ups with hip-hop, R&B and jazz.

Her cross-genre expressions display a nuanced balance of her respect for the deeply-ingrained cultural influences left over from the 16th century that is her family background as well as 21st century music that is her day-to-day reality.

Llergo’s performance is propelled by a vivacious spirit, and her final song, “LO QUE SIENTO,” is a meditation on and homage to what it means to be a Spanish musician in this moment when the boundaries of genre and tradition can be both celebrated and expanded.

DYDLYlhvJho,Laura Jane Grace & the Mississippi Medicals: Tiny Desk Concert,"Lars Gotrich | July 3, 2024
The set list kept changing, right up until showtime. Laura Jane Grace had to cram more than two decades of music — both solo material and from her influential punk band Against Me! — into 15 minutes. Her band was used to this gleeful chaos. Grace's wife, Paris Campbell Grace, Drive-By Truckers' Matt Patton and The Ergs' Mikey Erg make up the Mississippi Medicals, a loving and stabilizing force for a catalog of songs about American injustice, creative frustration, identity and broken promises… but also hope through collective action and personal revelation. In this Tiny Desk, you'll see them play newer songs (""I'm Not a Cop"" and ""All F***** Out""), but also throwbacks to “Pints of Guinness Make You Strong” (a personal request) and an absolutely powerful version of ""Black Me Out.""

An Against Me! show changed my life. Before Grace's set, I shared a story about a sweet, sheltered suburban kid who spent his freshman year at shows instead of studying for class. (I lost my college scholarship, but, hey it worked out for me in the end.) Reinventing Axl Rose had just come out, but everyone knew every single word. In the small living room, the mass of bodies moved like high tide, pushing and pulling as we gleefully sang, “ ‘Cause, baby, I’m an anarchist / And you’re a spineless liberal."" We knew that the world can be rotten and cruel, yet could be beautiful, too, in how we fight for freedom together. At one point, the swell spilled over and I fell out the back door, then was quickly pulled back up because that’s what we do when someone falls.

Walking back to my dorm room afterward, beaming and bruised, I had a realization: Punk is complex and contradictory; it will fail and frustrate you… but it will also set you free. That paradox still haunts and challenges me, but I wear these songs — and all that have come after — like armor.

Vrk2Q9AZrYI,SWV: Tiny Desk Concert,"This Black Music Month, Tiny Desk is giving the ladies their flowers. We’re releasing nine Tiny Desk concerts from Black women artists, from veterans who’ve paved the way for what we hear today in Black music, to those who are carving out their own paths.

Bobby Carter | June 28, 2024
We conclude 2024’s Black Music Month celebration at the Tiny Desk with the catalyst for the all-female lineup, SWV. Year after year, I’ve begged who I consider the greatest girl group ever to come play the Desk. Like the other Black women we’ve hosted this month, SWV has yet to receive the proper acknowledgment for its influence over the past three decades. There was a moment, similar to the sing-along portion of Chaka Khan’s show, when Coko, Taj and Lelee were taken aback while the audience kept the party going after the band stopped playing “I’m So Into You.”

Sisters With Voices originated in the church before the group started recording R&B music. It broke through in the 1990s, a decade that was the pinnacle of girl groups. In a landscape including En Vogue, TLC, Xscape and dozens more, SWV remained in front of the pack, topping the charts, amassing gold and platinum plaques and breaking new ground in music, style and sexual liberation. Before playing “You’re The One,” Lelee introduced the song, reminding us that they “kinda took a beating for the team because our music was a little risqué.”

As a new appreciation for ’90s R&B has emerged over the past several years, SWV has reigned supreme. Watching the audience sway and sing to songs like “Weak” and “Rain,” I’m reminded of the lasting quality of SWV that continues to connect us.

HSzoKlaD9Gs,Flo Milli: Tiny Desk Concert,"This Black Music Month, Tiny Desk is giving the ladies their flowers. We’re releasing nine Tiny Desk concerts from Black women artists, from veterans who’ve paved the way for what we hear today in Black music, to those who are carving out their own paths.

Ashley Pointer | June 26, 2024
The Tiny Desk has humbled many artists, but Flo Milli strutted into NPR HQ and behind the Desk with the unwavering confidence of an OG. While her appearance gave soft and feminine, clothed in blush pink with baby’s breath scattered throughout her hair, Milli’s lyrical prowess sliced like a sword. Her bars were bratty and braggadocious alongside Atlanta’s own Band of Brothers and her background singers she dubbed “The Floettes.” 

Flo Milli has carved out her own lane in hip-hop. At just 24 years old, she’s dropped a trilogy of albums — 2020’s Ho, Why Is You Here?, 2022's You Still Here, Ho? and 2024’s Fine Ho, Stay — and scored her first Billboard Hot 100 charting single with the infectious “Never Lose Me.” Performing with a live band for the first time, we get a taste of each of these albums in her performance. The opener, a medley of “Conceited” and “Bed Time,” gets a rock makeover with some heavy keybass and electric guitar. Then, Milli and her band take us back to her debut days with the song that put her on the map, “Beef FloMix,” which takes on a soulful, guitar-led makeover. Closing her set with a treat, the band exchange their instruments for acoustic guitars to perform a special rendition of “Never Lose Me” — with a new verse, exclusively for the Tiny Desk audience.

Ov882wRp12Y,Brittney Spencer: Tiny Desk Concert,"This Black Music Month, Tiny Desk is giving the ladies their flowers. We’re releasing nine Tiny Desk concerts from Black women artists, from veterans who’ve paved the way for what we hear today in Black music, to those who are carving out their own paths.

Suraya Mohamed | June 21, 2024
Brittney Spencer arrived at the Tiny Desk holding Reppie, her green stuffed dinosaur, tightly under her arm. She smiled as she looked around the office, taking it all in. Perhaps she was thinking about her journey and the many years it took to get to this moment — singing as a girl in church in Baltimore, moving to Nashville to pursue a music career full time and the challenges she has faced as a Black woman trying to break into the country music scene.

A part of a new generation of country music artists who are pushing boundaries, Spencer is a celebrated singer-songwriter who is quickly rising in the genre. Her debut album, My Stupid Life, came out earlier this year and this set features many of those songs. Each is a personal story shaped by the different kinds of music she loves, all woven together with a country sensibility. She told the audience halfway through the set, “This album really cracked me wide open and it made me feel a little more honest.”

Vulnerability is one of the many strengths that highlights her beauty. “Is there lipstick on my teeth?” she asked playfully right after the concert. “That was literally my thought through the whole show.” Then she took Reppy off the Desk and tenderly shared that he was her emotional support animal. She hugged him hard and decided to leave him behind on our shelves.

XBuOd2MzdT4,Meshell Ndegeocello: Tiny Desk Concert,"This Black Music Month, Tiny Desk is giving the ladies their flowers. We’re releasing nine Tiny Desk concerts from Black women artists, from veterans who’ve paved the way for what we hear today in Black music, to those who are carving out their own paths.

Nikki Birch | June 18, 2024
Experiencing all of the Tiny Desks this Black Music Month has made many of my dreams come true, and Meshell Ndegeocello’s performance was no exception. For 30 years the Grammy-winning artist’s music has cast an unflinching gaze on love, race, sexuality and religion. Her new album out in August, No More Water: The Gospel of James Baldwin, zooms out to focus on the love of humanity as inspired by the writer and civil rights activist.

Her performance includes three songs from that album, starting with “Travel,” which features Kenita Miller’s swirling whispers alongside Jake Sherman’s organ and Ndegeocello’s bass, which ushers us into her church service. “Thus Sayeth The Lorde,” references the writings of Audre Lorde: “If I did not define myself for myself, I’d be crunched into other people’s fantasies for me and eaten alive.” This conviction has been the binding agent of Ndegeocello’s career. Releasing her debut album at a time when many of the women who dominated Black music were singers who adopted an ultra-feminine aesthetic, as a bassist and vocalist she gallantly eschewed that standard for androgyny, fully embracing her queer, two-spirit identity.

“Love” continues this theme, urging you to allow love to take over and accept yourself in the face of existential crisis. The final songs of Ndegeocello’s Tiny Desk Concert are fan favorites. First, we’re sent off into space with the playful “Virgo,” from Ndegeocello’s album The Omnichord Real Book. Then she brings us back to Earth with the yearning “Outside Your Door.”

W9r2i8EjFVw,Kierra Sheard: Tiny Desk Concert,"This Black Music Month, Tiny Desk is giving the ladies their flowers. We’re releasing nine Tiny Desk concerts from Black women artists, from veterans who’ve paved the way for what we hear today in Black music, to those who are carving out their own paths.

Mitra I. Arthur | June 14, 2024
After a moment of praise in her set, Kierra Sheard said jokingly, “I don’t wanna make this Tiny Desk Sunday morning service.” That ability to unapologetically speak on faith in any location, even the Tiny Desk, is a hallmark of Gospel music and a strength of Sheard’s. Since her solo debut at 17, Sheard has released music that keeps God’s word at the forefront, while being packaged to reach audiences who might not be in the church pew on Sunday mornings. That music has garnered her several Dove and Stellar awards, as well as multiple Grammy nominations. She and her brother, producer and drummer J. Drew Sheard II, learned music ministry under the tutelage of their mother, Karen Clark-Sheard, and aunts, who make up the legendary gospel group The Clark Sisters.

In our meeting prior to filming her Tiny Desk, Sheard asked “Can I get at least one run?” To which our team replied “Absolutely — more than one!” Those soul stirring runs are present in this uplifting medley of new cuts from her latest album, All Yours, and tracks from her 20 year catalog. “You Ain’t Seen Nothing Yet” aptly introduces Sheard’s presence at the Tiny Desk. I found myself continually singing “All Yours” and “Hang On” for days after the performance. Her testimony in “It Keeps Happening” and “Something Has To Break” moved many in our office as Sheard declared, “What I can’t do, God can do!” And in classic church “turn to your neighbor” fashion, she implored the audience to “Turn to somebody and say I’m supposed to be here!” There is no doubt Sheard is supposed to be at the Tiny Desk.

Gse1LKXuV2M,Chaka Khan: Tiny Desk Concert,"This Black Music Month, Tiny Desk is giving the ladies their flowers. We’re releasing nine Tiny Desk concerts from Black women artists, from veterans who’ve paved the way for what we hear today in Black music, to those who are carving out their own paths.

Mitra I. Arthur | June 11, 2024
When the “Queen of Funk,” Chaka Khan, began to sing her hit “Sweet Thing” at the Tiny Desk, she seemed surprised at how the audience enthusiastically joined in. It’s just one example of how ingrained her work is in the fabric of music history. Since she emerged in the 1970s with the funk band Rufus, Khan has crafted a legacy that includes 22 albums, 10 Grammys, forays into jazz and theater and collaborations with Prince, Stevie Wonder, Joni Mitchell and Quincy Jones. Her 50 years in the music industry recently culminated in a long overdue 2023 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

The moment guitarist Rob Bacon opened the set on the talk box, with bassist Melvin Davis and drummer Jay Williams laying down the beat, it was clear we were about to get a lesson in some naaaasty funk with “Tell Me Something Good.” If the way our in-office audience was jamming to “What Cha’ Gonna Do For Me,” and “Ain’t Nobody” is any indication, be prepared to watch this show in a location where you can comfortably groove. “Sweet Thing” showcased vocalist Tiffany Smith killing the most iconic (and most vocally difficult) moment in the song, something that has humbled many a singer.

And what better way to close out this Tiny Desk during a month celebrating the contributions of Black women in music than with the anthem that has empowered woman-identified audiences for decades: the Nickolas Ashford and Valerie Simpson penned “I’m Every Woman.”Throughout the set, I’m reminded that Khan’s unfathomably big and powerful voice is a glue that holds intergenerational music together.

uRG6IWYVazM,Tierra Whack: Tiny Desk Concert,"This Black Music Month, Tiny Desk is giving the ladies their flowers. We’re releasing nine Tiny Desk concerts from Black women artists, from veterans who’ve paved the way for what we hear today in Black music, to those who are carving out their own paths.

Before we start, a warning, this concert includes a song about suicide.

Ashley Pointer | June 7, 2024
Tierra Whack and her band she dubbed ""The Big Backs"" might go down as having one of the best Tiny Desks in history. Why? Whack manages to keep all of us on our toes, pulling endless tricks out of her bag.

Her Tiny Desk performance gave playful, grade school shenanigans: Whack wielding a giant Ticonderoga No. 2 pencil, the band throwing balls of paper at each other, Whack tossing paper airplanes into the audience and a super special appearance by the Phillie Phanatic. “Y’all know I gotta keep it Philly. I bleed green. I bleed red. Anything Philly is all me. I had to bring a piece of home with me,” Whack says after inviting the Philadelphia Phillies mascot behind the Desk for “MOOVIES.” 

Whack has been an invigorating presence in music since releasing her debut mixtape Whack World in 2018. At the Desk, she performs fresh arrangements of the biggest cuts from that album — “Flea Market,” “Pretty Ugly” and “Hungry Hippo” — before traversing an array of songs from her newest release WORLD WIDE WHACK. Whack and her bandmates are so locked in, it’s hard to believe that this performance is her first time fronting a live band. Aside from the tasteful arrangements, creativity and synergy, I especially love how each person behind the Desk lets their inner kid out to play.

If you or someone you know may be considering suicide or is in crisis, contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by dialing 9-8-8, or the Crisis Text Line by texting HOME to 741741.

wrm0cN7bTOM,Lakecia Benjamin: Tiny Desk Concert,"This Black Music Month, Tiny Desk is giving the ladies their flowers. We’re releasing nine Tiny Desk concerts from Black women artists, from veterans who’ve paved the way for what we hear today in Black music, to those who are carving out their own paths.

Nikki Birch | June 5, 2024
Alto saxophonist Lakecia Benjamin burst into her Tiny Desk Concert like a meteor breaching the atmosphere.

Benjamin approaches her music and performances with a take-no-prisoners attitude. After primarily performing as an accompanist, she introduced the world to her own voice. While her first two studio albums leaned into jazz-funk and soul, in 2020 she referenced her bebop and spiritual influences with Pursuance: The Coltranes, an album that brought together several generations of the genre’s luminaries to pay homage to John and Alice Coltrane. That project and her 2023 album, Phoenix, received critical acclaim, the latter earning her three Grammy nominations.

Her opening tune, “Phoenix Reimagined” is a joyous explosion that ushers you into her world, whether you’re ready or not. Her next two songs put her lyricism front and center, as she welcomed singer Melodie Ray to sing with her on “Let Go,” a song that follows the steps of jazz poetry and hip-hop, and “Mercy.” Benjamin concluded her performance with “Trane,” a song she wrote to honor the Coltranes.

Because we are celebrating Black Music Month by giving our all-women lineup their flowers, I asked Benjamin to talk about some of the women who continue to inspire her. She named a few of her mentors: Terri Lyne Carrington, Patrice Rushen and Dee Dee Bridgewater, all of whom are trailblazers in and out of Black music. I couldn’t help but think of them when she joyfully declared: “We here!”

Bobby Carter | June 3, 2024
To hear Tems tell the audience that she was shy came as a surprise to me. As a performer, she captivates us with such ease and exudes confidence when she’s not, so to see her blushing as the crowd roared was sweet to witness. Unlike most artists who’ve performed at the Desk, the Nigerian singer-songwriter took a chance by playing a set filled with songs from her forthcoming debut album, Born in the Wild.

A lot has happened in Tems’ world since her Tiny Desk (home) concert a couple of years ago. She’s won dozens of awards including a Grammy, worked with Beyoncé and written for Rihanna, all of which helped to keep her name on our minds and music in the clubs. These new songs indicate time well spent between her breakout moment a few years ago and now. “Unfortunate” is less Afrobeats and more straightforward R&B, flexing her development as a writer. “Forever” is powerful in the way she reaches a vocal range I had no idea she could, while “Love Me JeJe” was the hands-down standout. At the time of the taping, the song had yet to be released, but the rhythm pierced the room and had us all in line for the call and response.

XyHkoKwPtaw,Sean Paul: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | May 31, 2024
The vibrancy that bounces off the screen while watching Sean Paul’s Tiny Desk concert is undeniable. Hearing his voice just a few feet away was an overwhelming experience, and I overheard a few NPR staffers in attendance who agreed. “He sounds just like the record!” they said, moving like nobody was watching. Admittedly, we don’t host enough dancehall artists at the Tiny Desk so there was an element of surprise at play. But the Jamaican superstar’s catalog boasts some of the world's biggest party anthems; it should've been a no-brainer when working with that. “This ain’t no Tiny Desk no more,” Paul said as he strutted to the Desk, preparing to turn the office into a bashment party.

Paul took reggae and dancehall to new heights in the early 2000s. After hopping on any and every riddim for the clubs and dropping his debut, Stage One, the breakthrough came with his second album, Dutty Rock, in 2002. The global reach of that album shifted the music industry and everyone from the biggest pop star to the grimiest emcee needed the Sean Paul effect on their albums. For his set, the game plan was simple, all gas and no breaks; energetic hit after hit including “Gimme the Light”, “Get Busy,” “Like Glue” and topping things off with “Temperature.”

sKHswNFsRww,"The Philharmonik, 2024 Tiny Desk Contest Winner: Tiny Desk Concert","Elle Mannion | May 29, 2024
While each Tiny Desk concert is special in its own way, we only publish one annually from a Tiny Desk Contest winner. This year, that winner is The Philharmonik —  an up-and-coming multi-genre artist from Sacramento, Calif. — whose entry rose to the top of nearly 7,000 entries submitted by independent artists. 

In that entry, singer Christian Gates and his band proved they knew how to make a song shine behind a desk, performing in an office setting in business casual attire. They keep up the act at the Tiny Desk, with Gates cosplaying as the team’s boss; he showcases his expressive stage presence and expansive musical range all while sitting in a swiveling office chair.

The group kicks off its celebratory set with its winning song, “What’s It All Mean?” Then, Gates shifts to the upright piano to perform “Drugs,” a theatrical song he says “is for all of those who have thought about doing alternative things because the paycheck was not enough.” He returns to the keyboard for “Chasing…” before flexing his rap abilities on “Colors.” The Philharmonik closes with the catchy “Pay Me,” a song I’m sure plenty of disgruntled workers will want to sing to their bosses after watching this concert.

Although Gates’ life has changed overnight since winning the Contest, he stays humble throughout his set, continually crediting his team’s hard work. “This office is a group effort, and this is just another day at the office,” he says.

MMS4JAy9z0Y,Bob James: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | May 27, 2024
Bob James' Tiny Desk concert is a manifestation of freedom and collaboration. ""I have youth represented here,"" he says before introducing his band. ""I don't have that myself, but I can hire it."" The joke is tinged with a certain degree of truth. Still, curiosity and openness fuel his fresh spirit and keep his fanbase wide-ranging. The jazz pianist, composer and producer took his opportunity at the Desk to highlight his iconic discography, spanning over five decades.

Quincy Jones discovered Bob James in the 1960s and signed him to a record deal. He then arranged for other jazz greats like Sarah Vaughan and Grover Washington Jr. before releasing his album One in 1974. That album featured ""Feel Like Making Love"" and ""Nautilus,"" one of the most sampled records in hip-hop. While James has released dozens of projects with his contemporaries, hip-hop has been the bridge to younger generations.

Before the new, improvised version of ""Nautilus"" with DJ Jazzy Jeff and Talib Kweli — seriously, they mapped it out and tried it once before we hit record — James played other highlights from his catalog including ""Westchester Lady,"" ""Angela (Theme from Taxi),"" and ""The Secret Drawer"" from his Grammy-nominated album, Jazz Hands.

y-PLr-BPxKU,Nelly Furtado: Tiny Desk Concert,"Stephen Thompson | May 24, 2024
Nelly Furtado’s career has spanned a quarter-century, not to mention tens of millions of records sold, so it’s tough to fit all the highlights into a single Tiny Desk concert. But damned if Furtado didn’t at least try: Her set featured a bunch of her biggest hits (“Promiscuous,” “Say It Right,” “I’m Like A Bird,” “Maneater”), her remix of Missy Elliott’s “Get Ur Freak On” and, yes, a brand-new single called “Love Bites.” In all, 11 tracks — some of them complete, some of them truncated into medleys — made the cut.

For this set, Furtado assembled eight of her favorite veteran collaborators, who joined her in organically re-creating her busy, glitchy pop sound without relying on backing tracks. That meant incorporating everything from a violin to cowbell to beatboxing to scratching courtesy of DJ Lil Jaz — Furtado and Lil Jaz have a daughter together, Nevis, who served as the set’s creative director — in a performance that felt like a victory lap, a greatest-hits reel and a homecoming all at once.

SET LIST
“Say It Right”
“Explode”
“Powerless (Say What You Want)”
“Promiscuous”

LNFfrhXxJDQ,The Staves: Tiny Desk Concert,"Kara Frame | May 23, 2024
When we last heard from The Staves, its members were in the kitchen of their Watford, England childhood home. Sourdough was on the table and sunlight streamed through the curtains as the folk-pop group's sisterly harmonies and banter made their Tiny Desk (home) concert feel familiar and approachable. Three years later, The Staves finally made it to the NPR Music office.

What was founded as a sister trio is now a sister duo — Emily Stavely-Taylor, the eldest, is taking time away from the band to focus on her family. The Staves' new album, All Now, reflects that change; on record and in this performance, Jessica and Camilla Staveley-Taylor quiet any qualms that they would be able to carry on the harmonies for which the group is known. Instead, the Tiny Desk setting perfectly illuminates the power and talent of their voices.

5G6q__7jQoU,Ana Tijoux: Tiny Desk Concert,"Anamaria Sayre | May 22, 2024
In the transfixing world of Ana Tijoux, joy and protest are perennial lovers. For three decades, the French-born Chilean rapper has traveled around the world, offering refuge for those seeking ways to sing of their outrage and heartbreak. At the Tiny Desk, she does the same, featuring tracks from across her catalog rich with cultural commentary and political critique.

Her first album in 10 years, Vida, teems with life. Blending danceable beats with her typical cutting delivery, she invites the listener to find her back where she started — living for the love of music and dancing for the love of life.

To close this performance, she conjures an enduring spirit of protest. During ""Vida,"" featuring guest vocalist Monica Blaire, Tijoux quotes a song by Víctor Jara: ""Yo no canto por cantar / Ni por tener buena voz / Canto porque la guitarra / Tiene sentido y razón."" The Chilean musician and activist was arrested, tortured and murdered by the military during the coup led by dictator Augusto Pinochet in 1973; Jara's song ""Manifiesto"" was released posthumously in 1974. Translated, Tijoux raps, ""I don't sing for the sake of singing / Or for having a good voice / I sing because the guitar / Has sense and reason.""

hdMcKy93AZk,Gary Bartz: Tiny Desk Concert,"Mitra I. Arthur | May 20, 2024
The lyrics ""Music is my sanctuary, music is my life,"" hold special meaning at the Tiny Desk. Penned and sung by 2024 National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master, saxophonist Gary Bartz, the words capture the feelings of countless artists who have appeared in front of these cluttered shelves. Bartz has worked with jazz luminaries like Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers, Max Roach, Miles Davis and Charles Mingus, to name a few. He has released more than 45 solo albums, with appearances on more than 200 additional albums. His recent collaborations with Ali Shaheed Muhammad and Adrian Younge for their Jazz is Dead series illustrate how the 83-year-old is still as relevant as ever.

In a recent interview, Bartz declared that ""Music, for me, is the only religion."" He sets the stage for his worship with the bluesy ""Nommo - The Majick Song,"" as Mumu Fresh's accompanying poetry invokes the spirit necessary for both delivering and receiving the band's message. 1973's ""I've Known Rivers,"" inspired by Langston Hughes, furthers the ancestral connection in both text and sound. On ""Reparations,"" poet J. Ivy provides excerpts from his 2022 track ""Lay Down'' to reflect on the debt America owes descendants of enslaved people. And as Bartz delivers a benediction in the form of ""The Song of Loving-Kindness,"" declaring it ""written for everyone and everything that ever was,"" it feels like a blessing on the Tiny Desk.

49zIojl1CM4,Luciana Souza: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | May 17, 2024
I’m not the first to say it: jazz and Brazilian music are like very close first cousins. There is a historical DNA connecting the two traditions, but also linked by harmonic construction, ample room for improvisation and plain old swing.

In Luciana Souza’s performance, all of the above is on display in the music from one of the most distinct voices in contemporary jazz. Backed by Trio Corrente from Brazil, Souza performs selections from their album Cometa, which received a 2024 Grammy nomination for best Latin jazz album. Souza’s performance is a master class in how to play with intensity while keeping the volume down to accommodate the Tiny Desk’s actual workspace.

tajoGudOj70,Yasser Tejeda: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | May 15, 2024
To listen to Yasser Tejeda's music is to hear the past, present and future.

He is a gifted guitar player originally from the Dominican Republic and a graduate of the acclaimed Berklee College of Music. As you can see and hear in his turn behind the Tiny Desk, Tejeda is intentional about drawing on his ancestral background, his studies and his musical vision in his work. He deftly combines traditional Dominican music with jazz and rock in performances that move the hips as well as minds.

According to his notes prepared for this performance, ""En El Naranjo"" and ""Amor Congo"" are based on a traditional Dominican rhythm called ""congos del espiritu de santo de Villa Mella."" ""La Vereda"" is a fusion of a traditional style called ""Sarandunga de Baní"" with rock and jazz, while ""Todo Va A Marchar"" is his exploration of Congolese guitar and kompa from Haiti mixed with Dominican merengue.

There will not be a quiz given after you watch this performance, but the music of Yasser Tejeda and his talented band resonates so much more when you consider the history behind the passion of the performances.

asZZrUFeM_8,Kiefer: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | May 13, 2024
For Tiny Desk concerts without a lead vocalist, I usually try to detect musicians' nonverbal conversations with each other as they perform. For Kiefer’s set, there’s a bonus show within the show. He plays with a sense of joy that I haven’t seen in a while and when his eyes connect with a fellow player, it’s as if he’s thanking them each time. With decades clocked behind the piano and a strong catalog, Kiefer Shackelford is primed for the moment. 

The Los Angeles pianist and producer’s early instrumental projects were heavily hip-hop-based, playing the keys over drum loops and samples. His 2021 project, When There’s Love Around, leaped into full-on jazz, but his latest, It’s Ok, B U, finds that sweet middle ground. Between albums, he’s made a name for himself in the independent scene and among the majors, booking work with Drake, Anderson .Paak and SiR. For his Tiny Desk, Kiefer brought two ensembles to highlight the best of his work. The Kiefer Trio, comprised of drummer Luke Titus and bassist Pera Krstajic, played a medley of “Why Not?” and “Cute.” For “Superhero” and “Socially Awkward,” Kiefer then invited Nate Smith, Carrtoons, Theo Croker and guitarist Charlie Hunter who, shockingly, is the only musician in this combo who hasn’t played at the Desk.

wIfg-Ye0FVk,Otoboke Beaver: Tiny Desk Concert,"Lars Gotrich | May 10, 2024
Mannie Fresh bum rushed the crowd and mugged for the camera. Soul Glo's Pierce Jordan stunted on office furniture. Moses Sumney played our window-side piano. Some moments were staged and others spontaneous, but sometimes an artist just needs to ""break the frame"" of Tiny Desk. Case in point: Our puny shelves and cluttered junk could not contain Otoboke Beaver's Yoyoyoshie, who literally lept out from behind the Desk, ran to the wide shot and shred a noisy guitar solo most triumphantly.

Kyoto, Japan's Otoboke Beaver came into the NPR Music office with string lights color coordinated to the members' floral print dresses, an edamame hair clip for our wall and a giant, inflatable beaver. In two-minute bursts of fast, furious and outrageously fun punk rock, the band's music is a gleeful exercise in absurdist evisceration — of Japanese societal norms, gender roles, annoying trolls and bad boyfriends. Every song smirks as it explodes. At the Tiny Desk, Otoboke Beaver speeds and screams through its catalog — Itekoma Hits, Super Champon and its singles compilation Okoshiyasu!! — with acrobatic speed and intensity. An unhinged delight.

z2nGMDs65tI,Marty Stuart and His Fabulous Superlatives: Tiny Desk Concert,"Suraya Mohamed | May 6, 2024
When Marty Stuart arrived, his cheerful smile and charismatic personality beamed. He had a charming swagger and it was immediately clear we were in the presence of a country and bluegrass music legend.

When Stuart was just 12 years old, he went on the road for the first time with a Pentecostal gospel bluegrass group called the Sullivan Family Gospel Singers. Almost 55 years later, he’s still performing and is a five-time Grammy winner, Country Music Hall of Famer and AMA Lifetime Achievement Award recipient.

Those accolades only hint at the artistry of Mary Stuart and his longtime band The Fabulous Superlatives. Looking around the room during his Tiny Desk performance, people in the audience were visibly captivated by this undeniable demonstration of musical excellence — beautiful harmonies, precise rhythmic precision and perfectly blended arrangements all sewn together with a casual flair that was simple and fun. 

Recorded just a few days before Easter, the set ends appropriately in the spirit of the church. “When we first put our band together, the way we learned to sing together was singing gospel songs,” said Stuart. “I was in love with the Staple Singers as always, Mavis and Pops and Cleotha and Pervis, and they are all like family and so bluegrass music all figured in. So we finally got around to writing a few songs for ourselves and here’s one we got to do called ‘Heaven.’ ”

DmC2QQESN6E,WILLOW: Tiny Desk Concert,"Ashley Pointer | May 1, 2024
On a call ahead of her Tiny Desk taping, WILLOW told me that she ""just wants to feel it and be in the vibe."" Many artists worry about having to tailor their music for the space, but if done right, a beautiful synergy can be achieved. With boundless energy and magnetic stage presence, the artist's exceptional vocal range and musicality left the audience spellbound.

Despite being only 23 years old, the singer-songwriter and musician Willow Smith is a vet when it comes to this music thing. She's been consistently making music and on a journey of sonic exploration since she was just 9 years old and is about to put out her sixth album, empathogen, in just a few days. Zach Tenorio on upright piano kicks off the show, cueing the first few bars of the jazz-infused, odd-meter vibes of ""Symptom of Life"" from the new album, later complimented by trippy Ebow effects courtesy of Liso Lee on guitar.

Then, a couple throwbacks: a stripped down arrangement of ""Split"" from the 2022 album and fan-favorite ""Wait a Minute!"" from her 2015 album ARDIPITHECUS, which undergoes some mind-blowing bass riffing from Mohini Dey. Dey continues with some severe stank-face on a world premiere of the funky, bass-heavy ""Run!"" from the upcoming album, locking in tastefully with The Pocket Queen on drums. Closing the set with ""Big Feelings,"" the band gets busy while WILLOW's vocals soar, effortlessly teetering between emotive highs and lows, leaving us all wanting more.

pHWum1ptOxs,Hot Chip: Tiny Desk Concert,"Maia Stern | April 29, 2024
Even though it was the band's first visit to the Tiny Desk, Hot Chip's performance felt like a homecoming — a sweet return to some of the instruments the group first created its signature, playful sound with. Hot Chip's ""tiny instruments,"" as lead vocalist Alexis Taylor called them, fit right into the space.

The members of Hot Chip arrived at NPR HQ each dressed in a different colored top, their bright and brilliant looks matching the music's classic electro-pop vibe. The band, joined by Jonny Lam on pedal steel guitar (who played a Tiny Desk previously with Sinkane) began the set with two tracks from its 2006 album The Warning, including ""Over and Over"" and ""Boy From School."" The latter of the two, Taylor explained, was written on the Casio keyboard that both Taylor and guitarist Rob Smoughton play in this set. Then the band slows it down a bit with ""Look At Where We Are,"" before ending with the classic ""Ready For The Floor.""

And speaking of bringing the perfect look, after the show, Taylor got out an on-theme top: an NPR branded sweatshirt that he asked us all to sign. It was a rare, tender and probably once-in-a-lifetime moment, when one of your favorite bands is asking you to sign merch.

TR2hG7ke2YQ,Lise Davidsen: Tiny Desk Concert,"Tom Huizenga | April 26, 2024

I knew we were in for something spectacular when the Norwegian soprano Lise Davidsen came to our Tiny Desk — especially when she could be heard, loud and clear, from far down the hall, warming up in our green room. Once she got to the Desk itself, to rehearse with pianist and Metropolitan Opera assistant conductor Bryan Wagorn, the sublime amplitude of her extraordinary voice rendered the space even tinier.
Davidsen’s voice, which is incongruously gigantic and intimate, has been called “one-in-a-million.” I was completely sold on the hype after only a few seconds of singing. A couple of us reached for tissues to wipe away tears of disbelief. The voice gleams like pure polished silver, powerful enough to surge past massive orchestras and yet capable of paring down to a single silvery strand of tone, perfectly supported to reach the rafters.

It’s all the more remarkable since Davidsen was already in her 20s before she saw an opera for the first time. Her warp-speed rise has taken her from a small town in Norway, where she played handball and strummed her guitar, to starring roles at the world’s finest stages.

She begins her set with Desdemona’s quiet supplication from Verdi’s Otello. It’s a prayer for the troubles of the world today, she explains. A moody song of unrequited love by her compatriot Edvard Grieg follows. And, saving the money notes for last, Davidsen closes with a rambunctious czardas from Die Csárdásfürstin. Notice the subtlety of phrasing when she extends the word “Heimatland” beautifully in the opening verse. She caps the aria with an electrifying high C. The audience, appropriately, goes nuts. 

With a little luck and scrupulous care for her voice, Davidsen, only 37, is poised for a career we will be talking about for decades to come.

vR6_ZVKEhJ4,Ne-Yo: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | April 26, 2024
There's nothing like hearing the oohs and aahs from the Tiny Desk audience when a recognizable note hits the soul. Ne-Yo's setlist stoked up audible gasps with nonstop hits from his catalog and a few he's written for megastars. He came draped in a bedazzled outfit and his signature fedora (one we had to ask him to adjust to see his eyes.) Not to be outdone, the band came outfitted in matching earth tones and sounded just as good as they looked.

As with most artists who've spent years on the radio, the charts and in the club, the challenge in our space is encapsulating those moments. He accepted this challenge by putting together a medley of some of his most celebrated jams, showing off just how prolific his pen is. ""I've written a couple songs since I've been doing this thang,"" the singer said before passing Rihanna's ""Take a Bow"" to background singer, Pamela Westbrook. Before the premiere of his ""confessional,"" the song ""Two Million Secrets,"" the singer reminded us that he also wrote Beyoncé's ""Irreplaceable"" and co-wrote Mario's ""Let Me Love You."" He shared with us that there was a healthy dose of nerves during his set, but — forever the showman — Ne-Yo gave the ladies what they came for closing with ""Miss Independent.""

qVh79v4nICo,Hauschka: Tiny Desk Concert,"Robin Hilton | April 24, 2024
The last time Volker Bertelmann stopped by NPR to perform as Hauschka, back in 2010, he dumped handfuls of Ping-Pong balls and anything else he could think of over the strings of our in-house grand piano, a performance captured in one of NPR's pristine studios (in a building that no longer exists). But for the Tiny Desk, the pianist and composer assumed the challenge of preparing our significantly smaller upright in a much-less-controlled environment.

It's hard to spot everything Hauschka deployed for this mostly improvised set, but after dismantling much of the piano's cabinet, he stuffed the strings with tin foil, a glob of pink putty, cellophane, piano tuner mutes, sleigh bells, gaffers tape and whatever else he could rummage from a large bag of toys he carries with him.

Hauschka is joined by cellists Carol Anne Bosco and Devree Lewis who, since the set was mostly improvised, were told to simply come on ""about 10 minutes"" into his performance. Note that the songs are named for the location they were performed, in this case ""Washington,"" and numbered. The closing cut, ""Loved Ones,"" is from his latest album, Philanthropy.

Bertelmann's performance at the Tiny Desk comes just over a year after winning an Oscar for his score to the film All Quiet On The Western Front.

bEyxy8S1MN8,Sleater-Kinney: Tiny Desk Concert,"Stephen Thompson | April 22, 2024
For a roughly three-year stretch beginning in late 2007, Sleater-Kinney's Carrie Brownstein reached the pinnacle of a career that has included stints as a rock star, a TV actor and an author. During that time, Brownstein wrote the NPR Music blog Monitor Mix and appeared as a frequent panelist on All Songs Considered. But she foolishly climbed down from that mountaintop in 2010 in order to launch the TV show Portlandia and the band Wild Flag, among other dalliances.

Last month, she finally came crawling back to NPR. On the heels of Sleater-Kinney's 11th studio album, Little Rope, the band convened at the Tiny Desk to perform two songs from the new record, as well as a pair of songs from 2005's The Woods. Thanks in part to a terrific string quartet — whom the band had just met in what Corin Tucker described as a ""blind date"" — the Little Rope tracks benefited from a fresh sense of sweep. And the whole show doubled as an exercise in careful balance, as old songs coexisted with new ones, Brownstein swapped the vocal spotlight with powerhouse singer Tucker, and intensity met restraint.

Behind the scenes, the band's presence triggered a kind of impromptu family reunion, as Bob Boilen took a momentary break from retirement to show up and cheer on his former colleague. But on camera, Sleater-Kinney was all business — as wiry and vital as ever. It's too bad for everyone involved that Brownstein no longer works for NPR, but this performance felt like far and away the next best thing.

ZYRwNwwFCSk,Yaya Bey: Tiny Desk Concert,"Ashley Pointer | April 17, 2024
Throughout an emotional, soul-stirring set, the multitudes of Yaya Bey's music and artistry are on full display in her Tiny Desk concert. The New York-bred singer-songwriter opens the show by paying homage to her Barbados roots: reggae-tinged grooves of ""meet me in brooklyn"" from her powerful 2022 album, Remember Your North Star, that flow seamlessly into ""on the pisces moon"" from 2023's Exodus The North Star.

Our little corner can be a space for artists and musicians to approach their music in more intimate ways, often leading to incredibly raw experiences. Bey manages to create a sense of closeness with the audience as she emphatically expresses how difficult this performance is for her to get through: ""My dad died last year, so I be spacing out sometimes when I do this joint,"" before diving into the sentimental ""reprise.""

Before closing the set with ""me and all my n*****,"" a new song from her upcoming LP Ten Fold, which she says she wrote as ""an ode to human resilience,"" she continues to open up about her battle with long COVID: ""That mask s*** is real; [this] s*** is hard."" Bey's performance feels like peeking into her personal journals, and it's truly healing to experience. Not a dry eye was left in the building.

RyWGBoU6dc8,Linda May Han Oh: Tiny Desk Concert,"Mitra I. Arthur | April 15, 2024
Themes of reflection and resilience are on display the moment bassist Linda May Han Oh begins her opener, ""Halo,"" a driving tune dedicated to the world of live music producers. The track, accentuated by Greg Ward on alto saxophone and Fabian Almazan's use of an effects pedal on the piano, calls to mind the grind and hustle of playing and presenting gigs. Performance of thoughtful and complex sounds is at the heart of jazz, and at the heart of Oh's impact as a composer and musician. Her work with artists like Pat Metheny, Terri Lyne Carrington and Vijay Iyer, plus her projects as a composer and bandleader (including a chamber jazz ensemble and album, Aventurine) have culminated in Oh being an in-demand jazz bassist.

In this Tiny Desk, Oh presents a mix of cuts from her 2023 release, The Glass Hours, and new works. Her theme of resilience is exemplified in ""The Imperative,"" where drummer Mark Whitfield Jr. and tenor saxophonist Mark Turner shine. ""Rise Mountains"" is a conversation between the married duo of Oh and Almazan — at times a unified conversation, in others one where each takes a side. To close her set, Oh moves from upright bass to an electric for ""Hatchling,"" inspired by her and Almazan's 3-year-old son. This whimsical song, with Oh and Sara Serpa vocalizing, paints a portrait of a tiny human discovering life and exploring a new world.

rGyQHyDMZZI,Fujii Kaze: Tiny Desk Concerts JAPAN,"Suraya Mohamed | April 12, 2024
In the corner of a busy office at the NHK Broadcasting Center in Shibuya, Tokyo, a staffer rearranged books, vinyl records and tchotchkes on a bright red shelving unit. The production crew double-checked equipment settings and made small adjustments to the lighting. Another worker added a few more posters to the tall white file cabinets. Cameras were set and microphones were ready because Fujii Kaze and his band had just rehearsed the night before. Everyone in the room — including a few of us from NPR that were there to help — was eager and excited because the very first performance for Tiny Desk Concerts JAPAN was about to start.

Popular around the world, the talented Fujii Kaze is a Japanese singer and pianist known for his sultry R&B grooves and catchy songwriting. His adventurous spirit was strong as he settled into the Tiny Desk way — a concert that's intimate, mostly acoustic and recorded without reverb, effects, in-ear monitors or wedges. During the rehearsal, the band quickly acclimated to the environment and adjusted instrument volumes to hear each other better. The end result was a beautiful 30 minute set, captured without pause and with no stops, restarts or retakes.

This video is part of the second international version of Tiny Desk, a joint venture between NPR and The Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) — the sole public media organization in Japan that is operated with the purpose of providing the latest news, education and culture both domestically and internationally. This new series will spotlight emerging and established Japanese artists with the same engaged performances, look and feel of the original Tiny Desk Concerts series.

R2_7ADO2Hlo,El Laberinto del Coco: Tiny Desk x globalFEST,"In 2021, the Tiny Desk x globalFEST series was created to promote international music discovery.

Felix Contreras | April 5, 2024
The island of Puerto Rico has become known for various musical styles that have influenced not just Latin music, but also global musical trends. From the Afro Caribbean styles that make up the salsa boom of the 1970s, to the ""BOOM-chicka-BOOM"" of the reggaeton beat that came to dominate the charts, Puerto Rican musicians innovate while never straying far from tradition.

That idea inspired percussionist Hector ""Coco"" Barez to create the group El Laberinto del Coco, a genre-bending collective built around the folklore and rhythmic styles of bomba. The group's message is clear from the opening grooves of ""Se Vuelve Miel"" that Barez's vision is to dig deep into the African roots of call-and-response with four vocalists and four horn players to remind us throughout its performance of the power of bomba to create community.

Special mention should be made of the presence of musician Jerry Medina, a musical treasure and icon from the island who has performed with the biggest names in Afro Caribbean music as a vocalist and trumpeter — in this case adding voca rumba percussion and sound effects.

Felix Contreras | April 3, 2024
The first impression I get from watching the Spanish duo Tarta Relena at the Tiny Desk is a reminder that the human voice may be mankind's oldest musical instrument.

Even more so when you consider that the five languages they sing here includes not just Spanish, Greek and their native Catalan, but also Latin and classical Greek, evoking images of lyricists and vocalists from centuries past.

Starting initially as an a capella project in 2016, vocalists Helena Ros and Marta Torella eventually added ambient-styled electronics to cushion their uncommonly matched voices. The duo's first number, ""Me Yelassan,"" is in Greek, so be sure to activate the translation option on the video to fully appreciate the power of the performance with lyrics read almost like a Zen koan meditation on rebirth and eternity.

Stay tuned in to those translations, because the magic of this performance is in losing yourself in the harmonies and timeless poetic lyrics. In fact, the lyrics of the song ""Safo"" are taken from a poem written by the ancient Greek poet Sappho, and includes the prophetic line: ""Someone will remember us, I say even in another time."" How often do we get a chance to consider our place in history set to such stunning vocals?

Suraya Mohamed | April 1, 2024
Thandiswa Mazwai is one of post-apartheid South Africa's most influential musicians. For nearly 30 years she has championed a kind of dance music called Kwaito. The South African genre mixes a variety of rhythms and influences including hip-hop, reggae, jazz and house music. 

This phenomenal set starts with “Nizalwa Ngobani?”, translated from the Xhosa language for “Do you know where you come from?” It’s dedicated to the ever-resilient people of South Africa. “I want to say to my people at home, thank you,” she says. “I am known worldwide because of you.” After, she sings a love song, “Ingoma” with the memorable hook “Ngoma we, ngoma we, ngoma we,” which loosely translates to “You are a song that I never get tired of.” 

She dedicates the next song, “Children of the Soil,” to all the people around the world who find themselves struggling for freedom. “This is our time to use our voices,” she affirms. “This is the time for us to fight for freedom, wherever it is in the world.” “Children of the Soil” will be featured on her soon-to-be-released new album, Sankofa. And she finishes this set with the powerful “Abenguni,” and the catchy upbeat tune “Lahl’umlenze,” with its resilient hook: “Why does it matter how I dance?”

uA5hf_94Ffc,Soul Glo: Tiny Desk Concert,"Lars Gotrich | March 29, 2024
We have hosted rap legends, Broadway musicals, pop stars, world-renowned classical musicians, indie rockers and folkies — there's a universe of music at the Tiny Desk that keeps expanding. But we have never featured a hardcore punk band at the NPR Music office ... until Soul Glo.

Hardcore and punk are vital not only in how I understand the world but also challenge myself; it's music that feels first, then screams. Soul Glo crystalizes its anger and anxiety — about trauma, anti-Blackness, mortality, survival — with a pummeling prism of classic hardcore speed, psychedelic noise, sludgy riffs and a spitfire vocalist with exasperated-but-exhilarating run-ons, who finds moments to step back and bounce like an emcee would.

But punk can also be unpredictable because, at its heart, punk does not want to be contained. Soul Glo's set features tracks from 2022's still thrilling Diaspora Problems, plus a loosie from last year. Halfway through ""Driponomics,"" Pierce Jordan gets on the Desk, but dips in and out of the microphone's range to commune with the throng of punks gathered. The same happens with the band's outrageously chaotic and catchy closer ""Gold Chain Punk (whogonbeatmyass?),"" but what the mics don't capture in Jordan's verse, the crowd more than ably makes up for in the gang vocals that feverishly scream back the hook. (Yes, that is me stepping into the frame to get a mic back in Jordan's general vicinity.) Oh, and in a Tiny Desk of several firsts, a mosh pit broke out in the office; I'm still smiling about it.

""Jump!! (Or Get Jumped!!!)((by the future))""'

-n4BR0vUB80,Víkingur Ólafsson: Tiny Desk Concert,"Tom Huizenga | March 28, 2024
Top-tier concert pianists commonly perform on nine-foot grand pianos. However, when they visit the Tiny Desk, it's our job to convince them to scale down to our diminutive upright. We got no argument from Víkingur Ólafsson, the 40-year-old star pianist from Iceland.

His eyes lit up when he saw our instrument. He immediately removed its upper panel, then secured the practice pedal, which drops a curtain of felt between the hammers and the strings, producing a muted, intimate sound, allowing the music to be practically whispered to us.

The pieces Ólafsson chooses are gentle, and for him nostalgic, recalling the countless hours spent at his own upright piano in his childhood bedroom.

J.S. Bach's Goldberg Variations is ""an encyclopedia of how you can think and dream on the keyboard,"" Ólafsson says, after opening with the work's featherlight Aria and vigorous first variation. His phrasing is warm and lilting, and as detailed as a Vermeer.

Ólafsson is also a gifted arranger. His rendition of an interlude from Jean-Philippe Rameau's 1763 opera Les Boréades unspools as a calm procession. Ólafsson titled it ""The Arts and the Hours"" because, he says, ""art is long and life is short.""

Filtered through Béla Bartók, Three Hungarian Folksongs from Csík have been part of Ólafsson's repertoire since childhood. The wistful melodies and tangy harmonies are irresistible. And Ólafsson closes with another personal arrangement, ""Ave María,"" something close to Iceland's national prayer.

The pianist insisted on placing our grumpy-looking Bach bobblehead on the piano for companionship, joking that the frowning little toy ""seems permanently displeased with everything I do."" But judging from this performance, and his wise words, Ólafsson is doing everything just right.

SET LIST
J.S. Bach: Goldberg Variations - Aria, Variation No. 1
Jean-Philipe Rameau (arr. Ólafsson): ""The Arts and the Hours""
Béla Bartók: Three Hungarian Folksongs from Csík

tPgSPOykA0M,Big Sean: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | March 27, 2024
Most artists who play the Tiny Desk leave behind a small memento to live on the shelves. Big Sean gave us his special Detroit Tigers/J Dilla baseball cap, an item that speaks to who he is as an artist. Sean doesn't allow too much time to pass without reminding you of his native Detroit and his most recent freestyle samples an instrumental from the late great J Dilla. Sean pushed our boundaries, presenting one of the longest setlists in Tiny Desk history, but was also extremely gracious and collaborative with our team. This wasn't just another appearance for him. ""It's something my kids can look back on, something my family can look back on to see where I was at in my career,"" he said before closing with the rambunctious ""I Don't F*** With You.""

Sean Anderson's journey from a high-pitched kid pining for the attention of Ye to one of the most respected lyricists and hitmakers in hip-hop is cleverly packed into this Tiny Desk concert. One of my favorite moments was when he touched on his background as a blog-era emcee. Most of the current kings and queens of hip-hop came up in the same era and it's hard to fathom what the culture would be without that class. Every word and song of his performance was deliberate: from ""Memories,"" right up to the world premiere of ""On Up,"" a song dedicated to his son, Noah, with whom he shares with singer Jhené Aiko, who also gets a bit of shine during his set.

w4WiXKGCJhg,Chappell Roan: Tiny Desk Concert,"Stephen Thompson | March 21, 2024
It’s become a Tiny Desk tradition for artists to leave a small offering on the shelves — a tchotchke, a toy, a signed album or piece of swag, a guitar pick, that sort of thing. Usually, those pieces get absorbed into the visual din, but sometimes, they change the look of the Tiny Desk permanently. All of which is to say that when Chappell Roan finished her magnetic performance, we immediately sought her out to sheepishly ask if we could keep her wig.

Roan’s marvelous debut album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, came out last September — just in time to fit into the window of eligibility for the 2025 Grammys, hint hint wink — and it finds the singer toying confidently with a persona inspired in part by drag performers. Flanked by a pink-clad band, she wasn’t about to pass up the opportunity to serve up an absolute look, complete with white makeup and a towering wig (bolstered by a wadded-up trash bag tucked inside, as well as an assortment of stubbed-out cigarette butts), which now sits comfortably atop a skull Cypress Hill left us.

It’s only appropriate that Roan would forever alter the Tiny Desk. Because, at the risk of sounding hyperbolic, this is a stunning set: Performing five songs from Midwest Princess, Roan worked through songs of youthful heartache (“Casual”), queer liberation (“Pink Pony Club”), mournful alienation (“California”) and two decidedly different forms of chaotic seduction (“Picture You,” “Red Wine Supernova”). In every mood and every song, she’s utterly commanding — witty and whip-smart, vocally assured and charismatic beyond words.

She didn’t just leave her wig; she left a mark.

PxZhSNla0U8,Jennifer Koh & Missy Mazzoli: Tiny Desk Concert,"Tom Huizenga | March 20, 2024
Thankfully, few no longer believe that playing classical music requires an evening gown or a tux. When composer Missy Mazzoli and violinist Jennifer Koh made their way into our Tiny Desk office space, we took note of the beautiful ink on Mazzoli‘s arm, her clunky black boots, and Koh’s bright blue hair and sleeveless leather dress.
 
The two artists have been collaborating for 15 years and this ferocious and beautiful set traces that history. It also reveals an essential equation of how classical music works: Mazzoli, the composer, who is currently writing a work for the Metropolitan Opera, conjures up music in her head, and Koh, the performer, breathes life into it.
 
Koh opens with Hail, Horrors, Hail, a recent solo piece she included on Alone Together, a homespun album recorded during the height of the pandemic which earned her a Grammy. Mazzoli joins at the keyboard in a bespoke arrangement of the final movement from Procession, Mazzoli’s sumptuous violin concerto, inspired by medieval healing rituals, which Koh premiered in 2022 with the National Symphony Orchestra.  
 
Dissolve, O my Heart, the first piece Mazzoli wrote for Koh, spirals out into an emotional journey touched with spasms of joy and grief. It’s rooted in late-night discussions fueled by Chinese food, cupcakes and Bach’s revered Chaconne D minor that is quoted at the beginning. Koh closes with Kinski Paganini, unsettled music inspired by the German actor Klaus Kinski’s volatile performances.   
 
Hearing this set, in all its rugged delight, feels like we’re eavesdropping on something personal — a fruitful, collaborative friendship between composer and performer that has yielded amazing music.

cMIJsoaxRjk,Justin Timberlake: Tiny Desk Concert,"Stephen Thompson | March 15, 2024
Walking into the room shortly before Justin Timberlake took our cramped stage, I overheard someone on his team wondering aloud if this was to be the most densely populated Tiny Desk concert in history — which is to say, the most musicians we've ever fit in a single frame. It's not, but we don't often find a way to cram in this many human beings (15 in all) and this much gear.

Timberlake has never been one to give partial effort, but this is a production befitting the occasion: namely, a set timed to drop concurrently with the release of his new album, Everything I Thought It Was. Eschewing the rootsier feel of its predecessor, 2018's Man of the Woods, the new record is a throwback, an epic and a blowout — and so's this lavish set, which scales the Timberlake experience down to 25 minutes of maximalist celebration and, when the moment calls for it, chiller vibes.

Backed by his band The Tennessee Kids, Timberlake's Tiny Desk debut leans heavily on his early solo catalog, as he kicks it off with two songs from 2002's classic Justified and weaves in three more from 2006's magnificent FutureSex/LoveSounds — including a set-closing ""SexyBack,"" which finds the singer trotting out a megaphone in a truly meme-worthy moment.

By the way, in case you're wondering, the all-time record for musicians behind the Tiny Desk is a whopping 23, a feat pulled off by the fantastic Mucca Pazza in 2015. But Timberlake and company rival that classic performance's energy — in both cases, the real triumph lies not in the Tetris of it all, but in the way that many people still find ways to move, buoyantly and as one mighty organism.

V9h3pk2Nc0Q,Squirrel Flower: Tiny Desk Concert,"Elle Mannion | March 13, 2024
“This little guy is someone we picked up on the road,” Squirrel Flower, aka songwriter Ella Williams, says between songs, referencing a tiny toy alligator resting on her mic stand. The Chicago-based indie rocker stopped by the Tiny Desk on the heels of touring her latest album, Tomorrow’s Fire. Here, she plays stripped back versions of her thundering rock songs without her band, giving way for her low register, affecting lyricism and guitar skills to shine.

There’s an intensity unique to each song Williams plays in her Tiny Desk set. “I told you, I've never been in love,” she begins on the aching ""Almost Pulled Away.” On “Alley Light,” she sings about not being able to take things slow, musing “maybe that’s why she loves me.” The set seems to reach its apex on “Finally Rain,” when Williams' vocals ring the loudest. But then for the closer, “Iowa 146,” Williams thaws as she performs with a quiet kind of focus that’s just as powerful. She carefully plucks her strings and asks gently: “If I play you guitar, will everything fall away?”

MgTDLlDY_yY,311: Tiny Desk Concert,"Maia Stern | March 11, 2024
What better way to spend March 11 than with 311 bringing love and nostalgia to the Tiny Desk. The members of 311, who have been a band together for over 30 years, strolled into NPR HQ and barely needed much rehearsal time before playing four of their most beloved tracks. The band has been performing these songs for decades, and you can tell it all just comes naturally. ""This kind of reminds me of being in my dad's basement, being back next to the pool table, but it smells better here,"" said lead singer Nick Hexum, who felt right at home and back to his roots at our office space.

311's self-titled album came out in 1995 when I was entering my peak angst stage. The songs on that album were the perfect soundtrack to all the pre-teen feelings I wasn't able to fully express myself. I also heavily related to what remains to be my favorite lyric of all time from the band's 1997 album Transistor: ""I do, I don't, whatever.""

311's Tiny Desk set started off with the song that lyric comes from, personal favorite ""Beautiful Disaster."" The band continued with classic ""All Mixed Up"" before chilling out a bit with ""Amber."" Then, as Hexum said before the band's final track, ""Down,"" it was ""back to the rock."" Listen out for SA's changed lyric honoring my and Tiny Desk's shared hometown: ""Fall in love with your teachers, on the wax we are self made / Check the technique, 311 in D.C.""

TeNMzwoCWSc,Wednesday: Tiny Desk Concert,"Hazel Cills | March 8, 2024
""I learned how to play guitar watching Tiny Desk concerts,"" Wednesday's lead singer Karly Hartzman says in the band's performance. Specifically, she says, by way of Mitski's scream-filled 2015 set. ""The chords to these songs are pretty easy, if you want to mirror 'em.""

The Asheville, N.C., rock band is constantly on the road, supporting Rat Saw God, which made NPR's best albums of 2023. But Wednesday made time to stop by NPR headquarters to play the Desk, toning down its noisy, country-influenced sound in a quieter setting. The rollicking opener ""Chosen to Deserve"" gets a pep in its step that begged for some in-office line dancing — nobody partook — before playing the quiet, romantic ""Formula One"" and ending with ""Bath County.""

And now, we count down to see which artist will cite Wednesday's performance as how they learned guitar.

K8gnt2Zc9aI,Butcher Brown: Tiny Desk Concert,"Nikki Birch | February 28, 2024
The ""solar music"" Butcher Brown brought to Tiny Desk was hot and funky from the count-in. What is solar music? It's the term the band uses to describe the various musical inspirations that influence its sound — simply put, everything under the sun. And everyone who attended this Tiny Desk Concert was feeling it. There were stank faces aplenty.

Hailing from Richmond, VA, a city that has given us musical icons like D'Angelo, Lonnie Liston Smith and the comedic weirdness of Gwar, Butcher Brown's cultivation of psychedelic jazz funk with a hip-hop polish has produced its latest album, Solar Music, and proves why the band gets ""daps from the jazz cats, the rap scene, the indie scene and everyone else,"" according to drummer Corey Fonville.

The collective musical ingenuity of the band shines through on the extremely danceable ""No Way Around It,"" the vibey interlude ""Fohbliv"" and head nodders including ""DYKWYD"" and ""I Can Say to You."" Butcher Brown brings it every time.

YKnifgh9dEQ,Irreversible Entanglements: Tiny Desk Concert,"Lars Gotrich | February 26, 2024
“When did your heart break?” It’s the question that Camae Ayewa asks to open this Tiny Desk, and one that's still rattling in my head. That soul puncture is an essential piece of Irreversible Entanglements, a free jazz band rooted in punk ethos. 

Individually, these folks have made some of the most creative and challenging music of the past decade: Ayewa’s ever-evolving project Moor Mother, trumpeter Aquiles Navarro and drummer Tcheser Holmes’ telepathic duets, saxophonist Keir Neuringer’s sonic monuments and bassist Luke Stewart’s restless projects as improviser and instigator. Deep catalogs for deep listeners. 

For this Tiny Desk, the band runs through six songs without breaks, starting with “Fireworks,” a personal favorite, then leaning into music from Protect Your Light, which was released on Impulse Records (aka, the house that John and Alice Coltrane built). Joined here by guest vocalist Kyle Kidd, it’s a joy to see Irreversible Entanglements work as a unit: hard-struck funk bass lines seamlessly shift to the horns, which constrict and expand the melody, and elastic drums create a fluid palette for Ayewa to spit, yawp and intone her poetry. To close, she gives us a crucial message to take into the darkness of this year or any: “We need your light / We can’t stop shining / We must be the sun.”

3prk1I5ged0,Kelela: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | Februrary 24, 2024
Kelela took her opportunity at the Tiny Desk to create something new. She swapped key pieces from her recordings (hard drums and effects) for a harp and piano. She also presented us with a challenge or two as well. While there weren't many bodies behind the Desk, the instruments left little room for movement. Pianist Briley Harris was barricaded by the keys, and background vocalists Brittney Mills and Alayna Rodgers were nestled next to Ahya Simone's big beautiful harp. When an artist presents us with a distinctive, creative vision for their performance, the fun part is collaborating to execute that idea.

This Tiny Desk was a homecoming for Kelela. She let the music do most of the speaking but not before shouting out Washington, D.C., where she was born. The setlist seamlessly showcases most parts of her catalog with a couple of brand new arrangements. ""Enough"" and ""Take Me Apart"" are almost unrecognizable, recast to allow Kelela's vocals to sit gently within the harp and keys. The singer found a thunder tube in our percussion section and tinkered with it during soundcheck. Toward the end of ""The High,"" she sings through it to alter her voice. That exploration and experimentation perfectly capture the essence of the show.

BgQw-xNsQe8,Cinder Well: Tiny Desk Concert,"Lars Gotrich | February 23, 2024
On overcast days, there's nothing like a hot cup of tea, a cozy blanket and some mystic music. While taping Cinder Well's Tiny Desk, gray clouds hung over NPR headquarters in Washington, D.C., urging the same kind of introspection — sympathetic scenery for a set of folk songs that wind around the passage of time.

Cinder Well's Amelia Baker grew up in California, but has spent much of her time on the Western cliffs of Ireland, soaking in the sea air of both the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. Her songs, too, reflect the Laurel Canyon's wandering spirit and the droning qualities of Irish folk music. Yet there's space between that Baker occupies, illustrated by this performance: A crimson glow surrounds the dark undercurrent of Cinder Well that only grows brighter as the music goes deeper into the unknown.

c9vtuEH-vfk,Jeezy: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | February 21, 2024
Motivation has always been the leading message of Jeezy's career and he's never veered off the path. The Atlanta superstar stayed consistent with his Tiny Desk, focusing on the early chapters of his career and creating a story arc in between songs. ""I was able to connect with my people and my culture because we spoke the same language,"" he explained before playing ""Go Crazy."" ""I wanted to inspire and give people the blueprint, people who wanted more for themselves.""

Jay ""Jeezy"" Jenkins' music could easily be taken at face value given the number of hits he's racked up over his two-decade career, but he made his target audience and intention clear through the titles of his Thug Motivation albums. He's taken his mission far beyond music, excelling as an investor and more recently an author. His memoir, Adversity for Sale: Ya Gotta Believe, made it to the New York Times bestseller list.

The Snowman enlisted Tiny Desk vet and bassist D. Hodge to assemble a band to breathe new life into selections from his catalog. The string section brought opulence to these gritty street anthems and features two familiar faces: viola player Lelia-Michelle Walker and NPR's own Ashley Pointer on violin. Jeezy dedicated ""Everythang"" from TM:103 Hustlerz Ambition to Pointer and showed plenty of love to the group of Howard University students in the crowd. This is Black History at its finest.

1IJjriRrOKg,Tinashe: Tiny Desk Concert,"Alanté Serene | February 16, 2024
Tinashe has never been one-dimensional. With the many titles of singer, songwriter, producer, engineer and dancer under her belt, she came to the Tiny Desk and proved just that. A snow storm may have kept many Washington, D.C. natives in their home that day, but Tinashe was at the office bright and early with an infectious smile and spirit that would warm up any chill in the building.

Since starting her music career in 2007, Tinashe has created songs in genres spanning from pop to electro-R&B. And as the Aquarius said herself, ""at this point, I've really demonstrated that I don't necessarily fit into one genre."" At the Tiny Desk, Tinashe presents cuts from several different projects. First, comforting the crowd with the vulnerability of ""Treason,"" from her album BB/Ang3l, accompanied by a vibraphone which she plays live for the first time ever. Tinashe switches gears with ""Unconditional,"" the Kaytranada-produced track off her album 333. Then the artist performed one of her self-proclaimed favorite tracks, ""Touch And Go,"" from her album Songs for You. To conclude her high-energy set, Tinashe performed her breakout single, ""2 On,"" right on time for its 10-year anniversary. As I sang, danced and cheered along with the rest of the crowd, I thought to myself, this is a show worth trekking through the snow for.

h2YdwoZpVgE,Berhana: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | February 14, 2024
Months before he released Amén (The Nomad's Dream), Atlanta singer Berhana shared his Tiny Desk vision with me: He wanted to pay homage to his roots with Ethiopian jazz pianist Kibrom Birhane and members of the Ethio Cali band to showcase their authentic take on East African rhythms. Draped in a traditional Ethiopian scarf at the Tiny Desk, he incorporates those elements to a T.

So much of the genre-fluid Amén is about personal growth and finding home. His first trip to Ethiopia was the driving force behind the new project, but the storytelling prowess is carried over from 2019's HAN. Before closing his set with ""Going Home,"" he expressed his gratitude for the moment. ""It's because we live within this confined amount of time, that we're able to find meaning,"" he says. ""I've been trying to accept that a little bit more and be grateful for the little moments like this that I get to share with you guys right now.""

yskw0JMXQaM,Carrtoons: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | February 12, 2024
In the spirit of Kenny Beats, Zaytoven, and Nile Rodgers, Ben Carr, aka Carrtoons keeps the producer-led Tiny Desk tradition alive. Another tradition developed over the years is the first look each artist gets at the Desk when they first walk into the space. In some cases, it feels like a star meeting another star. But here, it's a musician who's made a name for himself composing for others, emerging as an artist in his own right. He walked straight to the Desk in attack mode.

I first heard of Carrtoons while I was locked in the house during the COVID-19 pandemic. I was scrolling on Instagram and found him playing his bass guitar to looped and chopped samples he cooked up. The Carrtoons rabbit hole led me to other producers who created similarly on social media. A few of my favorites including Kiefer, who plays keys for this set, got together for a special Tiny Desk (home) concert in 2021. The family vibes were in abundance for this performance. Carr's father Richard plays in the string section, and the vocal power trio of Haile Supreme, Joanna Teters and Julia Zivic are frequent collaborators. Carr graciously lent his spotlight to play highlights from his albums Saturday Night and Homegrown.

lqBEfjDRDHk,Joshua Redman: Tiny Desk Concert,"Mitra I. Arthur | February 9, 2024
Saxophonist and composer Joshua Redman is a regular on NPR's Jazz Night in America, featured on episodes including a tribute to his father, saxophonist Dewey Redman, and a reunion with his former quartet featuring Brad Mehldau, Jazz Night host Christian McBride and Brian Blade. Since his debut in the 1990s, Redman has built a career thoughtfully exploring every crevice of modern jazz and infusing it with the variety of genres he grew up listening to.

Here, Redman presents cuts from his latest album, Where Are We, a medication on the complexities of America, featuring new collaborator vocalist Gabrielle Cavassa. In ""Chicago Blues,"" Redman's take on a Count Basie classic, and a cover of Bruce Springsteen's ""Streets of Philadelphia,"" Cavassa and Redman dance over the anchoring grooves from bassist Philip Norris and drummer Nazir Ebo, while pianist Paul Cornish delivers a stunning improvised transition between the two songs. For the final selection, Redman opens with an improvisation on ""America the Beautiful."" The traditional, patriotic tune is a stark contrast to the ugly inspiration for the plaintive ""After Minneapolis"" that follows, about the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. The song's growing maelstrom surrounds Redman's haunting wails and Cavassa's mournful interpretation of Redman's lyrics. Throughout, Redman's solos serve to illustrate why he is one of today's best saxophonists.

5Zw0K4SlqHQ,Timo Andres: Tiny Desk Concert,"Tom Huizenga | February 7, 2024
It's a longstanding tradition for musicians to leave a small something-or-other on the thoroughly disorganized wall of ""stuff"" that backdrops our Tiny Desk. My favorite is the Johann Sebastian Bach bobblehead.

But now, move over Bach. Here comes Philip Glass.

When Timo Andres arrived at our office to play a pair of etudes by Philip Glass, the director of Glass' publishing house, Adrienne White, tagged along and generously donated the only remaining Philip Glass bobblehead to NPR — an appropriate gesture to mark the composer's 87th birthday on Jan. 31.

The wiggly statue depicts Glass standing at one of his trusty Farfisa organs, an instrument associated with the early days of his career when he played intricate patterns over and over in his SoHo loft, as fans and fellow musicians, like Laurie Anderson, laid on the floor and let the music wash over them.

Much of Glass' music can have that transforming, mesmerizing effect, including these two etudes. They are opposite twins from a set of 20, pieces Glass wrote over a two-decade span, beginning in the early 1990s. Andres knows the music intimately — he helped edit and design a gorgeous new folio facsimile of the sheet music.

With Etude No. 6, Andres combines sewing machine precision with a deep feeling for Glass' melodies, stitching together delicate arpeggios and thundering chords. Etude No. 5 is, by contrast, a meditation in slow motion. A see-sawing rhythmic idea sets the foundation for a journey wherein time seems to stand almost still while the spaces between the notes speak volumes.

TGU0-1PBW54,Katie Von Schleicher: Tiny Desk Concert,"Elle Mannion | February 5, 2024
I didn't fact check this, but I'm pretty sure this is the first Tiny Desk concert that mentions Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. Between performing her lush indie-rock songs, Katie Von Schleicher mentions that she made a Dwayne Johnson zine for her latest record: ""I'd like him to be my best friend, if you know him..."" she says. There's a wry charm to Von Schleicher's exquisite songwriting, often underscoring its sincerity but never cheapening its quality.

Along with her mighty eight-piece band, Von Schleicher opens the set with ""Montagnard People,"" which is also the opening track on her 2023 album A Little Touch of Schleicher in the Night (yes, that's a nod to Harry Nilsson's A Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night). ""Honestly, my tight five needs work / To get past hurts, I'm alive,"" she sings over swinging strings and saxophones, ""Watching movies at night / only Dwayne Johnson helps me take that ride.""

She and the band pack the biggest punch on the upbeat ""Caged Sleep"" before grooving through ""Cranked."" For the final song, ""Texas,"" Von Schleicher takes to the piano; she starts slowly, then the sounds of the band swell to a cinematic crescendo — perhaps one that could soundtrack the next best Dwayne Johnson movie.

-4J-f5lkCLo,Thee Sacred Souls: Tiny Desk Concert,"Anamaria Sayre | February 2, 2024
San Diego-based trio Thee Sacred Souls made its mark at the Tiny Desk with satin vocals and vintage melodies. Paying homage to southern California Latino culture meeting American soul roots, the group's sweet fusion melodies brought history and love into the space.

The trio opened the concert with ""Will I See You Again?,"" which tells the tale of a confused, forlorn lover with soft, harmony-laden lyrics and bouncy guitar and bass. Lead singer Josh Lane then pauses to share a message of love, the kind the band is focused on consistently extending. ""Love Is The Way"" paints a picturesque image of a sweet, timeless love fit to be celebrated top-down out the back of a low-rider. ""Easier Said than Done"" brings more reflective energy atop floaty high harmonies from Tiny Desk veteran Astyn Turr. With a transition to a horns-adorned ""Love Comes Easy,"" the band hits even more of a groove before ending with the easy-listening ""Can I Call You Rose?"" The band brought what it does best: great melodies, romantic lyrics and a vibe that fills any space it plays with light and tranquility, fit for any era.

4RcKtr5bGa4,Hania Rani: Tiny Desk Concert,"Lars Gotrich | January 29, 2024
Hania Rani makes beautiful music that’s haunted, yet enchanted. The Polish pianist and composer blurs the lines of ambient, classical and house — submerged beats pulse under ripples of piano, synths and her delicate voice. She regularly performs in concert halls across Europe, but during an American tour she brought the cinematic, yet intimate songs of her album Ghosts to the Tiny Desk. 

Rani is conservatory trained, but like so many post-classical artists working right now, brings her own influences to centuries-old tradition. The way her fingers chromatically surge in a cascade of color suggest the later compositions of Mozart — somehow lush and sublime in their tension, on the brink of something different. But there’s also a restlessness in how Rani, accompanied by Ziemowit Klimek on upright bass and synth, bounces between the piano and synths with ease and often within the same song. She is a wonder to watch.

When he arrived at NPR headquarters, Juwan Elcock, aka BLK ODYSSY, pulled out a lifelike severed human head made of silicone and placed it on the Desk. It's the same head seen in the hands of a woman on the cover of his latest album, DIAMONDS & FREAKS, a project that depicts love and lust as addictive vices.

The visual components are just as compelling and help specify that BLK ODYSSY is the modern personification of funk. I love where the current state of R&B music sits, but it can always use more funk. This Tiny Desk is an 18-minute flex, highlighting the best of DIAMONDS & FREAKS, plus the premiere of a new song, ""I WANT YOU,"" and a set that climaxes with 2021's ""FUNKENTOLOGY.""

fVRccRHfCxM,yMusic: Tiny Desk Concert,"Tom Huizenga | January 19, 2024
Back in 2008, the same year my colleagues Bob Boilen and Stephen Thompson dreamt up the idea for these Tiny Desk concerts, a cohort of freelance musicians formed in New York, calling itself yMusic (referring to ""Gen Y"" millennials). That random aligning of planets has now resulted in this terrific performance at the NPR office space with four original compositions in a musical language that borrows from classical and pop but could only be yMusic.

The band's unique sound is born not only from the tight construction and performance of the music, but also from the yMusic's quirky setup. How many other sextets of trumpet, clarinet, flute, violin, viola and cello do you know?

The set opens with ""Zebras,"" inspired by the frenzied clicking keys of Mark Dover's bass clarinet. Music emerges softly but takes flight when flutist Alex Sopp doubles on vocals. Chugging rhythms propel ""Flood"" as solos are passed around, while the more contemplative ""Peter Inn"" showcases lovely muted colors in the winds, with intrepid trumpeter CJ Camerieri switching to French horn. ""The Wolf"" closes the set with yMusic rising to its loudest, driven by a clever yipping theme in the winds as cello and viola slide up the scale.

yMusic is completely at home backing up the likes of Paul Simon, The National and Dirty Projectors, or performing music it has commissioned from today's top composers including Andrew Norman and Caroline Shaw at upscale venues like Carnegie Hall. Genres be damned.

h3gwRr_54cE,The Japanese House: Tiny Desk Concert,"Stephen Thompson | January 18, 2024
The Japanese House, a.k.a. the recording project of U.K. singer-songwriter Amber Bain, put out my favorite album of 2023: In the End It Always Does is an irresistible electro-pop record full of warmly relatable songs about desire, regret and the fear that no one will ever love you as much as the dog nestled in your lap. It's a wonderful record that's buoyed by impeccably chosen guests — MUNA's Katie Gavin, Bon Iver's Justin Vernon, two members of The 1975 — and a pervasive mood of low-key dreaminess.

At the Tiny Desk, Bain recasts four of In the End It Always Does' songs in fresh arrangements that swap out the synths while highlighting the more organic sounds of brushed drums, a violin, a spare piano and the occasional baritone sax. And, though she closes with the album's effervescent lead single ""Boyhood,"" Bain also uses her set to center the album's softer material — particularly the lush gem ""Baby Goes Again,"" which has no business languishing as a deep cut.

l_P4UjbkSJk,The Good Ones: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | January 17, 2024
It is difficult to merely take in a performance by the Rwandan group known as The Good Ones. The pathos of the band and the country’s recent history permeates the duo’s existence and its music.

Adrian Kazigira and Janvier Havugimana were taught music by the latter’s older brother, who then perished during the country’s brutal genocide. They formed a band as a way to process their nation’s trauma and also bring together Rwanda’s three tribes: Tutsi, Hutu, and Abatwa.

From the start, the simple guitar fingerpicking style and very sparse rhythm guide the plaintive vocals into a trance-like meditation. The music is a fascinating mix of guitar strumming that combines the kind of cyclical song form you hear on the West African kora and vocal harmonizing common to many African musical traditions.

The group’s origin story may be tragic, but The Good Ones’ determination to spread its musical message is an inspiration.

SET LIST
“The Farmer”

“Seraphinne, You are the Prettiest Woman in the World”

zIYIn7yTtTo,Sunny Jain's Wild Wild East: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | January 12, 2024
From the very first note, Sunny Jain’s music promotes the idea of not just crossing boundaries but obliterating them all together.

The percussionist, composer and bandleader has roots in South Asia and his band and album Wild Wild East are expertly adept at infusing the sounds and melodies of that part of the world into an intense yet joyful performance. There are references to his parents’ journey to the U.S., Sufi dance music and the mash-up of Bollywood and the Italian westerns of the 1960s.

Sunny Jain’s latest musical exploration is another road taken from his days leading the Brooklyn bhangra band Red Baraat (which did an explosive Tiny Desk concert in 2017) and if you listen closely you’ll hear how unique his musical vision is. In fact, if his musical projects were actual travel junkets, I would whip out my passport and jump on board as soon as I could.

SET LIST
“Immigrant Warrior”

o4Iv7k0aQoc,Kevin Kaarl: Tiny Desk Concert,"Anamaria Sayre | January 8, 2024
Singer-songwriter Kevin Kaarl applies his indie-drenched vocals with an entirely new vision at his Tiny Desk concert. Pairing folksy, trumpet rhythms with twangy banjo, the Chihuahuan artist transfigures traditional Sinaloan instrumentation into styles more recognizable among American folk bands.

Opening with ""Me Va a Costar,"" twin brother and trumpet player Brian spins sweet harmony on the track. Transitioning to the guitar and banjo-driven, trumpet adorned ""Te Quiero Tanto,"" Kaarl strings together romantic melodies with endlessly rich vibratos and stunning falsetto.

He switches to one of his earliest hits, the relentlessly romantic ""Vámonos a Marte."" ""Vámonos de viaje a las estrellas y a Marte (Let's go on a trip to the stars and Mars),"" he coos, ""A olvidar nuestros problemas, tan punzantes (To forget our stinging problems).""

He pauses to leave a regalo (one of his boots, and he confirmed he walked home with one foot shoeless after doing so) and then ends with the folky ""San Lucas"" — a track fit for any indie king.

Multi-faceted in his lyricism and vocal abilities, Kevin Kaarl took his banda Sinaloense roots and shined in performing a style that virtually none in his part of the world are playing with, innovating and smiling all the while.

Dj5Y5VwhfHs,Sweeney Todd: Tiny Desk Concert,"Josh Rogosin | December 22, 2023
My parents brought me to see a production of Sweeney Todd when I was 10; I had nightmares for weeks. That may have been the beginning of my obsession with the Demon Barber of Fleet Street. 

""We're so grateful to sing Stephen Sondheim's masterpiece every single day,"" Josh Groban explains at the Tiny Desk. ""He was so brilliant at juxtaposing the beautiful with the horrific."" (It turns out that both Groban and I named our dogs ""Sweeney Dog,"" something I learned when I introduced the cast.)

Expect a wave of emotions throughout this performance: empathy for Sweeney (Groban) and Mrs. Lovett (Annaleigh Ashford) with their songs of vengeance and longing, ""My Friends,"" and ""By the Sea""; desire with the quartet's vocal counterpoint performed in ""Johanna (Act 2 Sequence)""; laughter with the duet's performance of ""A Little Priest."" Incredibly, this Tiny Desk version of the musical is no less impactful — the 26-piece orchestra currently playing the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre gets a nine-piece orchestration courtesy of Jonathan Tunick, Sondheim's longtime collaborator, led by conductor Alex Lacamoire. Absolutely mesmerizing.

xdOSi8E3FT0,Louis Cato: Tiny Desk Concert,"Nikki Birch | December 20, 2023
There is something special about Louis Cato’s ability to captivate an audience. During this Tiny Desk, he expresses his belief that music is most powerful when experienced in a live setting — it’s there that we build community. With rhythmic strumming and a winning smile, he draws us into his honest, thoughtful and vulnerable storytelling.

Not only does Cato sing and excel at multiple instruments, he holds his own on the other side of the microphone, producing, mixing and, most visibly, serving as bandleader for The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. If this is your first encounter with Cato, you’ll quickly get a sense of his immense musicality. He’s the type of musician who inspires other musicians and, as such, is very much in demand. Indeed, at the Tiny Desk, it's a fellowship of good vibes as Cato and his band — bassist Jeremy McDonald, guitarist Randy Runyon and drummer James Williams — guide us through an introspective journey of the love we have for others, ourselves and humanity.

ajNYTJcF6rE,Scarface: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | December 18, 2023
Scarface's Tiny Desk concert radiates with his decadeslong passion as an emcee and producer. There's calculated intent behind every word and note of this 30-minute set and I learned that his love for golf also runs deep during our initial meeting. He was playing a round and had difficulty dividing his attention between the plan and the course. Three days before the show, amid rehearsals, I got a call from Facemob asking, ""What if I brought Mike Dean?"" My expectations were already high, but that final addition set the stage for something special.

Mike Dean provided unmatched authenticity, and their shared stories added sentimental value to this performance. After all, his signature keys and synths can be heard on most of Scarface's classics and countless Rap-A-Lot records. Here, we get a rare glimpse of Scarface the conductor, bouncing through multiple eras of his catalog including ""On My Block,"" ""Mary Jane"" and the bone-chilling ""I Seen a Man Die.""

Scarface, along with Rakim, was recently awarded the inaugural Hip-Hop Grandmaster Award from the newly launched Paid in Full Foundation, which includes a sizable financial prize and healthcare. No matter how the never-ending hip-hop greats debate is sliced, the rapper's place is cemented as one of the most influential storytellers in the culture and his Tiny Desk is proof.

RBRQ8vR93_s,Alvvays: Tiny Desk Concert,"Stephen Thompson | December 15, 2023
Tiny Desk concerts involve challenges and constraints that aren't always immediately apparent: The crowd stands closer than many artists expect, it's truly a working office and not a soundstage, in-ear monitors are a no-no and so on. The guideline that caught Alvvays off-guard came in the form of our limit on reverb and other vocal sweeteners, which get used to glorious effect on 2022's Blue Rev, but are otherwise frowned-upon at the Tiny Desk.

The restriction forced the Toronto band — and recent first-time Grammy nominee — well outside its comfort zone. But it also shined a bright light on the radiant and expressive voice of Molly Rankin while proving, in the spirit of T-Pain, that not every vocal enhancement is there to hide imperfections. Still, Rankin acknowledged the nerves involved in making this show happen: ""We've not worked up the courage to do this until today,"" she said with a chuckle, acknowledging (however indirectly) that we'd been trying to make this Tiny Desk concert happen for ages.

The band needn't have worried, as its magnificent recreation of Blue Rev's billowy, shoegaze-y sound lit up the room. By the time Rankin joked about replacing a retiring Bob Boilen, we were half-inclined to give her the job, just to keep Alvvays from leaving. Can you imagine a more lopsided trade?

avjI3_GIZBw,Laufey: Tiny Desk Concert,"Ashley Pointer | December 13, 2023
""I grew up playing classical music and it's so special to get to play my songs almost in this chamber-like setting,"" Laufey says in her performance. Accompanied by a string quartet, the singer-songwriter's modern jazz-pop love songs soared at the Tiny Desk, the intimacy of our little corner only heightened its impact.

Laufey's music undeniably bridges the gap between jazz and younger, mainstream audiences coming to the genre. Her sophomore album, Bewitched, broke Spotify's all-time streaming record for a jazz debut ever in the platform's history and resulted in her first Grammy nomination. She opens the set with ""From The Start,"" a bouncy, whimsical tune about unrequited love with a friend, connecting Chet Baker-like scats with charming and playful lyrics. Taking a more melancholic turn into 2021's ""Let You Break My Heart Again"" and ""Promise,"" her velvety vocals rich with vulnerability dance elegantly with the strings, creating a symphony of emotions. Laufey concludes the set with ""California and Me,"" which she explains was heavily influenced by her receiving her first baby grand and compositions by Liszt and Chopin. This mesmerizing performance is a captivating testament to the power of collaboration and music's ability to evoke raw, unfiltered emotion.

jmh3iruf4RA,Olivia Rodrigo: Tiny Desk Concert,"Hazel Cills | December 11, 2023
The last time Olivia Rodrigo performed a Tiny Desk concert, it was two years ago, in a deserted DMV office, back when pandemic precautions meant artists sadly couldn't play the real Desk. But this year, the singer-songwriter returned, bringing a handful of songs from her wildly fun sophomore album to the NPR Music office. ""It's much cooler to be here,"" Rodrigo says. ""I was saying earlier, I've never been starstruck by a room before.""

Many of the songs on GUTS, which earned a special recommendation on NPR Music's Best Albums of 2023 list, blow out Rodrigo's sound into colorful, grungy pop-rock fit for a stadium, like ""love is embarrassing,"" performed here with Rodrigo on jangly acoustic guitar. But the artist builds her set out with GUTS cuts that fit the intimate setup, like the searing ""vampire,"" her backup vocalists cooing eerily around each of her lines, or the potent ode to female jealousy, ""lacy,"" which Rodrigo explains started out as a poetry exercise in a college class. By the end of her set, she's completely alone at the piano for the sobering ""making the bed,"" and it's not difficult to see why she's one of pop's most promising rising performers.

The LeeVees have been my Hanukkah tradition since 2005, with the release of the group's album Hanukkah Rocks. It's an album I play every year because, honestly, it's hard to find fun-filled songs about latkes and gelt. The LeeVees are led by Adam LeeVee (Adam Gardner), who you may know from his long-time rock band Guster, and David LeeVee (Dave Schneider), who writes songs about ice hockey in his band, the Zambonis.

The LeeVees' first advice for this Tiny Hanukkah party is to loosen up, as the band asks the age-old question I've been wondering my entire life: ""How Do You Spell Channukkahh?"" We also hear about one of the great debates I grew up with in Brooklyn Jewish culture, in the song ""Applesauce vs. Sour Cream."" There's much talk about those delicious, oily potato pancakes we feast on this time of year: latkes. As bass player Shawn Fogel says, ""This may be the most food ever eaten at a Tiny Desk concert."" I made bagels for the crew, our video producer Maia Stern made yummy kugel and the latkes came from a local deli. There certainly is a more serious side to the festival of lights known as Hanukkah, but celebrating the lighter side felt much needed. Happy ""Channukkahh"" everyone.

x26X-N81wY0,Philip Selway: Tiny Desk Concert,"Stephen Thompson | December 4, 2023
Philip Selway knows how to surround himself with talent. Best known as Radiohead's longtime drummer, Selway also presides over richly rewarding collaborations on his gorgeous, ruminative solo records.

For his Tiny Desk concert, Selway brought in a fresh group of high-octane partners in the form of former Antibalas drummer Chris Vatalaro — ""There is absolutely no way I am playing drums in front of Chris, ever,"" Selway said as he introduced the band — as well as four members of the brilliant American Contemporary Music Ensemble. (A similar ACME lineup graced the Tiny Desk with Max Richter in early 2020, in case you feel like revisiting it and having a li'l cry.)

For his part, Selway performed three songs from this year's Strange Dance — his first solo project in nearly nine years — with a mix of deep warmth and wry, self-effacing modesty. It's an approach that suits his kind, lived-in songs, which echo everyone from Nick Drake to, in their gentlest moments, bands like Pink Floyd and The Kinks.

_Y-X9CpSiQ0,Aja Monet: Tiny Desk Concert,"Nikki Birch | December 1, 2023

Djembe. Drums. Piano and bass. A sweeping groove beckoned, welcoming us into the world of surrealist blues poet, Aja Monet. Transformed into a lush garden, the Tiny Desk bloomed with the stanzas, sounds and legacy of jazz poetry. 

Monet’s poems cast unflinching eyes towards love, justice, accountability and the joy and healing of daughters and sons of the Black diaspora. At times, her words — gentle gut punches to the soul and psyche — had those in attendance whooping in agreement or silently weeping. These lyrical jokes, jabs and caresses were accentuated by her accompanists, a band made up of Tiny Desk veterans (Nate Smith and Logan Richardson) and jazz legends, including pianist and composer Brian Jackson, a long-time collaborator of renowned jazz poet Gil Scott-Heron.

Like the many jazz poets who came before her, Monet’s poetry is an invitation to question the world around you, to explore the sacred space within, to drown in the depths of your emotions and resurface with gratitude. All of these poems are featured on Monet’s latest album, when the poems do what they do, and her performance brings them to life in a way that makes you think you ought to lean in closer and absorb every word. She’s got bars.

WyXFfKYbtQU,Sampha: Tiny Desk Concert,"Ashley Pointer | November 29, 2023
When Sampha first performed at the Tiny Desk in 2017, it was just him and his keys. But for this second round, he had a very specific vision to execute. Accompanied by a spirited four-piece band who double as his background singers and percussionists, each member relishes in making music in multiple, creative configurations.

Sampha Lahai Sisay's music is known for its sheer vulnerability in tackling the human experience. On his debut album, Process, we met a son mourning the loss of his parents while navigating the relationship with his partner and future mother of his first child. On a transcendental follow up, LAHAI, we now meet Sampha as a father and a companion, asking us to revel in the magic of our existence.

In this Tiny Desk concert, Sampha performs three songs from LAHAI — ""Spirit 2.0,"" ""Only"" and ""Dancing Circles"" — expertly rearranging each to sound exactly like its recorded version, allowing his ethereal voice and infectious grooves to wash over the room. Concluding the set with ""Without,"" Sampha and his band gather in a drum circle, creating a cacophony of percussive rhythms, building the song from the bottom up. The performance ends with Sampha singing solo at the piano, beautifully reminiscent of his first Tiny Desk, except this time with his partner and children sitting criss-cross applesauce in front of the Desk. Truly a full circle moment.

fj3tpPKUFaA,William Prince: Tiny Desk Concert,"Lars Gotrich | November 22, 2023
There are thousands of love songs sung sweetly and strummed softly by a big guy with a big heart. But there's only one William Prince. The singer-songwriter from the Peguis First Nation has a disarming presence at the Tiny Desk — his voice warm, eyes smiling.

Prince had flown into Washington, D.C., on a red-eye flight. Jetlagged, he took a long nap on one of our couches, roused himself, then quietly commanded the room. These songs, two of which are from his 2023 album Stand in the Joy, swoon at the wonders of love, but more importantly give partners space to grow and bloom over time. Prince had performed a Tiny Desk (home) concert in 2021, so here he improvises a little song of gratitude with a wink: ""I'd thought the Desk would be tinier.""

lXd4EmgFozI,Shucked: Tiny Desk Concert,"Josh Rogosin | November 20, 2023
There was only one request I made to the creative team for Shucked: I need to see the corn kickline on the Tiny Desk, or it can't happen. Thankfully, choreographer Sarah O'Gleby came down to Washington, D.C. for the recording and made all my dreams come true. Shucked is the most fun you'll have on Broadway this season. There are a lot of great shows to see, but if you want to laugh, Shucked is the ticket. Lucky for us all, it's going on a national tour in the fall of 2024.

Songwriting team Brandy Clark and Shane McAnally have plenty to say about their admiration for the performers interpreting their music for the stage. ""The legend is that I threw a shoe,"" McAnally explains, recalling his excitement after seeing Alex Newell perform ""Independently Owned"" for the first time. ""But I also threw my book with all my music.""

Halfway through the set, Clark starts singing her beautiful ballad written for the show, ""Maybe Love,"" then Isabelle McCalla takes over as her character, Maizy. ""We're going to show you the transformation that these songs take,"" Clark summarizes. ""We write very simple songs and we're simple singers, and it's amazing to see our simple songs and voices turned into this.""

pSUgrhmtXIw,PJ Harvey: Tiny Desk Concert,"Ann Powers | November 17, 2023
Polly Harvey has inhabited many characters throughout her 30-year career and always dressed the part: catsuit-rocking glam queen, high-collared Victorian wraith, mini-skirted libertine, feather-adorned warrior. Bringing the story told in her latest album, I Inside the Old Year Dying to the Tiny Desk, she stands at the microphone in a draped dress the wintry color of a gray alder tree, designed by her longtime costumier Todd Lynn. Its torn elegance perfectly suits the dual role she plays in these gently ferocious songs, which originated in her novel-in-verse, Orlam. As she lets loose her inimitable razor-sharp alto, she becomes both Ira-Abel, the child who, in the aftermath of an assault, merges with the forest around her Dorset, England, home, and of the bard whose verses keep that shepherd girl alive after her vanishing.

Harvey keeps her gestures minimal as she sets her scenes and speaks through them. Matching her voice to those of her trusted collaborators John Parish and James Johnston as they invoke the forest's ghosts — the ""chalky children of evermore"" — she lets the fecund imagery of her lyrics resonate. At times the crowd seems stunned into silence; after her lament for Ira-Abel, ""A Noiseless Noise,"" concludes with the notes from her acoustic and Parish's electric guitar intertwining, she coolly waits out a gap before the applause and hoots of appreciation arrive. 

This is where Harvey lives as a fully realized artist: on her own artistic plane, inviting listeners to take their time to fully join her. Ending with the heart-rendingly lonesome title track from 2007's White Chalk, she connects Ira-Abel's story to her lifelong project of expressiing women's solitude, pain and resistance. Exploring how human boundaries can shatter, reassert themselves or be rendered irrelevant, these songs create a contained space that echoes far beyond itself.

wzlZ68ts-IU,Marta Pereira da Costa: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | November 15, 2023
From the very first beat in this performance, it's clear we are being transported to another time and space with Marta Pereira da Costa's enchanting time behind the Tiny Desk.

Considered to be the first and only woman to professionally master the traditional Portuguese guitar used in fado music, Pereira da Costa caught my attention in a crowded bar in Austin, Texas in 2019 during South by Southwest. In fact, with echoes of Bob Boilen and Stephen Thompson's experience with Laura Gibson that gave birth to the Tiny Desk concert, I also wanted to hear Pereira da Costa's melodic fingerpicking prowess without the noisy crowd.

Accompanied by second guitarist João José Pita Junior and percussionist Pedro Segundo, the trio bridges centuries of history with immaculate playing and plenty of smiles. As Pereira da Costa states in between songs, the entire performance is a musical journey through her homeland, from land to sea and everything in between.

Fado has achieved international recognition outside of Portugal among the musically curious, and I usually associate it with a variety of renowned vocalists. But Pereira da Costa reminds us to pay attention to the accompanists and their instruments for a deeper appreciation of tradition and music made in the moment.

Xn5wfH_erZ0,Hayden Pedigo: Tiny Desk Concert,"Lars Gotrich | November 13, 2023
Hayden Pedigo's guitar tells stories through musical landscapes. At the Tiny Desk, he plays quiet, gentle melodies inspired by his Texas panhandle home that still manage to kick up little dust storms of the soul.

As a teenager, Pedigo picked up fingerstyle guitar by way of John Fahey and Robbie Basho. A decade later, his songs have taken on ambient and avant-garde textures, yet have never strayed from a strong, narrative drive. The set here features ""Elsewhere"" and the title track from his most recent record, The Happiest Times I Ever Ignored, plus ""Carthage,"" a personal favorite of mine, via 2021's Letting Go. On songs performed with six- and 12-string acoustic guitars, he makes you lean into the silence to wonder what small gifts await; Pedigo assures us that the long pauses represent Amarillo, Texas' ""flat plains that go on forever.""

To close, he plays a song inspired by a letter written by National Lampoon founder Doug Kenney; on a borrowed Telecaster outfitted with three humbuckers, ""The Happiest Times I Ever Ignored"" then takes on a thicker tone à la slowcore cult favorites Duster, rendering the song's bittersweet melody a rumbling tribute.

JtCB7vy1q2E,Noname: Tiny Desk Concert,"Ashley Pointer | November 10, 2023
Out of the thousand and some Tiny Desk concerts to date, it’s seldom an artist returns to the Desk. But when they do, there are a couple requirements: come in a new iteration or present something completely different. In this case, the Chicago-bred, emcee-activist Noname does both when she performs some revolutionary raps from her third album, Sundial, and premieres an unreleased single from hip-hop trio Ghetto Sage, made up of her and frequent collaborators, Smino and Saba. 

A lot has changed since Fatimah Warner dropped her classic debut, Telefone, in 2016 and made her first appearance behind the Tiny Desk in 2017. She released a stunning follow-up, Room 25, and she even briefly paused her music career to delve deep into her work as an activist. However, holding a mirror up to herself, her community and the music industry is a signature that persists across her career, and even more so on her album Sundial. 

Complemented by her dynamic six-piece band, she performs a few selects from this album including the gospel-infused “Hold Me Down,” which Noname describes perfectly as “a petty love letter to my community.” Then she gets into “Boomboom” featuring the vocalist Ayoni, who delivers a raw and powerful performance. She then invites Smino and Saba up to perform the unreleased “Kush and Love Songs,” delivering clever and conscious bars on top of a swing groove. Concluding the show in true Noname fashion with “Balloons,” she asks the audience: “Where better to do my most controversial song than NPR? Real journalism.”

lCQAgRoVMCo,Samia: Tiny Desk Concert,"Stephen Thompson | November 8, 2023
There's plenty of curious timing in Samia's Tiny Desk debut. For starters, this was the final Tiny Desk concert produced by Bob Boilen — he came in for one last Monday to accommodate the performance — which meant the singer-songwriter had to endure the reluctant tributes paid to Bob as she waited patiently to perform. Then there's the timing of Samia's song selection: All five of these tracks appeared on her terrific debut album (2020's The Baby) and not this year's equally magnificent Honey. Which is saying nothing of the fact that Samia is actress Kathy Najimy's daughter, yet we opted to run this performance a full week after the conclusion of Hocus Pocus Season! What were we thinking?

Fortunately, Samia's set nevertheless provides a stunning showcase for her charisma, vocal talent and deftly detailed lyricism. She possesses a remarkable knack for specificity in her songwriting, which finds her name-dropping her favorite bands, recounting conversations in devastating detail and even shining a light on songwriting itself. (""I only write songs about things that I'm scared of,"" she sings in ""Is There Something in the Movies?"" before adding, ""So here, now you're deathless in art."")

Taking advantage of the Tiny Desk's quietude, Samia and her band chose to focus on the more subdued side of their sound, even deploying the sample of her grandmother that opens ""Pool."" As a result, it's easier and more rewarding than ever to hang on her every word.

MQjo5pxpC88,Emerson String Quartet: Tiny Desk Concert,"Tom Huizenga | November 6, 2023
The cameras were rolling long before the Emerson String Quartet played a note behind the Tiny Desk. A documentary film crew followed the band into our lobby and kept rolling tape as the players unpacked their instruments, sat down to warm up and joked ceaselessly among themselves.

The reason for all the fuss was to mark the final days of the nearly 50-year career of one of modern history’s most durable, beloved and prolific chamber ensembles. Just two days after we captured this performance, the band played its final concert together in New York, where it all began in 1976 when a couple Juilliard students thought putting together a string quartet might be a fun idea. Forty-some albums, nine Grammys and countless concerts later, we were honored to document one of the band’s last performances.

Typical for the Emersons, the music they chose was wide-ranging. A dash of Haydn served as a witty amuse-bouche, then on to a mini-movement from late in Beethoven’s career, when the composer could swing his moods with shockingly modern abandon. At the heart of this bittersweet concert is the Emersons’ achingly beautiful performance of George Walker’s Lyric for Strings. The Washington, D.C. native, in 1996, became the first Black composer to win a Pulitzer. The elegiac music poured out of the players in rich, intermingling layers.   

But the band couldn’t leave on a somber note, so it closed with a rambunctious interpretation of the finale to Ravel’s string quartet — an appropriately effervescent way to say goodbye.  

SET LIST
Haydn: String Quartet, Op 33, No. 5: Scherzo        
Beethoven: String Quartet, Op. 130: Presto

61q6JoGLTc0,Conrad Tao And Caleb Teicher: Tiny Desk Concert,"Tom Huizenga | November 3, 2023
A tap dancer and a pianist perform Bach and Gershwin behind a desk in our office: What could possibly go wrong? You can't tell by these truly electrifying performances, but an hour before this Tiny Desk began, I was chasing a tow truck to a salvage yard. The person slated to deliver our tap floor was snagged in a multi-car pileup that, thankfully, left nobody injured. I rented a U-Haul, grabbed the floor from the totaled vehicle and floored it back to NPR.

The behind-the-scenes headaches were worth it when we stood in awe of these two artists — pianist Conrad Tao and dancer-choreographer Caleb Teicher — as they created an experience so unexpectedly fresh and suffused with joy, it moved some to tears and others to cheer for more.

Bach and tap dancing might, on the surface, have nothing in common. But here, with ecstatic energy, the artists literally bring out the spirit of dance inherent in Bach's music, as Teicher's artful clicks and clacks weave into the multi-voiced counterpoint.

Catching a breath, the two slow it down with a sensual piece composed together. Teicher buffs the floor with softer shoes while Tao taps out light, Chopin-perfumed harmonies. High voltage gusto returns in Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue. Tao's athleticism, rising from the bench with blistering runs, nearly rivals Teicher, whose constant inventions, Charlie Chaplin charm and pretzel-like flexibility create a cinematic flair.

Former prodigies, Tao and Teicher feed off of each other's virtuosity. Presented with genuine delight, the performances left them exhausted and the audience gobsmacked.

1acyepjN0OE,Arlo Parks: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | November 1, 2023
Watching Arlo Parks read an excerpt from her newly published book of poetry, The Magic Border, during her performance, it felt like a full circle moment for her. Her origins as a musician began with poetry, but she also explained between songs that Tiny Desk concerts also planted seeds during her formative years as an artist. ""This session is generally one of the reasons that I decided to make music and I grew up with this session, so it's really special to be here.."" Three years ago, with just a guitar in tow, she recorded a Tiny Desk home concert. Two albums later, she's made it official behind the real Desk, this time with a full band to back her up.

Aside from ""Eugene"" from her Grammy-nominated, Mercury Prize-winning debut album, the entire set is comprised of cuts from her sophomore album, My Soft Machine. The drum loops and breaks hit hard on My Soft Machine, but these stripped-down versions deviate just enough to allow her voice to sit at the forefront. Whether speaking or singing, the British singer-songwriter puts me at ease and eloquently articulates relatable emotions in ways a mere layman couldn't imagine. At 23 years old, her poetic, feelings-first approach to music continues to set her apart from so many others in her class and I'm excited to hear how this coming-of-age story continues to evolve.

Cx8AaSvH4EQ,Shakti: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | October 30, 2023
It's hard to get past the significance of this performance by the Indian jazz fusion band, Shakti. Initially formed in 1973 by jazz guitarist John McLaughlin with virtuoso traditional Indian musicians, the band opened the doors for others to expand their musical appreciation beyond Western music. 50 years later, as guitarist McLaughlin reunites with tabla player Zakir Hussain to take Shakti on another world tour, the group stopped by for a magically inspiring performance behind the Tiny Desk.

""Shrini's Dream"" sets the stage with both melodic and rhythm instruments, before vocalist Shankar Mahadevan, violinist Ganesh Rajagopalan and McLaughlin each take turns calling out to the muse for inspiration. The entire set is a drummer's dream given Hussain is considered a master tabla player both within and outside the tradition.

Shakti's music has always been built around complex traditional rhythms and they are on full display with Hussain and Selvaganesh Vinayakaram. The band was born in the aftermath of McLaughlin's Mahavishnu Orchestra and ""Lotus Feet"" channels that band's hypnotic exploration of time and melody, while the aptly titled ""Bending the Rules"" mixes Indian traditions and the custom of jazz musicians trading licks back and forth, bringing this historic moment to an energetic close.

pRERgcQe-fQ,Nile Rodgers & CHIC: Tiny Desk Concert,"Sheldon Pearce | October 25, 2023
Before Nile Rodgers & CHIC set the Tiny Desk off, the icon established a sort of mission statement for the group's sound: ""If we can funk in this, you know we can funk."" They surely can. In stints since 1972, CHIC has assured its position as funk ambassadors — a position its members clearly relish — and no space is resistant to their grooves. When Rodgers asks singer Kimberly Davis to show the audience ""how we do it in the CHIC organization,"" she launches into high-powered vocals that vaporize every note. And when he asks drummer Ralph Rolle to lead them to ""maximum funkocity,"" Rolle ignites call-and-response with an electrified crowd. As the ringleader of the CHIC experience, Rodgers crams a lifetime's worth of nightlife into every strum of his guitar.

Rodgers' career is epic in both scope and impact. The 1979 CHIC album Risqué was a disco milestone that became a hip-hop cornerstone. Standing at inflection points for two different genres is enough to make a career, but Rodgers was far from done. An incomparable songwriter and session musician, his call sheet as a producer is emblematic of his immense range: David Bowie, Diana Ross, Madonna and Mick Jagger, just to name a few. His work is embedded in the very fabric of popular music, and he continues to add to his resume decades after first making changes to the sonic landscape. In 2014, Rodgers won the Grammy for record of the year with Daft Punk. This year, he amassed more honors for his work on Beyoncé's RENAISSANCE.

His wondrous set spans his massive catalog — songs he wrote for CHIC, songs he wrote with collaborators, songs he wrote for other stars and a surprise song he wrote for a classic movie. Throughout, Rodgers is the pulse for an ever-amplifying funk. The band's performance of ""I'm Coming Out"" builds to a rip-roaring sax solo. A rollicking performance of ""We Are Family"" breaks down in the middle before erupting to a triumphant finish. And atop the rippling bassline of ""Good Times,"" Rodgers breaks into an impromptu version of ""Rapper's Delight,"" which samples the song. It all leads to the maximum funkocity of Bowie's ""Let's Dance,"" a tribute to the genre's reach and power.

qj_LkwXiAoM,Nora Brown and Stephanie Coleman: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | October 24, 2023
There's a sweet moment between songs when Nora Brown and Stephanie Coleman reminisce about their love for traditional banjo and fiddle tunes. Speaking about 'Across the Rocky Mountain,"" banjo picker Nora Brown says she first heard the song when she was about 10 or 11.  That puts a grin on fiddler Stephanie Coleman's face, as she chimes in to say, ""I had the same experience; we both were middle schoolers who were obsessed with old banjo players."" It's this passion that these two have for traditional tunes that sparks me as a listener, and the audiences that come to see them. It's a body of work that's been handed down from player to player for centuries.

Tiny Desk fans may remember first meeting Nora Brown a few years back, when this 10th grader performed a Tiny Desk (home) concert thirty feet below the surface in Brooklyn. Now, with her musical soulmate, the two perform a few songs behind my desk from their recently released EP, Lady of the Lake, including the title track and ""Copper Kettle."" 

I think it's safe to say that none of the original creators of these tunes could have imagined a world where this music is so easily accessible. This music still feels inspiring, with emotions of yearning and joy that are still central to our being.

RcINbc0ye-o,Jordan Ward: Tiny Desk Concert,"Ashley Pointer | October 23, 2023
Jordan Ward showed up to NPR headquarters radiating with a warm energy that felt familiar, like linking up with your favorite cousin at the cookout. After all, the immense amount of creativity and synergy displayed by Ward and his bandmates during this Tiny Desk performance is indicative of pure fellowship.

The St. Louis bred singer-songwriter started his professional career as a backup dancer for stars like Justin Bieber and Becky G. Since carving out his lane in music, Ward has been steadily on the rise and dropped his stellar debut album, FORWARD earlier this year. He's an effervescent presence in R&B and this Tiny Desk concert traverses an array of his most beloved musical moments, directed by producer Lido on vintage synths and backed by PG county's own Alex Vaughn on vocals.

Ward opened his six song set with a dreamy soundscape before diving into his 2021 song ""Lil Baby Crush."" And when Lido cued the unmistakable synth lines from ""WHITE CROCS,"" they turned up the energy in a Tiny Desk arrangement of the already classic tune. Closing out the show on a sweet note, Ward serenaded the audience with a bossa nova-infused arrangement of ""CHERIMOYA,"" and you can't help but wonder how so much talent can exist in one person.

Maluma, baby. Literally.

The Colombian superestrella's debonair smile and mesmerizing vocals were as captivating as ever during his El Tiny performance, yet nothing could draw the spotlight away from the three little words proclaimed boldly across his chest: ""Papa de Paris."" Of all the titles Maluma has donned — Don Juan, Papi Juancho — none have ever been worn with more pride.

Maluma on becoming a new dad and using music to defy stereotypes about Colombia
""Esa cancion ... se la compuse a alguien y es bien bonito tenerlas aquí,"" the singer said in Spanish, teasing the announcement of his soon-to-be-born baby girl ahead of a teary-eyed performance of ""ADMV."" Mama, who was present in the crowd, was clearly center-stage in the artist's brain as he cast loving glances in her direction throughout the emotional set.

Tears didn't stop Maluma from bringing in the hits, from notorious banger ""Hawái"" to recent regional record-breaker ""Según Quién,"" he showed off his stylistic diversity and vocal dynamism by laying smooth melodies over a rock solid band featuring a string section and masterful percussion.

As a surprise extended ending to our heritage month celebration, Maluma closed things out in true Latino fashion — with pride, tears and familia.

5WG_-0Qh3kc,Smokey Robinson: Tiny Desk Concert,"Mitra I. Arthur | October 16, 2023
Legend is a word thrown around far too often. But if there was ever an artist the word ""legend"" applies to, it would be Smokey Robinson. The iconic songwriter, producer and vocalist was not only a key architect of the Motown sound, but also R&B and soul music as a whole. His uncanny ability to craft tender and catchy romantic tunes has served as a model for songwriters that followed in the decades since he began his career.

1981's ""Being With You"" opens the Tiny Desk to immediately alert us that, at 83 years young, his sweet and sensual falsetto is present and ready to dazzle. From there, he casually introduces one of his numerous hits with The Miracles, ""The Tears Of A Clown,"" as ""one I wrote with Stevie Wonder"" to the audience's delight. Robinson's pen game is still strong as he presents two tracks from his new album, Gasms. His romantic lyricism is on display in ""Beside You,"" and the sax solo from Brandon Wright in ""If We Don't Have Each Other"" is a particular standout in this performance. And when he closed with ""Cruisin',"" the audience was more than happy to lovingly participate in ""cruising together.""

FftvVi42U4o,Becky G: Tiny Desk Concert,"This Latinx Heritage Month Tiny Desk is celebrating with an 'El Tiny' takeover, featuring a wide array of artists from all corners of Latinidad.

Felix Contreras | October 13, 2023
The Tiny Desk had a considerable pop sheen when vocalist Becky G took her place alongside a backing band featuring a string quartet. The stripped down sound of some of her biggest hits offered a rare view of her artistry.

""BAILÉ CON MI EX"" is the perfect example of an unforgettable hook. It had the NPR staff audience bopping in place for what she described as a ""warm up"" for the rest of her set. ""MAMII"" was originally recorded with Karol G, but performed alone, and the Tiny Desk version was no less a scorcher. Here, interplay with guitarist Justice West at the beginning set the temperature for a slow burn.

The showstopper is her duet with vocalist DannyLux, ""CRIES IN SPANISH,"" a song they did together on her latest album, Esquinas. I have to admit that when he started his part of the song, it was apparent that their voices were kind of made for eachother. And by the time she obliged us with her Tiny Desk concert take on ""Shower,"" she had cast her spell: I ended up singing that chorus for the rest of the day.

7EAM4pxxL4Y,Ivy Queen: Tiny Desk Concert,"This Latinx Heritage Month Tiny Desk is celebrating with an 'El Tiny' takeover, featuring a wide array of artists from all corners of Latinidad.

Stefanie Fernández | October 11, 2023
""La gente tiene la patita del conejo / y yo tengo a Benito completo,"" Ivy Queen quips, lighting a candle featuring Bad Bunny at an El Tiny altar to reggaeton (""People have the rabbit's foot / I have all of Benito."") Even her jokes flow. Thanks to far more than luck, ""La Caballota"" has carried and passed the torch since the '90s with an ironclad sense of self and unwavering commitment to the women and femmes she writes for.

And she's done it in no uncertain terms. After a propulsive performance of ""La Vida es Así,"" she soberly says that women are judged no matter what. For a long time, she was the most visible canvas upon which projections of women in reggaeton were placed, and her talent was nurtured from within. ""Yo sabía que a mi no había que darmela porque yo la tenía,"" she later notes. (""I knew that it didn't have to be given to me because I had it."") The road has widened, not without a struggle.

Finally, she addresses the mujeres directly for the song. ""Tenemos derecho a ser feliz, tenemos derecho a cambiar, a cuidarnos, a protegernos,"" she exhorts. (""We have the right to be happy, we have the right to change, to take care of ourselves, to protect ourselves."") ""Quiero Bailar,"" two decades later and literally performed behind a desk, feels as urgent and insurgent now. Or, as she puts it, simply: ""Guys, this is for the girls."" With Ivy Queen, it always has been.

JmnZHQNN5cc,Caroline Polachek: Tiny Desk Concert,"Marissa Lorusso | October 10, 2023
Any good singer who gives half a thought to the health of her instrument knows that hydration is crucial for functioning vocal cords. But when Caroline Polachek — whose left-of-center pop music makes great use of her mellifluous voice — stops for a water break in the middle of her Tiny Desk concert, she doesn't pull out some crappy plastic bottle. No, she drinks from a chalice.

That seems like precisely the right vibe for a performance by Polachek. Her songs are filled with vivid, extravagant imagery — headless angels, smoke floating over volcanoes, fiery sunsets, mayflies in the swimming pool — and in their production you can hear everything from a children's choir to bagpipes to glitchy beats. At the Tiny Desk, she maintains that adventurous spirit but works with a live band to give her songs a more homespun feel. Together, they perform four tracks from Polachek's arresting, maximalist album Desire, I Want To Turn Into You: the propulsive ""Pretty In Possible""; the romantic ""Blood and Butter""; ""Sunset,"" which gets a group clap-along from the assembled NPR staffers; and ""I Believe,"" which Polachek and the band transform from a stuttering synth-driven track to an acoustic reverie.

Listening to Polachek's recent records, you might be tempted to think her vocals are drenched in pitch correction software. Haters may say it's AutoTune, but when she sings live and unamplified in the NPR Music offices, it's clear that the impressive range and control you're hearing is all her.

RxhleZbLF64,Villano Antillano: Tiny Desk Concert,"This Latinx Heritage Month Tiny Desk is celebrating with an 'El Tiny' takeover, featuring a wide array of artists from all corners of Latinidad.

October 6, 2023 | Isabella Gomez Sarmiento

Villano Antillano kicked off her Tiny Desk Concert with a Britney Spears-approved message: Dump. Him.

""Yo Tengo un Novio,"" off the Puerto Rican rapper's debut LP, La Sustancia X, called out the toxic, controlling expectations of one of her ex-jevos. Through her sharp Caribbean flow, Antillano broke down the confines of monogamy in her first song before casting light on drug use and escapism as a means of queer survival in ""Kaleidoscópica.""

Throughout her performance, Antillano showed why she's one of the most exciting voices in Latin trap and reggaeton right now. She flaunted her sexual prowess on ""Cuero,"" and ""Cáscara de Coco,"" then intentionally honored her religious upbringing and place in the church, which she noted isn't always a welcoming space for LGBTQ+ communities. The artist keeps proving that socially conscious lyricism and unfiltered joy can — and should — go hand-in-hand.

A3ThZptD8WY,Alex Cuba: Tiny Desk Concert,"This Latinx Heritage Month Tiny Desk is celebrating with an 'El Tiny' takeover, featuring a wide array of artists from all corners of Latinidad.

Felix Contreras | October 4, 2023
Alex Cuba starts his turn behind the Tiny Desk with the barest of musical essentials: a percussive guitar rhythm, the soft scratch of a güiro and a miniature choir. ""Ciudad Hembra (La Habana),"" a lament for his hometown, sets a deliberate slow burn for this performance.

Alex Cuba's superpower is his undeniable charm as he weaves evocative imagery into musical arrangements that not only call to mind his native Cuba but anywhere an acoustic guitar and engaging voice command attention. ""De Camino'' offers a good case in point. Propelled by bass, drums and congas, the deeply personal love song is full of celebration — Cuba's guitar and light hand percussion remind us that we are, in fact, in the Caribbean.

""Chekere"" is named for the Afro-Cuban instrument made of a dried-out gourd covered by beads used in all types of Cuban music. The song's soft beginning evolves into a percussion-inspired explosion before Alex Cuba segues into a delicate love song dedicated to his wife, ""Sarah.""

L_BHC2l30pY,Sam Smith: Tiny Desk Concert,"Stephen Thompson | September 29, 2023
What you've got here is a perfect 20-minute distillation of The Sam Smith Experience: The Grammy-winning 2014 ballad that kicked off the singer's career (""Stay With Me""), a sleek dance-pop banger (""How Do You Sleep"") and a chart-topping dollop of debauched hedonism (""Unholy"") bundled together with ""Lay Me Down,"" in which Smith performed a gorgeous duet with LaDonna Harley-Peters. From the stately to the louche and bawdy — Smith even introduced ""Unholy"" with a perfect summation of their recent artistic direction: ""Let's get saucy!"" — it's all here.

Performing with an 11-person choir and two instrumentalists — sadly, Kim Petras wasn't there to emerge from between Smith's legs as if she were being birthed — Smith brought an overflowing bag of tricks to the proceedings. But what really shone through was a sense of movement: Each song swayed and played effervescently, centering Smith while also elevating every other magnificent voice in support. This set may not serve as anyone's introduction to the music of Sam Smith, but it's still a hell of a gateway — and a joy to behold.

AynDvSkZ8og,DannyLux: Tiny Desk Concert,"This Latinx Heritage Month Tiny Desk is celebrating with an 'El Tiny' takeover, featuring a wide array of artists from all corners of Latinidad.

Stefanie Fernández | September 27, 2023
""Amar y perder es mejor que nunca haber amado,"" DannyLux sings — ""To love and lose is better than to have never loved."" His reflection is hushed and hesitant, and, maybe even more wisely, a little unconvinced: ""Crеo que no entiendеs / Que esta situación me está cambiando,"" he croons. (""I don't think you understand / That this situation is changing me."")

He's really good at laying these paradoxes out plainly. But seated at 'El Tiny' between his cousin Eddy on bass and lifelong friend Victor also on guitar, the quiet 19-year-old is grounded and sure, looking back on his childhood and the daydreams that led him to become a sierreño star. Between each song, he notes a piece of his story, from being born in Palm Springs, Calif. to his parents' favorite music to writing songs in his room after his siblings left home. The Chicano singer has experienced a dizzying ascent to fame since his TikTok star rose in 2020, infusing a variety of Mexican regional genres with a distinctly online moodiness and honesty. He sings straightforward lyrics for unsimple feelings; his tender performance of ""TE EXTRAÑO Y LO SIENTO..."" captures the closeness of those feelings as they're unfolding.

For his last surprise, the trio expands to include two charchetas for closer ""ATRAPADO,"" a joyful rendition of a truly sad song; exquisitely, the horns hit right on the word ""obsesionado."" For someone whose music is so centered around yearning, Danny's performance is incredibly present, grounded in this moment of community with all the attendant gratitude and wonder that comes with a sound and artistic identity forged with family and friends.

Anamaria Sayre | Septemeber 22, 2023
J Noa buzzes with power. Standing cara a cara with the 17-year-old Dominican rapper, it's clear that spinning life experiences into buttery smooth, striking bars is as natural for her as it is for most of us to take a breath.

This Tiny Desk concert was her first time ever leaving her barrio to perform, and yet she transmitted the confidence and charisma of an artist who invokes generations of fuerza into every word she breathes. Setting the tone with ""No Me Puedan Parar,"" she brought captivating energy to the cool anthem. Switching to ""Autodidacta,"" she backed her self-taught narrative with mind-blowing verbal sprints. Gliding through the jazz-backed ""Paranoia"" to story-driven ""Betty,"" her delivery was so powerful that even the stories she told in between tracks felt like carefully placed poetry.

Desde el DR para romper el Tiny Desk. Don't get it twisted — J Noa came to the Tiny Desk to show the world what a girl from her barrio is capable of. Respira, romper — desde DR pa el mundo, the world isn't ready for her.

AFgWCQZDoCI,Wicked: Tiny Desk Concert,"Josh Rogosin | September 21, 2023
Stephen Schwartz, the composer and lyricist of Wicked, quipped about his creative process at the Tiny Desk: ""Tell the truth, and make it rhyme.""

If you want to know how to write the fourth longest running show on Broadway, look no further than the Wicked Tiny Desk. The show is celebrating its 20th year in New York. After seeing it, I knew I had to invite the two leads and the show's composer to play his memorable score in our office.

The story of Wicked is a reimagining of The Wizard Of Oz, adapted from the 1995 novel by Gregory Maguire. Since Winnie Holzman and Stephen Schwartz adapted it for the stage, it has been performed all over the world and translated into six languages.

The performances at the Tiny Desk by Alyssa Fox (Elphaba) and McKenzie Kurtz (Glinda), defy gravity. To sing these songs well, they must be acted well. And to see these performers do so in front of their composer at the piano is thrilling. The actors celebrate their sisterhood, beaming as they perform these familiar songs.

CbotsXwCbNE,Rawayana: Tiny Desk Concert,"This Latinx Heritage Month Tiny Desk is celebrating with an 'El Tiny' takeover, featuring a wide array of artists from all corners of Latinidad.

Isabella Gomez Sarmiento | September 19, 2023
This Latinx Heritage Month Tiny Desk is celebrating with an 'El Tiny' takeover, featuring a wide array of artists from all corners of Latinidad.

No Venezuelan party is complete without tequeños. Whether it’s a wedding or a baptism, the cheese-filled treats are a must-have at every snack table — so it makes sense Rawayana pulled up to “El Tiny” with a box to share.

Kicking things off with hits from the band’s 2016 album, Trippy Caribbean, the Caracas-formed group brought its infectious energy and beach-infused sound to the NPR office. The reggae-groove that defined early songs soon turned into something more expansive, putting a Caraqueño spin on funk, merengue, rock and hip-hop. Rawayana’s set — which included two singles from the forthcoming album, ¿Quién trae las cornetas? — perfectly illustrated how the band’s sound stretches and plays off of musical movements from around the Caribbean diaspora to create something new altogether. 

For more than a decade, Rawayana has been at the forefront of a younger generation of Venezuelan artists that grew up under the country’s socioeconomic crisis. At its Tiny Desk performance, it showcased just how much talent has come out of Venezuela during that time — bringing friends and collaborators like Apache, Irepelusa, Orestes Gómez, Joel Martínez and Eric Chacón to perform — and how much joy and gozadera is still left in store.

k0zSUBzIWhc,Indigo De Souza: Tiny Desk Concert,"Hazel Cills | September 13, 2023
It's not exactly typical for artists at the Tiny Desk to share their future burial plans, but that's exactly what Indigo de Souza does halfway through her performance. ""I wrote this song about my love for nature,"" the singer-songwriter says, introducing the track ""Not My Body."" ""I think that when I die ... what I want is to be composted and to become soil, and for that soil to be used to plant a tree, and I want that tree to be so big and strong.""

""I don't know what kind of tree yet — still thinking on it,"" she says, with a few giggles from the audience. ""A tree that people can visit and be like, 'This is Indigo!' Until they die and they can't visit me anymore.""

It's beautiful, unvarnished sentiments like that — a desire to be reborn as a big and strong redwood tree — that mark de Souza's lyricism. The 26-year-old songwriter's music always emits a certain nakedness, as she chronicles the unknowing that often comes from being in your 20s. In a set built from 2023's All of This Will End, here these songs come paired with horns as her soaring vocals move seamlessly through beats of youthful despair and hope.

pnISpahN2dM,Hiromi: Tiny Desk Concert,"Suraya Mohamed | September 8, 2023
Hiromi arrived at NPR wearing comfortable sweats, her chic hair already styled and perfectly coiffed for the performance. A keyboard gig bag was strapped on her back with her Nord Lead A1 analog modeling synthesizer, a versatile instrument loaded with her programmed patches. Its buzzy, modular sound started the show with a funky melodic line that sets up this highly energetic and joyful set.

Just before this performance, she and her band ""Hiromi's Sonicwonder"" had just finished recording their soon to be released new album, Sonicwonderland. They perform two songs from that project here, and each one is its own auditory adventure, filled with sophisticated arrangements and lush textures. Adam O'Farrill's trumpet playing is exquisite, as he sometimes routes his horn sound through pedals to create an ethereal tone. Hadrien Feraud thumps his bass lines with precision and grit as he locks in really tight with Gene Coye's crisp and momentous drum performance.

You can see how much fun Hiromi is having here, her beautiful smile beams as she rips her small but strong hands up and down multiple keyboards. She moves seamlessly between the three instruments, sometimes standing, sometimes sitting, sometimes dancing — always breathtaking. Her whole body generates an observable power that's also playful and virtuosic. She plays with great command but yet she is also at ease, as her notes ripple from her fingertips like streams of water.

bRq66Rtwms0,Anne Akiko Meyers: Tiny Desk Concert,"Tom Huizenga | September 7, 2023
When violinist Anne Akiko Meyers walked into NPR headquarters, I half expected her to be flanked by bodyguards. After all, she was carrying a very rare instrument. Her Guarneri del Gesù “Vieuxtemps” violin, built in 1741, is worth at least $16 million. Instead, Meyers arrived only with a pair of publicists and the perceptive pianist Max Levinson. She seemed nonchalant about the fact that her fiddle is worth a fortune.

What matters, naturally, is how the instrument sounds and few can make a violin sing as sweetly as Meyers. The San Diego native was already performing on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson at age 11. Three years later she enrolled in New York’s Juilliard School and at 18 cut the first of her 40-some albums.  

A devoted champion of contemporary composers, Meyers opens with music by Philip Glass, who is currently writing a piece for her. The violin and piano arrangement of his “Metamorphosis I” oscillates between tranquil, long-held notes and flurries of arpeggios, while the piano toggles on mournful chords.

“The Swan,” the hit single from Camille Saint-Saëns’ 1886 Carnival of the Animals, follows gracefully. Meyers’ diaphanous performance is a master class on how to achieve a rich tone with light bow pressure. The luxurious, low end of the Guarneri is spotlighted on Dirait-On, a gentle choral work from 1993 by Morten Lauridsen, which closes this set of unhurried, contemplative music.

Meyers may drive a hot rod violin worth millions, but it takes a true artist to handle the instrument and bring out its singular voice.

oIeqO2tyhcY,Chlöe: Tiny Desk Concert,"Suraya Mohamed | September 5, 2023
Chlöe Bailey and her band were scheduled to fly in the day before this show. But with thousands of flights delayed or canceled at the start of the 4th of July holiday weekend, one member couldn't make it into town. Because the arrangements were designed for two background vocalists, it didn't make sense to have just one and the team decided the ensemble would go without.

But you would never know something was missing here. Chlöe filled the room with a stunning vocal performance, her positive spirit and light radiated throughout the entire room. The band exuded a special energy too. Right from the first note, they locked into a groove that felt really good. ""Surprise,"" a hit from 2022, started out the set with a sexy bump and grind, R&B vibe that segued right into the body-popping ""Body Do."" Next up was ""I Don't Mind,"" an afrobeat-infused party jam that really demonstrates her wide vocal range.

The party mood stayed strong with ""Worried,"" another favorite from her 2023 debut album In Pieces. Its reflective title track speaks to Chlöe's transparency around being vulnerable. She said, ""A lot of times I've been broken down and the cracks will be left, but that doesn't make me imperfect or it doesn't take away any beauty I have deep inside."" That lovely disposition continued into the last song, ""Cheatback,"" a reminder that even if we think of seeking revenge, karma matters.

Ten years ago, sometime after Speedy Ortiz transformed itself from a Sadie Dupuis solo project into a functioning rock band, its jagged and clever early singles caught the attention of NPR Music's Lars Gotrich. So we reached out to inquire about a Tiny Desk concert, only to learn that the timing wasn't quite right: The group didn't have any days off and its members were concerned they wouldn't sound their best, so they responded to our request with a question of their own. ""Can we do it later?""

Now, Speedy Ortiz is celebrating the 10th anniversary of its debut album, Major Arcana — and finally making good on that offer to come back another time, though it should be noted that Dupuis' side project Sad13 did play a killer Tiny Desk (home) concert back in 2020. But this set stands as a definitive Speedy Ortiz time capsule, bringing together band members of the past and present while capturing one song from each of the group's four albums: ""The Graduates"" (from 2015's Foil Deer), ""Scabs"" (from the new Rabbit Rabbit), ""Lucky 88"" (from 2018's Twerp Verse) and ""Plough"" (from Major Arcana). It's truly a performance 10 years in the making, not to mention an ideal showcase for the band's wiry, eternally quotable charm. Even the stuffed bunnies seem impressed.

xkWdU-WeGFw,Christian McBride's New Jawn: Tiny Desk Concert,"Suraya Mohamed | August 30, 2023
The start is chaotic for sure, but that's the intent. Two minutes of craziness is an accurate description of the intro and outro of ""Head Bedlam."" ""A sonic description of us looking at Twitter particularly during the pandemic,"" leader Christian McBride explains after the first tune of his Tiny Desk set, ""when you put your phone down, that's when the groove starts.""

The groove is funky too. For almost eight years, McBride and his bandmates — trumpeter Josh Evans, Marcus Strickland on woodwinds and drummer Nasheet Waits — have been playing exploratory post-bop music without a polyphonic instrument — one that can easily play more than one note at a time — like a piano or a guitar. This makes for a genuinely distinct sound, one that's less dependent on strict harmonic understructures and more creative interplay between instrumentalists.

Strickland wrote the soulful second song, ""Prime,"" which is also the title track to the group's second album released earlier this year. You can hear each player's personality shine through their instruments as they support one other with an impeccable demonstration of the call and response method. Towards the end, Waits' explosive drum solo is quite extraordinary.

The last song, ""Walkin' Funny"" is a bluesy swinger from the band's first album. McBride anchors the piece with his signature thumping bass style and a fantastic solo — just try and tap your foot along with the crazy meter changes that are unpredictable but fun.

jjA7vj3_Htk,Yahritza y Su Esencia: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | August 24, 2023
If you close your eyes at the beginning of this Tiny Desk concert, you could easily imagine yourself at a party somewhere along the Texas-Mexican border around the 1930s, just after the guitars come out. But open your eyes and you'll see Yahritza y Su Esencia, a trio of musicians from Washington's Yakima Valley, belting out songs about lost love and longing.

Such is the magic of the current wave of Mexican regional music. Yahritza Martínez's voice on ""Soy El Unico"" speaks to a new generation of Mexican music fans as deeply as some of us old timers. Surrounded by her brothers Armando, on 12-string guitar, and Jairo, on bass, Martínez's impassioned vocals speak of loving someone who does not return the favor. There is an art to singing the kind of impassioned lyrics that are found in the corridos and rancheras of the best Mexican regional music and Yahritza does it again on ""Dejalo Ir,"" another song she wrote when she was 13 years old.

I was doing okay until the group hit its stride with ""No Se Puede Decir Adiós"" when I had a moment. My mom loved rancheras and corridos and having recently lost her, I had to sit down at my desk during the performance and have a private, quiet cry. So don't hold back, and give yourself up to the powerful emotion of Yahritza y Su Esencia's performance.

Bm5anO_Yd2s,Sarah Cahill: Tiny Desk Concert,"Tom Huizenga | August 18, 2023
Pianist Sarah Cahill commands a near godlike status among fans of contemporary classical music. She's commissioned dozens of new works from today's top composers including John Adams, Julia Wolfe and Terry Riley. But when she sat down at the piano behind Bob Boilen's desk, she was focused not so much on new music but instead the plight of women composers.

While compositions by women are being heard slightly more often in concert halls over the past three years, historically the numbers have been pitiful. (In the 2018-19 season, both the Philadelphia and the Chicago Symphony Orchestras presented music by 55 different composers — none were women.)

Cahill is doing her part to remedy the situation. For this performance, she offers a sampler of The Future is Female, her multi-volume project that collects piano music by a staggeringly wide swath of women composers over a four-century span.

A spirited prelude by the short-lived Czech composer Vítězslava Kaprálová opens the set. She managed to write some 50 works before her death in 1940 at age 25. What a contrast to the fascinating, quirky music of Emahoy Tsegué-Maryam Guèbrou, the Ethiopian nun who lived to age 99. Poised for a career as a concert pianist, she turned to religious life and later wrote music in a singular style that includes off-kilter waltzes, odd syncopations, Ethiopian Orthodox chant and whiffs of blues.

Cahill looks back to the 17th century for dance music by Élisabeth Jacquet de la Guerre, a favorite of Louis XIV, and caps off the set with a piece she commissioned from the Chicago-based composer Regina Harris Baiocchi, a bittersweet poem for piano titled ""a candle burns time.""

In an age when the average person would still be hard-pressed to identify a single woman classical composer, Sarah Cahill has plenty of important names to choose from.

(""Presentiment,"" by Emahoy Tsege Mariam Gebru, courtesy of the Emahoy Tsege Mariam Music Foundation, a self-financing non-profit that funds music education for underserved children in the U.S and Ethiopia.)

Rmg040Su5R8,Omar Montes: Tiny Desk Concert,"Anamaria Sayre | August 17, 2023
Shrouded in all black, flamenco garb and flanked by his very own angelitos at the Tiny Desk, Spanish singer Omar Montes is the shining embodiment of the contrasts he constantly plays with. 

Dancing along the border of tradition and modernity — flamenco and hip hop — the artist recounts his story as a kid of Roma heritage growing up on the streets of Madrid, over the melodic heartbeat of clapping hands. Opening the show with “Patio de la Cárcel,” he trades synthetic beats for transitive horns and lays bare his soul with vivid bars about life in his barrio. Locking in his audience with a heart-thumping trombone line, he switches to flamenco-driven “Metió en un Lío.” Settling back into the beat of clapping hands, he and his band dance through the up-tempo “La Llama del Amor.” 

Omar Montes walked into the building on a video call with his grandma — one of the most important people in his life. He closes out his performance with “Conmigo,” infused with the kind of romance you’d imagine his abuela taught him. “For you I would bring down the moon,” he coos. The Spanish artist exudes tradition and soul as he centers his barrio, his people, his familia in his show — bringing a little piece of Spain to the rest of the world.

oCcks-fwq2c,Post Malone: Tiny Desk Concert,"Stephen Thompson | August 15, 2023
The Tiny Desk has hosted plenty of major pop, rock and hip-hop stars in its 15-plus years, but you'd be hard-pressed to find one more agreeable or self-effacing than Austin Richard Post. Whether lamenting the state of his singing voice, joking about his nerves or sitting slack-jawed in awe of the fantastic band his people had assembled for this show, Post had the bearing of a lottery winner who wouldn't even give himself credit for buying a ticket.

Before, during and after the show, Post Malone was a joy to have around. But he also just happened to bring a few of the biggest pop hits of the 21st century: Set-opener ""Sunflower,"" for example, has been certified eighteen-times platinum by the RIAA since its release in 2018 — that's an all-time record — while the 2017 single ""I Fall Apart"" and 2019's ""Circles"" lag behind at a mere ten-times platinum apiece. ""Enough Is Enough,"" which closes this set, enjoys no such designation, but give it time: A track from Post Malone's new album Austin, it's only been out for a few weeks.

So enjoy this set for what it is: one of the world's biggest stars, performing a few of the world's biggest songs, each set to a luminous arrangement. Post Malone himself seems surprised by how great this Tiny Desk concert sounds, and that's not just the humility talking.

Lti5hj6dyPc,Little Dragon: Tiny Desk Concert,"Mitra I. Arthur | Aug 11, 2023
The last time Swedish band Little Dragon performed for Tiny Desk, the group wasn't actually at the Desk. Like a number of Tiny Desk alum who played between 2020 and 2022, Little Dragon delivered its debut Tiny Desk as a (home) concert in the band's Gothenburg studio. That performance provided a comforting balm to many during the early and confusing months of the global pandemic. Finally hosting the quartet in our Washington, D.C. office was the ultimate goal, and in this in person Tiny Desk, Little Dragon delivers a performance awash with upbeat and optimistic melodies balanced by a grounded presentation.

Since the band's debut album in 2007, Little Dragon created a blend of R&B, soul, electronica and dance pop that pushes the boundaries of simplistic genre classification. The whimsical whistling of drummer Erik Bodin in ""Tumbling Dice"" is the perfect complement to singer Yukimi Nagano encouraging us to ""make it worth every step as we go."" The cosmic pop tones of ""Ritual Union'' are stripped away here, and the driving beat in this slowed down rendition heightens the contemplative lyrics on marriage. ""Gold,"" from the band's newest album Slugs of Love, is a standout in this set. The verses build to a funky, thumping bassline, courtesy of Bodin and bassist Fredrik Wallin, anchoring a chorus that interpolates the Whitney Houston tune ""Million Dollar Bill.""

Keyboardist Håkan Wirenstrand delivers flowing embellishments and solos on every track, particularly in the last song of the set, ""Where You Belong,"" from 2020's New Me, Same Us. Nagano's honeyed vocals make the song simultaneously mournful and hopeful, as she touches her hand to her chest, reminding us our lost loved ones have ""been there all along, right where you belong.""

CUN8pdgA0m8,Action Bronson: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | August 8, 2023
There are times during Action Bronson's Tiny Desk when his vocals momentarily drift. We instruct our guests to face the directional microphones so that our recorders clearly pick up the voices. Action warned us of the improbability of that happening before we started filming and sure enough, the Flushing, Queens emcee strolled off mic a couple of times, did an about face here and there and even took a knee mid-show. By the time we got to ""Latin Grammys,"" he looked over to our engineer Josh Rogosin and said, ""I told you I couldn't stand still. How do you play music still?"" He's got a point.

Action's band Human Growth Hormone reinterprets his records so funky, it's nearly impossible not to move, yet the small imperfections during the set tickled me. Bam Bam, primarily known as a rapper, has turned his passion for food, clothing, sneakers, wrestling, writing, fitness and painting into bonafide professions. Never veering too far away from the booth, he's consistently dropped projects since 2011. After working out in the green room, Mr. Baklava walked to the Desk, greeting nearly every person in the room with a handshake, and proceeded to perform highlights from Mr. Wonderful, Lamb Over Rice, White Bronco, and Only For Dolphins. Bronson was born to entertain us.

O0sUBp7ps8k,Gregorio Uribe: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | August 4, 2023
One of the many musical manifestations of the history of Latin America is the arrival of the European accordion. And in the hands of Colombian musician Gregorio Uribe, the accordion is both a melodic and rhythmic wonder. As he launches into ""Damasco"" with his two musical partners, Jonathan Gomez on percussion and Andres Garcia on bass, images of the lush Colombian countryside push through the bright melodies of the accordion and Uribe's impassioned vocals.

The performance is an explosion of both folkloric vallenatoand cumbiaand. as Uribe explains, the lively rhythms can often defy the seriousness of the lyrics — he describes ""Atlas""as an existential crisis set to a very danceable rhythm. ""Media Naranja"" explodes into a percussive jam session and ""Ay Leonardo"" evolves into a joyful singalong as Uribe demonstrates how the spirit of Colombian folk music becomes universal in the right hands.

ILOnnEW2iRg,Obongjayar: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | August 2, 2023
When I got downstairs to greet Obongjayar and his bandmates at NPR headquarters, they had already found their way over to some stationary bikes near the lobby to get the adrenaline pumping. OB and crew seemed shy but ready for this moment. During the show, I witnessed my colleagues go from wiping away tears to bouncing and clapping within a matter of minutes. That emotional balance is Obongjayar’s Tiny Desk in a nutshell. He gave us everything. 

The Nigerian-born, London-based Steven Umoh beelined it straight to the desk to dial in with the band. His towering presence, juxtaposed with a high-register tone that sometimes dips into a low growl, simply commands attention. I first learned of Obongjayar through Little Simz. He was featured on “Point and Kill,” which they performed for a Tiny Desk home concert in 2021. The following year, he dropped his debut album Some Nights I Dream of Doors. While most of the set focused on the best of Some Nights…, he also plays the newly released “Just Cool” before closing with the awe-inspiring protest cut, “Message in a Hammer.”

ptMLdzijCrc,Peter One: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | July 27, 2023
Peter One's tender voice has a storied past. His opening song, ""Cherie Vico,"" the one that hooked me on his music, is a love song sung in Guro, the language of his homeland Ivory Coast in West Africa. He tells the NPR crowd, ""That's where I started playing music a long time ago. I came to America in 1995 and I moved to Nashville a few years ago. So far, I've been working as a nurse, but now I'm back to my passion: music as my career.""

These are passion-filled songs often with references and connections to his past. ""Birds Go Die Out Of Site"" tells the story of a friend also from the Ivory Coast and now living in America, who wants to go back home. ""It wasn't the right time because the 2010 elections in the Ivory Coast were still causing some political problems,"" Peter One said. ""My friend didn't listen to me. He went anyway. I got a phone call. My friend had died."" And with a Southern blues tone, complete with harmonica, guitar, pedal steel and backing singers, Peter One continues the tale.

Peter One's songs shift from English to French to Guro. The two instrumentalists, Agustin Escalante and Luke Schneider (he was last here with Margo Price), are from Nashville, while the singers are from nearby the D.C. area. All the songs performed are from the 2023 album Come Back to Me, which brings him back to stardom after 30 years away from music. His last number is about reconciliation with his people of the Ivory Coast, but I can't help but think of his personal reunion with his inner soul.

LJdWpAFutYM,Kany García: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | July 24, 2023
What's an artist to do when, instead of standing and dancing before a stadium of adoring fans, she's instead sitting behind the Tiny Desk?

You do exactly what Puerto Rican vocalist Kany García does: dig deep into the intimacy of her songwriting and the musicality of one of the most distinctive voices in any form of Latin music.

The first track, ""Para Siempre"" perfectly embodies a seductive declaration of togetherness with lyrics like: ""I want to be the desire that brings you home every night."" In ""Mundo Inventado,"" the full power of her songwriting has me lost in my feels, as she sings of the plight of all immigrants everywhere who leave the known for the unknown. (Where is my tissue? I have something in my eye.)

She closes the set with her song whose profane title can't be written out fully but is as common as the sound of traffic across Latin America: ""DPM (De Pxta Madre)."" In García's masterful hands it becomes a colorful way to express the ups and downs of emotions of even the briefest romantic episode.

If there was ever any doubt that García brings the skills of one of the best lyricists of Latin America to the world of Spanish pop music, this performance proves it. It feels like she is singing her very personal messages of desire and longing just for me.

Uh, I mean, for all of us.

tUApO77uUUk,Cypress Hill: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | July 20, 2023
The first thing I noticed as Cypress Hill strolled into NPR headquarters was Sen Dog cradling his signature bucket hat. I asked him if my assumptions were correct; it was indeed the original hat seen in all the videos from the early '90s. Before I could process that confirmation, B Real asked me, ""Yo, is your greenroom a greenroom?"" We got everything we expected and more from Cypress Hill at the Tiny Desk.

While the term ""pioneer"" is used loosely in pop culture today, few terms describe Cypress Hill's impact over the past three decades more adequately. They are the first Latino hip-hop group to achieve platinum and multi-platinum status. B Real, Sen and producer DJ Muggs crafted a sound in the '90s that stretched beyond regional boundaries. It was dark, psychedelic and at times directly addressed mental health before the topic was commonplace. Many dismissed the group as ""stoner rappers,"" yet the members were fervent advocates for the legalization of weed long before it came to fruition.

Touring members Eric Bobo and DJ Lord joined the duo along with Money Mark from Beastie Boys fame. The band summoned a horn section to fill out this rare minimalist approach to five, funky Cypress Hill things. Between each song, B Real took his time to shed some historic light on the group's journey thus far.

YiBVIG9n-d8,Sparks: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | July 18, 2023
It's hard for me to comprehend what a newcomer to Sparks would make of seeing brothers Ron and Russell Mael for the first time. Ron, the mustached one behind the keys, looks like he once was a silent film star and just fell off the silver screen (and is a bit grumpy about it.) On the other hand, Russell, with his upbeat posture, sings about a girl crying in her latte. Hopefully, by the time Russell introduces us to the second tune, about a 22-hour-old child seeing the world and wishing to go back to whence he came, the innocent viewer/listener will understand the twisted humor Sparks has been dispensing for over 50 years across a few dozen albums.

When the duo's first records came out in the early 1970s, I managed a record store and played the albums on our turntable. Sometimes it would drive away customers (Sparks are an acquired taste), and other times it would kindle new friendships. I'd have never dreamed that Sparks would be making music all these years later, let alone playing at my office desk. And I also could not have imagined that the band's latest album, The Girl Is Crying In Her Latte, would be as good as ever. After three new songs, Sparks takes one dip into the past, ""a Sparks golden oldie,"" as Russell puts it. With a great band behind them, Ron and Russell played the song ""This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us,"" bringing unimaginable joy to me and hopefully to those just discovering Sparks.

6CNFF0Ql0ME,GWAR: Tiny Desk Concert,"Lars Gotrich | July 17, 2023
As the band of intergalactic monsters strapped guitars to their battle-worn bodies, thunder and rain pounded the NPR building outside. As if the late Oderus Urungus was pissing his blessing from Valhalla, the prophecy had finally been fulfilled: GWAR came to destroy the Tiny Desk once and for all.

On Feb. 15, 2020, a parody news site ran the headline: ""GWAR asks NPR's Tiny Desk Staff if They're Ready to Get Their A******* Ripped Open."" My text messages suddenly blew up. Is this real? No, it's literally fake. Can this be real? Little did they know I'd already been talking to one of the group's underlings since 2019 to bring the Scumdogs of the Universe to the office of seltzer and sensibility.

For nearly four decades, GWAR has terrorized planet Earth with its gratuitously blood-soaked stage shows and grotesque satire. The interplanetary warriors have made comic books, beer, BBQ sauce and, um, adult toys. But, most importantly, GWAR has written some of the raunchiest, silliest and hookiest heavy metal songs, four of which were performed at the Tiny Desk to a giddy audience. No heads were decapitated, but Blöthar the Berserker and Pustulus Maximus did invade All Things Considered afterward to part from NPR with these immortal words: ""CDeez nutz.""

-XppUz4SkLk,Alice Sara Ott: Tiny Desk Concert,"Tom Huizenga | July 14, 2023
When Alice Sara Ott walked into our Tiny Desk office space she was fascinated by all the knickknacks and doodads musicians have left on the shelves over the years. She immediately got to work, folding an origami swan, which would be her own contribution. But first, it was given pride of place atop our trusty Yamaha upright — a talisman of good things to come.    
 
“Music is timeless,” the 34-year-old German-born pianist told the audience. And to prove it she served up nearly 200-year-old music by Chopin mixed with a contemporary work that looks back in time by the Canadian composer, pianist and genre-buster Chilly Gonzales. “If we perceive music as old, dusty and elite, or if it feels modern, relevant and inclusive to us, depends so much on the context,” Ott added.

Chopin, whose cycle of Opus 28 Preludes dominate the set list, still sounds remarkably relevant today. Ott opens with a hurricane of passionate anguish in the Prelude No. 24 in D minor. She stabs at the music’s final inky black notes, like pounding nails in a coffin. What follows couldn’t be more contrary: the Prelude No. 7 in A major Ott describes as charming and innocent, like a “fragment of a memory.” Gonzales’ own Prelude in C sharp minor has Bach in the rearview mirror and yet looks out ahead toward ambient music and minimalism. Without pause, Chopin’s famous “Raindrop” Prelude, with those insistent, nervous droplets, caps off a concert by a thoughtful pianist willing to inject a full measure of emotion into music that demands it.  
 
SET LIST
Chopin: Prelude Op. 28, No. 24

btiE3ASfUUE,MARO: Tiny Desk Concert,"Anamaria Sayre | July 13, 2023
As captivating as birds who sing in sync, MARO's guitar trio brought an almost imperceptible, natural beauty to her Tiny Desk, characteristic of an artist truly in her element.

It makes sense that the Portuguese guitarist and singer-songwriter would feel at home in this space given her previous visit to the Desk as a featured player and vocalist in Jacob Collier's Tiny Desk concert. Beyond that, the artist came ready-made for the platform, prepared to lay bare a transfixing expression of bilingual heartbreak, strung together by the seamless narration of three acoustic guitars.

Opening with ""há-de sarar,"" the singer invited the listener to participate in her journey of heartbreak with sing-songy guitar harmonies and gently ebbing Portuguese vocals. Transitioning to ""just wanna forget you,"" MARO reminded the audience of the raw emotionality of her lyricism, trading languages to emphasize the melancholic guitar rhythms, weaving a tale she suggested most can relate to. Finishing with ""can you see me?"" and ""I SEE IT COMING,"" she encouraged everyone to join in singing, inserting whatever lyrics or sounds they felt compelled to add.

At every stage of her performance, she reminded the listener that regardless of language, culture or place, within a few weeping guitars and mesmerizing vocals lies some deeply and universally felt truths.

1hMxG92KTGE,Lisa O'Neill: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | July 11, 2023
Drones abound, and a pensive atmosphere filled the office when Lisa O'Neill and her bandmates began one of my favorite songs of 2023, ""Old Note."" The deep, harmonic drones comprise a bowed hammer dulcimer, a shruti box, a harmonium and a bowed upright bass. Then the Irish singer's plaintive voice tells a tale she describes as ""orality"" and ""how we communicated before we started writing stuff down. It's a song also about hearing the music in nature.

There are many ways to conjure joy with music. Some aim for party music, with uplifting beats that get your body moving, but Lisa O'Neill walks a different path. For her joy is about connecting with the plants, the animals, and our surroundings and feeling grateful for the world around us.

The songs performed here come from her 2023 album All of This Is Chance. The music is stark and cerebral, the voice singular and personal with few flourishes, and I find it captivating. With all the weight of stories and song, there are moments of cheer, especially on the one non-album track, ""When Cash Was King."" Here, we're talking robots and King Charles and a nod to the cusp of change we witness daily.

m9jHZ_pa2PM,Meridian Brothers: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | July 7, 2023
You gotta love a band that names itself after siblings that don't exist, and under a name that doesn't match anyone in the band. At least I do.

I've been a fan of the edgy sonic traditions of the Meridian Brothers for a while now, and jumped at the chance to bring the duo's space age cumbia direct from Bogotá, Colombia to the Tiny Desk. And band leader Eblis Alvarez did not disappoint.

Right from the start, the band's cumbia-infused grooves floated beneath almost otherworldly electronic keyboard sounds in ""Guaracha U.F.O.,"" eventually incorporating Alvarez's signature, sly ""I know something you don't""-style vocals. It's easy to be tricked by the eccentricities of the instrumentation and the offbeat vocal stylings, but Alvarez is a man with a vision, using his vast knowledge of Colombian folk and pop music to do things like pay tribute to an imaginary salsa band that never existed, as he did on its last album.

Things were very real during the group's turn behind the Desk, as he and his band challenged the audience to bring along what they knew to meet him in his world of recycled beats — played by his dedicated crew of Colombian musicians — off-kilter vocals and imaginative storytelling lyrics on ""¿Dónde Estás María?""

He and his band pulled off a powerful version of ""Bomba Atómica"", a sort of calling card that speaks to Alvarez being influenced by the rich history of Colombian cumbia and surf rock guitar, for a song that is essentially a frantic warning of the end of the world. Alvarez acknowledged the audience's appreciation with two raised fists, as if to celebrate how the real world dipped their toes into his realm of the imaginary, and everyone was better for it.

KUm6f0QJ_FI,Omar Sosa & Seckou Keita SUBA Trio: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | July 5, 2023
We've had hundreds of different voices and instruments behind the Tiny Desk over the years, but to my ears the performance that featured Omar Sosa and Seckou Keita sounded as if it was dropped directly from the heavens of musical compatibility right into our laps.

From the very start of ""Allah Léno,"" the notes began to sprinkle down like soft snowflakes from Sosa's piano and Keita's magnificent 24-string West African kora, while percussionist Gustavo Ovalles' tasteful drumming percolated beneath the interplay of Sosa and Keita. Proving once again that the Tiny Desk space is sacred ground for musical inspiration, barely four minutes in, Keita ended an inspired run with a huge smile acknowledged by his bandmates as well as those lucky enough to be in the NPR Music offices that day.

The title of the second song ""Kharit"" means ""friendship"" in the Senegalese language wolof and it starts with Ovalles' spellbinding, rhythmic work with traditional Venezuelan maracas. It starts at a relaxed pace but picks up speed with intuitive interaction between Sosa and Keita.

The last song ""Maam"" is devoted to ""all mothers,"" a sentiment that cuts across borders. This is truly an international band with Sosa hailing from Cuba, Keita from Senegal and Ovalles from Venezuela and the song titles are a mix of Arabic and west African wolof. And for about twenty, glorious minutes, the Tiny Desk was a weigh station along an ancient musical route connecting our imaginations with the vision of a truly remarkable trio.

kes2P4IC2bQ,Juvenile: Tiny Desk Concert,"NPR Music is celebrating Black Music Month with an array of brand new Tiny Desk concerts. Together, these artists represent the past, present and future of Black music. This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk's unique way of showcasing that talent.

Bobby Carter | June 30, 2023
""WTF is a Tiny Desk and no!"" are the words that led to one of the most publicized journeys any musician has taken to get to NPR headquarters. That was Juvenile's response to Twitter user @theylovemyke's request for him to play a Tiny Desk concert back in April. His response ignited Black Twitter, launching a barrage of tweets and reposts of favorite performances at the Desk, as fans implored the ""T.C. soldier"" to reconsider. His viral reconsideration led to a few DMs, which led to a few phone calls, and the date was set. Juve, like some rappers in his class, had never heard of our little nook in Washington, D.C., but he soon found out.

The pressure to deliver was palpable in the planning stages but as the band was assembled, my expectations were exceeded. Tiny Desk alumni and New Orleans natives Trombone Shorty and Alvin Ford were brought into the fold. Another Tiny Desk vet from New Orleans, Jon Batiste, flew in from London just to be a part of the set. Juvenile sourced The Amours from right here in D.C. to handle background vocals, along with string players from the Louisiana Philharmonic for the grand finale. The architect of the Juvenile/Cash Money Records sound, DJ Mannie Fresh, became the glue that pieced it all together. The result was one of the most rambunctious experiences at the Desk. The Hot Boy coasted through highlights from a decades-long, groundbreaking career, concluding with a performance of ""Back That Azz Up,"" so exuberant that the audience demanded an encore and the band obliged. A Tiny Desk first.

lW2cUz9Gz94,Brandee Younger: Tiny Desk Concert,"NPR Music is celebrating Black Music Month with an array of brand new Tiny Desk concerts. Together, these artists represent the past, present and future of Black music. This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk's unique way of showcasing that talent.

Mitra I. Arthur | June 28, 2023
On a beautifully ornate harp and clad in a stunning yellow printed catsuit, Brandee Younger starts her Tiny Desk with a composition dating back to the 1900s — “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” colloquially known as the “Black National Anthem” — then transitions into the title track of her newest album, Brand New Life. This particular transition between past and present is fitting as Younger, like harpists Alice Coltrane and Dorothy Ashby before her, has made a career of showcasing the role of the harp, a classical instrument dating back to antiquity, in not only contemporary popular music, but moreover, in music genres rooted in Black culture: jazz, R&B, and hip-hop. 

As she reflected after her Desk on being included in NPR Music’s celebration of Black Music Month, Younger remarked: “When you think of harps and harpists, you don't necessarily think of ‘Black’. And so to be a part of that conversation as a harpist, it's a big deal.” Her collaborations range from Robert Glasper and Makaya McCraven, to Moses Sumney, Ms. Lauryn Hill and Pete Rock. Compositions from her 2021 album, Somewhere Different, garnered her a Grammy nomination for best instrumental composition — the first for a Black woman —  and an entry on NPR Music’s 100 Best songs of 2021 list.

For her Tiny Desk, Younger presents some of her newest entries into the jazz harp canon. “Brand New Life” and “Moving Target” feature vocalist Tatiana “LadyMay” Mayfield’s ethereal voice perfectly complimenting the transcendental tones of the harp, which is expanded into a one woman choir of sound through the use of vocal pedals. Younger closes with “Unrest I” and “Unrest II,” composed during the height of both the COVID-19 pandemic and 2020’s Black Lives Matter protests. In these two movements, Younger, drummer Allan Mednard and bassist Rashaan Carter stunningly convey a maelstrom of tension, confusion, upheaval and release, emotions undoubtedly present in many who similarly witnessed a world in confusion outside their windows at this time.

I was certain that we'd never fit 14 musicians — playing winds, strings, piano, bass and even a vibraphone — behind Bob Boilen's desk. But the members of the new music ensemble Wild Up, with their can-do attitude and their effervescent artistic director Christopher Rountree, were completely amenable to being shoved and squeezed and finally fanned out just right in front of our cameras and microphones.

They traveled all the way from California to play a single piece by a composer to whom Rountree and his musicians have devoted their lives for the past few years. Wild Up has just released its third album of music by Julius Eastman in a projected seven-volume series. Eastman was proudly Black and proudly gay, revered in his short heyday of the 1970s and early '80s, but tragically misunderstood and nearly forgotten by the time of his death in 1990, alone in a Buffalo, N.Y. hospital at age 49.

Today, as Eastman's music is being brought into the spotlight by Wild Up and others, he's celebrated as an experimental visionary who brandished his own provocative way of getting the listener to think about sound and context.

For this performance, the band plays a 15-minute arrangement of a longer piece from 1973 called Stay On It. The music is nothing less than an exuberant house party unto itself, infectious and revelatory.

To perform Eastman's works, Rountree says, can be transformational.

""They're the kind of pieces you breathe in as a musician, and they do their work on you,"" he explains. ""And when you breathe them out again, you're breathing not only the piece but also a different version of yourself.""

C47H4mOq6Ho,MUNA: Tiny Desk Concert,"Stephen Thompson | June 23, 2023
“It’s very cool to see that everyone who works for NPR is gay,” MUNA singer-guitarist Katie Gavin deadpanned by way of introduction at the band’s Tiny Desk concert. For a band whose latest album is currently soundtracking its second straight Pride Month, MUNA has found a deep kinship with queer audiences — a fact Gavin noted during the lead-in to a country reworking of 2021’s irresistible “Silk Chiffon.”

“We love being queer, and we find a lot of joy in it,” she said. “We think, like, if the world is gonna change in the way that it needs to, it’s very important for our revolution to be based on joy, and what brings us joy, and chasing after that.”

“Silk Chiffon” embodies that idea, but it’s also deepened by the version MUNA unveiled here: As its melody was transformed by a string-infused arrangement, it revealed a clear undercurrent of yearning only hinted at in the original.

Expanded into a septet, MUNA used the setting as an opportunity to lean into its moodier side. “Loose Garment” placed Naomi McPherson at the piano as Gavin applied subtle effects to her own plaintive voice. And “Stayaway,” a highlight from 2019’s Saves The World, placed such a demand on the three voices at MUNA’s core — Gavin, McPherson and Josette Maskin — that they practically exploded with relief when it was over.

MUNA’s appearance happened to coincide with a loosening of pandemic restrictions at the Tiny Desk — most notably the hard cap on the number of audience members who could attend. It was hard to miss the sense of liberation, and the surge of energy, in the sheer size of the crowd.

gGyP2VGUQMY,Amaarae: Tiny Desk Concert,"NPR Music is celebrating Black Music Month with an array of brand new Tiny Desk concerts. Together, these artists represent the past, present and future of Black music. This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk's unique way of showcasing that talent.

Sidney Madden | June 22, 2023
“I think we’re in the groove now,” Amaarae laughs to her bandmates midway through her Tiny Desk concert. As one of the few breaks she takes in a 20-minute set, the singer-songwriter uses this pause to check the energy and drip of her musical consiglieres. While Amaarae and her soprano command attention in a distressed, rust-colored trench and corset top, the 11-piece band compliment their star by rocking t-shirts of the same color palette embroidered with standout lyrics from the songs she’s performing; “See my essence, feel my blessings,” “Wasted eyes on you”, “I like coffee with some head in the morning.” 

It's this level of intention, precision and playfulness that has gotten the Ghanaian-American artist to her Tiny Desk moment. As a writer, her searing wordplay beckons with confidence that’s cooler than the other side of the pillow. As a producer, her ear for opposites-attract rhythms create singular moments on any chart they grace. As a Tiny Desk performer, the sunny, juicy jam of “Big Steppa,” acoustic imagining of “Disguise” and extended jubilance of “SAD GIRLZ LUV MONEY” are anchored by Amaarae’s knowledge that she’s serving up something so forward-facing, it’s incomparable. 

Born in the Bronx but hailing from Accra, Ghana, Amaarae’s appearance on NPR Music’s Black Music Month lineup proves how far the sounds of West Africa have stretched to influence the U.S. and, more implicitly, just how much the music defies catch-all labels like ‘Afrobeats.’ Fountain Baby, the album that’s home to most of the songs Amaarae performs at the Desk, represents what she does best. While it may be categorized as “pop” by streaming services, as an experience, Fountain Baby is an overflowing stream of genre-swerving liquid dopamine, lulling and surprising its listener in waves. Pulling influence from a grab bag of global incantations, Amaarae makes African percussion flirt with baile funk and alté, pop punk and garage, resulting in one of most triumphant albums and Tiny Desk Concerts of 2023 so far.

kjJnal0XtN8,Ambré: Tiny Desk Concert,"NPR Music is celebrating Black Music Month with an array of brand new Tiny Desk concerts. Together, these artists represent the past, present and future of Black music. This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk's unique way of showcasing that talent.

Ashley Pointer | June 20, 2023
""I had to represent for New Orleans, ya heard me?"" Ambré says nearly midway through her Tiny Desk concert before turning to show the back of her spray-painted t-shirt, revealing a classic photo of rapper Juvenile from his Cash Money era.

Everything Ambré does is intricately detailed, intentional and unapologetically New Orleans. The singer-songwriter, producer and multi-instrumentalist creates music that's psychedelic, soulful and takes you on a journey. With her band decked out in Dickies fits and surrounded by magnolias, the rising star invites us into her world for a performance that pays homage to the culture of her hometown and its legends.

Accompanied by a dynamic band composed mostly of Tiny Desk alums, Ambré sets the tone with ""3 Peat,"" from her sophomore EP 3000º. The EP is a salute to NOLA's finest — Lil Wayne and Juvenile, who'll be closing out our Black Music Month celebration. She then smoothly transitions into ""Wild Life..."" a love letter to the 504 before hitting ""plenty"" and ""band practice"" from her debut EP Pulp.

It was only right that she closed out the show with ""I'm Baby,"" perhaps her most beloved track and her first No. 1 entry on the Billboard R&B charts. The recording of this performance couldn't have come at a better time — she found out she was nominated for the BET Awards for Best New Artist right after the shoot, all while gearing up to release her follow-up EP who's loving you?, which is out now. If this Tiny Desk happens to be your introduction to Ambré, be prepared to be enraptured.

1tKE6A3uA64,Adam Blackstone: Tiny Desk Concert,"NPR Music is celebrating Black Music Month with an array of brand new Tiny Desk concerts. Together, these artists represent the past, present and future of Black music. This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk's unique way of showcasing that talent.

Nikki Birch | June 16, 2023
Adam Blackstone captured the essence of Black Music Month when he said during his Tiny Desk concert: ""In order to pay it forward, you have to pay it back..."" That sentiment was the spirit of his performance, a multi-genre celebration of the legacy of Black music.

If you're not familiar with Adam, if you've watched The Voice, where he was an advisor, The Masked Singer or even Rihanna's Super Bowl LVII halftime performance, for which he was music director, I assure you you're already acquainted with his brilliance. The multi-instrumentalist, producer and songwriter is musical director to the stars.

The set opened with a surprise collaboration. Adam's mentor, the legendary DJ and producer Jazzy Jeff, joined the band and sprinkled in the jazz bop, ""Brother J,"" with one of the key elements of hip-hop: the scratch.  Then Adam introduced one of his favorite vocalists, Blakely, who captivated the office with a heartfelt rendition of Thelonius Monk's ""'Round Midnight."" The jazz vibe continued with a silky smooth composition by trumpeter Melvin Jones called, ""The Storm Will Pass.""

Taking time to reflect on his early career, Adam shared how one session with a certain artist changed his life. To the surprise and delight of those gathered, that person was none other than Musiq Soulchild, who performed two of his hit songs, ""teachme"" and ""Just Friends (Sunny).""

This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk's unique way of showcasing that talent.

Ashley Pointer | June 14, 2023
It's practically a sin to not have Durrell ""Tank"" Babbs on your spiciest playlist — he's penned some of the steamiest records in R&B. If you've been following our Black Music Month takeover, it's likely you spotted Tank accompanying Babyface, the love maestro himself, on background vocals. In his own concert, the veteran crooner and R&B scholar performed a 14-song medley of passionate love songs and bedroom bops from across his 23 years-long career in music, and turned the Tiny Desk into ""the big, nasty Desk.""

This doesn't happen without warning: ""Some of these songs make you wanna make up. Some of these songs make you wanna breakup and some of these songs make you want to participate in various sexual activities,"" Tank declared before traversing his catalog. Backed by the phenomenal Florida-based MVP Band, along with a trio of famed background vocalists — singer-songwriter-actor Luke James, singer Brooke Valentine and songwriter/producer Lonny Bereal — we got a taste of the songs that not only established Tank as a pillar in R&B, but hits he wrote and produced for other notable artists such as Jamie Foxx, Omarion, Marques Houston and LeToya Luckett.

Full of buttery smooth runs and yearning melodies (along with the occasional, witty HR joke), Tank's Tiny Desk concert is a stellar display of how powerful the allure of R&B can be, and perhaps a masterclass for any youngin' learning how to woo.

I was working late when Kenneth ""Babyface"" Edmonds first arrived at the office to rehearse for his Tiny Desk concert. Within moments, it was clear it would be an exceptional performance. The next day, my colleagues waited patiently to see the legendary singer, songwriter and producer. Because when it comes to matters of the heart, Babyface has turned our angst, our triumphs, our devastation, into timeless love songs that have scored the romances of more than one generation.

Joined by top-tier talent — Tank, Chanté Moore and Avery Wilson — Babyface came out swinging. From the songs that put him on the map, to those he wrote or produced for other icons, around the room hit after hit was met with swoons, sighs and not a few tears. (Ok, maybe that was just me.)

Babyface is a titan of the music industry: with numerous top 10 hits, 12 Grammys (50 nominations) and a jaw-dropping roster of collaborations. In 2022, he assembled a stellar ensemble of women for one of my favorite albums of the year, Girls Night Out. To watch this master of pen and sound behind the Tiny Desk was truly epic and nothing short of a dream come true.

J3jUEB7qmt8,Charlie Wilson: Tiny Desk Concert,"NPR Music is celebrating Black Music Month with an array of brand new Tiny Desk concerts. Together, these artists represent the past, present and future of Black music. This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk's unique way of showcasing that talent.

Bobby Carter | June 5, 2023
Charlie Wilson's Tiny Desk unexpectedly ran the gamut of emotions. His musical journey boasts some of the highest highs and fanfare for over 50 years. So much so, it's easy to forget what he's endured. His testimonial during a praise break reminded us that he's climbed through valleys about as deep as they get. ""I went from rags to riches, riches to rags, then rags to the curb, the curb to homeless,"" he said. ""Because I was an alcoholic and a crack cocaine addict! But I'm 28 years clean and sober!""

Flanked by a host of musicians, Wilson expressed the depth and breadth of his life and career, telling a tale of two Charlies. The Oklahoma native's success with The Gap Band, formed with his brothers Robert and Ronnie, began in the 1970s and stretched throughout the '80s. The group's many hits are classified as old-school funk and R&B, but it's the resurrection and connection with young hip-hop stars that make Charlie's story so compelling to me.

Snoop Dogg was the first to hop on board, coining him ""Uncle Charlie"" and featuring him on his second LP, Tha Doggfather in 1996. They've been frequent collaborators since, eventually landing the smash, ""Beautiful,"" a few years later. From Kanye West to Tyler, The Creator, Nas, and more recently Don Toliver and Devin Morrison, Wilson has been hip-hop's secret sauce for decades. When I asked Uncle Charlie to explain the reason why he's such a draw in hip-hop, he said so much by simply stating: ""I can sang!""

1Wg2huulil4,Unknown Mortal Orchestra: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | June 2, 2023
Unknown Mortal Orchestra's Tiny Desk concert was more of a family affair than lead singer, Ruban Nielson, revealed during his band introductions. His father, jazz musician Chris Nielson, has been on tour with them to support the band's latest album, V. During the band's live show back in April at the 9:30 Club in Washington, D.C., he casually drifted on stage, played the saxophone for a song or two, then drifted back off. Following that performance, Chris had travel plans that would've prevented him from making it to NPR. I begged them to reconsider the routing and they obliged. Chris, sax in tow, stayed put for the entire set along with Kody Nielson on drums rounding out the Nielson trio. Keyboard player Christian Li and longtime UMO member Jacob Portrait on bass make up the current roster.

The setlist leaned right into UMO's incalculability. The band decided to forgo material from V to play songs from the first couple of albums, a rare move at the Desk that speaks to the strength of UMO's catalog. The opening number, ""From the Sun,"" lacked the density of the recorded version but punched way harder. Ruban and the gang then shifted into a clever medley of oldies from II, Multi-Love and their self-titled debut.

G0ljnXV-q40,NIKI: Tiny Desk Concert,"NPR Music's Tiny Desk is celebrating Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. These artists represent just a sliver of the cultural diversity that exists within the Asian American and Pacific Islander community.

Stephen Thompson | May 31, 2023
NIKI, a.k.a. Nicole Zefanya, took a circuitous route to the Tiny Desk. Born in Jakarta, she scored a major opportunity by winning a competition at 15 to open for Taylor Swift when her Red Tour took her to Indonesia. After moving to Nashville and building a following as a YouTuber, NIKI released two EPs and an album (Moonchild), then moved to L.A. and landed her song ""Every Summertime"" on the soundtrack to the Marvel blockbuster Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings: The Album. Our own Bobby Carter heard that track and fell in love, and soon enough, NIKI and her band were breaking in the latest instrument in our in-house Tiny Desk collection: a light-blue toy piano.

That li'l piano figures prominently in ""Backburner,"" the song that opens NIKI's Tiny Desk debut, but these songs also reflect a more serious side. ""The Apartment We Won't Share,"" which the singer says ""sort of laments the loss of an unlived life with somebody,"" recalls the weightier reflections of Taylor Swift, while ""Before"" tells the specific-but-relatable story of a long-distance love that falls apart before it can get fun. But NIKI closes her set on a breezy note, as she and her band swim in sleekly soulful, '70s-singer-songwriter vibes throughout ""Every Summertime."" The story of a love that grows and evolves with each passing summer, it had Bobby and the rest of us swaying, swooning and swimming in high hopes for the weeks and months to come.

6PgYuit1BXw,"Little Moon, 2023 Tiny Desk Contest Winner: Tiny Desk Concert","Bob Boilen | May 30, 2023
When 2023's Tiny Desk Contest winner Little Moon arrived at NPR, outward expressions of joy overshadowed the inner bundle of nerves this Springville, Utah band felt. The group's winning song, ""wonder eye,"" unanimously wowed our contest judges Sharon Van Etten, Baby Rose, Sudan Archives and Albina Cabrera. Tiny Desk senior producer Bobby Carter and I, also judges, were in awe hearing singer Emma Hardyman's 4-octave voice warming up behind the Desk. She and her husband, Nathan Hardyman, told NPR's All Things Considered host Ari Shapiro that they began writing ""wonder eye"" while Nathan's mother was in hospice care, and that he wrote the lyrics soon after she passed. ""'wonder eye' incorporates the idea of multiple deaths,"" Emma shared. ""I think it took the physical death to help us realize that death is really happening all the time — be it past versions of ourselves, old held beliefs, old judgments even. And to that extent, we're always grieving as well, which was also eye-opening.""

Without monitors or vocal amplification, one of the toughest things for a band to do when playing at my Desk is to get the balance and sound levels right. Emma and Nathan, joined by bandmates Bly Wallentine on bass, Bridget Jackson on harp, Chris Shemwell on drums and Grace Johnson on keys, all pretty much nailed it. The band's set, which includes two unreleased songs (recorded for a new album), displays a range of emotion and creativity with a promising future. The group will be hitting the road as part of the Tiny Desk Contest tour, so if Little Moon is coming to your town, come and hear this band's unique sound.

6bALUVyGZh0,Anna Tivel: Tiny Desk Concert,"Ann Powers | May 22, 2023
“We’re gonna play you a story,” the Oregon-based singer-songwriter Anna Tivel says, introducing “Black Umbrella,” her searing ballad about police violence in an American convenience store, during this quiet and riveting performance at the Tiny Desk. As the keyboardist Galen Clark adds grace notes supporting gently unyielding guitar, Tivel sings of a young bystander who, because of the way he looks, is transfigured from witness to a crime to alleged perpetrator and, finally, its most tragic victim. “Black Umbrella” is the epic at the broken heart of Tivel’s exquisite 2022 album Outsiders, which like all of her music chronicles the lives of the overlooked, misunderstood and vulnerable. As always, Tivel’s remarkable empathy elevates her folk-based, jazz-touched compositions from mere stories to secular prayers.

Sometimes Tivel is the vulnerable one. “What if flying doesn’t take, and we’re alive only to ache?” she sings in the closer “Royal Blue,” a song to a best friend that’s as unguarded as it is hopeful. Her ease here with Clark and the drummer Micah Hummel, whose gentle embellishments complement Tivel’s modest ways, comes from much time in their van, crossing continents. Inside their swirling arrangements, Tivel’s portraits of pain and resilience become hypnotic, like dreams, like reality as we cope with it, always unfolding. “Is there something that you want to say?” she intones in the new and unreleased song “Fluorescence in the Future.” Thing is, Anna’s already said it.

ZRThiGArHxQ,Kimberly Akimbo: Tiny Desk Concert,"Josh Rogosin | May 19, 2023
The day before the 2023 Tony nominations were announced, the cast, band and composer of the musical Kimberly Akimbo climbed out of their bus and shuffled behind the Tiny Desk. That's no easy feat for nine cast members, four bandmates and a composer wielding a glockenspiel.

Kimberly Akimbo (with title character played by Broadway star Victoria Clark) is a coming-of-age story about a 16-year-old girl with a rare genetic disease, which causes her to age four times faster than normal. The show is funny, sad and uplifting all at once. It's a family affair with songs sung by Kimberly's aunt, parents, love interest and friends.

For the transfer to the Tiny Desk, composer Jeanine Tesori led the audience through a playlist of four standout musical numbers, making sure to shout out her collaborator, playwright David Lindsay-Abaire. After opening with Bonnie Milligan's Tony-nominated performance of ""Better,"" Tesori asked her cast and band to introduce themselves. Justin Cooley, who plays Kimberly's first crush, could not make it to the Desk. The composer-turned-emcee used the opportunity to thank all understudies who work tirelessly to ensure that the show must go on — even at a desk in a Washington, D.C. office.

e4WrRKSgGI0,Lewis Capaldi: Tiny Desk Concert,"Jill Britton | May 17, 2023
“I just wanted to take a moment before we start to say — lower your expectations,” Lewis Capaldi told the audience before his Tiny Desk performance. He then immediately launched into a beautifully crafted, vocally stunning four piece set.

Beginning with a special arrangement of “Before You Go,” Capaldi was flanked by a full band, including two horns — something new for the Scottish singer. His second song, “Wish You the Best,” is the latest, Capaldi-style heartbreaking single from his upcoming album Broken by Desire to Be Heavenly Sent. Capaldi joked that he didn’t have much to say about the exclusive premiere of his next song, “Heavenly Kind of State of Mind,” describing it solely as simply being three minutes long. 

If you didn’t know anything about Capaldi before watching his Tiny Desk, the self-deprecating humor mixed in between gut-wrenching vocal ballads will quickly catch you up to speed. Capaldi had NPR’s audience in tears, both from laughing at sexually suggestive jokes about the size of the Desk and lyrics about the complexities of moving on after a relationship ends. “What happens now?” Capaldi asked the Tiny Desk team as he wrapped up “Someone You Loved,” the final song of his set. Time to put the video on repeat and grab a tissue box.

D8UWsFMVj_Q,Karol G: Tiny Desk Concert,"Anamaria Sayre | May 15, 2023
Arriving at the Tiny Desk not long after becoming the first female artist to have a Spanish-language album top the Billboard 200 chart, Colombian singer Karol G shined brighter than ever. With an all-female crew backing her, the proud energia femenina and the prowess of a band dominated exclusively by women is undeniably brilliant here. It was also the first time in many years, she said, that she hadn't rehearsed without her typical on-stage equipment, like in-ear monitors. ""I forgot how cool it feels,"" she said. Authenticity isn't a prescription for Karol G, it's a natural state — something that she carries with her, waiting for the next opportunity to reveal another version of Carolina.

""CAROLINA,"" her given name, was also the title of the opening track of her performance, as she got to jamming in a manner atypical for the superstar. Trading her flute and trumpet for an accordion and tuba she ""bring[s] some Mexican vibe to this place,"" she said, with ""GUCCI LOS PAÑOS."" She paused between songs and offered a cheers to the room, admitting that she had meant to sip her Mezcalito before the previous song.

She emphasized the rawness of the moment by slowing things down for a stripped down, reggae-leaning version of ""PERO TÚ."" Sliding seamlessly into a bossa nova-esque ""MERCURIO"" — the version she wishes she'd included on the album — ""La Bichota"" brought the music back up and danced herself off stage. Away from the stadium lights, Karol G's performance wasn't just a blip of normalcy for the pop star — it was permission from the self-described ""happy-heartbreak girl"" to get up, whether in the streets of Medellín or an office in Washington, D.C., and dance with every version of yourself.

z6QNNxCf-3s,"Arooj Aftab, Vijay Iyer, Shahzad Ismaily: Tiny Desk Concert","Nate Chinen | May 12, 2023
Around the midpoint of Arooj Aftab, pianist Vijay Iyer and multi-instrumentalist Shahzad Ismaily's Tiny Desk concert as the trio Love in Exile, Aftab steeply intensifies her vocal outflow, generating a spirit of lift within the music. It's the cresting of a wave, in a sense, but no more inherently vital than the accumulating swell period, or the ensuing glide. For Aftab and her equal partners in the project, every musical offering arises from a slow-motion flutter of collective actions, which renders each passing moment unique.

That's a fanciful way of saying what the music invites you to understand at gut level: this group makes music strictly for the moment, creating a shared language in real time. As its members explained this spring, before the release of their entrancing self-titled debut, this highwire creative model is rooted in acute listening and mutual trust. Whatever the gesture — when Iyer plays a somber, strobing figure on Fender Rhodes piano, for example, or Ismaily wobbles a line on electric bass — it can be seen as an invitation. This performance, a marvel of concision by Love in Exile standards, extends a similar courtesy to any receptive ear.

msdmQDNxsfw,Sid Sriram: Tiny Desk Concert,"NPR Music's Tiny Desk is celebrating Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. These artists represent just a sliver of the cultural diversity that exists within the Asian American and Pacific Islander community.

Suraya Mohamed | May 10, 2023
For Sid Sriram and his band, playing loud is the norm. But in anticipation for this Tiny Desk, he turned the volume down while rehearsing for this unique acoustic setting. ""When it gets quiet, you hear the subtleties, the background, vocal sounds and it even inspires new vocal ideas because you're not hearing everything, powered up all the way,"" Sriram told NPR before the concert. ""The drummers tried different things out, and with two, that can get really chaotic sometimes. But the way they kind of mesh with each other, everything is dialed in.""

Sriram was born in Chennai, India but grew up in Fremont, Calif. When he was 3 years old, his family taught him a South Indian classical, largely devotional discipline called Carnatic music. Later, he discovered jazz, R&B and soul music. Those forms of music helped him discover, explore and celebrate the whole spectrum of his identity.

While you can hear those musical influences in these songs, what is really striking is the ease with which he molds them all together. Add to the mix his powerful yet warm vocal quality and the ensemble's effective layering of sounds. ""That's why music in general encapsulates this idea that pushes are momentum,"" Sriram said. ""I wanted to figure out how we could bring the spectrum of dynamic and nice [music], and the best way to do it."" Look for his new album, Sidharth, coming this summer.

r_PNkXFdTog,caroline: Tiny Desk Concert,"Lars Gotrich | May 3, 2023
London's caroline typically performs in a circle, a visual metaphor attuned to the connections made as members face each other. But in its Tiny Desk performance, the group adjusted its stage plot slightly for a new setting, still singing together of yearning, of fatigue, of kinship. Gusts of post-rock, emo, folk and minimalism sweep around the octet's sound, but the musical mish-mash isn't quite the point — caroline stresses a communal spirit, witnessed here in a beautiful set.

Over three songs performed from caroline's self-titled debut — one of NPR Music's 50 best albums of 2022 —  strings skitter and swoon, guitars stutter and drum sticks roll atop the Tiny Desk itself. In sprawling arrangements and frenzied improvisations, this is impatient music that awaits patient ears. There's power and vulnerability in choral singing, where different kinds of voices aid and uplift the moment for something better. That's especially the case on ""Dark blue,"" with a mournful-yet-triumphant chord progression you could sit inside forever, as the music shifts and shuffles over a bustling drone and the band offers a deceptively simple carpe diem: ""I want it all.""

8IcrlAYyA_o,Kenny Garrett and Sounds From The Ancestors: Tiny Desk Concert,"Suraya Mohamed | May 2, 2023
Saxophonist Kenny Garrett has been a significant player in jazz for more than 30 years. He's played with the best: Miles Davis, Art Blakey and The Jazz Messengers, Donald Byrd, Freddie Hubbard, Woody Shaw, the Duke Ellington Orchestra and more. And with such a fabled past, he is still pushing the boundaries of modern jazz. His most recent album, Sounds from the Ancestors, was one of NPR Music's best albums of 2021.

""I believe that music does heal people,"" Garrett said in a recent interview. ""That's the reason that I play this music, because I know it heals me."" You can hear that spiritual belief along with gospel elements of the Black American church on the first song of this Tiny Desk performance, ""When the Days Were Different."" On ""Hargrove"" Garrett pays homage to both John Coltrane's A Love Supreme and trumpeter Roy Hargrove, as the song's hard-bop infused R&B groove builds momentum right up until the end.

The set finishes strong with Ronald Bruner Jr. on drums driving an expressive display of polyrhythmic virtuosity on Garrett's ""For Art's Sake,"" a stunning tribute to drummers Art Blakey and Tony Allen that embraces both modern jazz and Afrobeat influences.

Garrett was in town to receive the National Endowment for the Arts' highest honor in jazz: the 2023 NEA Jazz Masters award. This Tiny Desk plus other events marked the festive occasion that culminated with an exciting tribute concert at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.

With a Dr. Simi doll in front of him, pop cariño Cuco brought every single piece of who he is and his artistry to El Tiny.

Slow-rolling through a set of four tracks, he seamlessly blended the soul of chicano ballads and the smooth energy of soft rock anthems. Opening with gentle vocals and simple chords on “Pendant,” Cuco brought corazon from an earlier era to his concert. Closing out the emo moment with a sweet guitar solo, he moved on to the tranquil percussion of “Hydrocodone,” delivering heartbroken melody and transporting the audience back to the bedroom where his songwriting career first began. 

Complementing the rumbling bass with some light synth, he showcases that same soulful energy on “Feelings,” and closes out the set with the bumpy, bilingual new track “Under the Sun,” shifting to cumbia rhythms as he swaps languages. The guitar-heavy, percussive-laden show invites the audience to share in a Cuco we’ve never seen before, all parts heartbroken, hopeful, and evolving.

Tu_PRf1tyjI,Bill Orcutt Guitar Quartet: Tiny Desk Concert,"Lars Gotrich | April 26, 2023
""How loud can we be?"" Bill Orcutt asked as his guitar quartet tuned their Telecasters and Jazzmasters for sound check. A wild deconstructionist whose catalog spans a splatter of hardcore punk, noise and electronic music, Orcutt has written and improvised on four-stringed guitars for four decades, culminating in the ecstatic minimalism of last year's Music for Four Guitars, each part played and dubbed over by himself.

At the Tiny Desk, however, Orcutt brought along a who's who of forward-thinking guitarists to perform these rowdy, giddy and shreddy pieces: Wendy Eisenberg, Ava Mendoza and Shane Parish, who transcribed the original recordings. From a frenzied hoedown (""Or from behind"") and feedback-humming drone-pop (""In the rain"") to something resembling Henry Cow playing Norwegian black metal (""In profile"") and paradoxically Brutalist complexity (""Or head on""), each song is a short burst of finger-flicked frenzy.

vN7a3xGB0C0,Lara Downes: Tiny Desk Concert,"Tom Huizenga | April 21, 2023
Most Tiny Desk artists roll into our office space with a suitcase or two because they're on tour. But when pianist Lara Downes arrived for this springtime performance, she unpacked an entire suitcase stuffed with imitation flowers, ivy and butterflies. Our job? Decorate the piano.

Downes knows how to mix and match music. She's an indefatigable concert pianist and recording artist who also hosts her own radio show on KUSC, and her own interview video series, Amplify. Her theme here is renewal, the possibilities that come with change and the power of community.

An arrangement of Schubert's song ""Belief in Spring"" opens, with a yearning melody in the right hand and a comforting, swaying bassline in the left. Contemporary music follows in Clarice Assad's ""World of Change,"" which percolates with rhythmic and harmonic fluctuations. Then another gear shift back in time to J.S. Bach and the beloved ""Sleepers Awake,"" his own alteration of an old hymn that served as a beacon of light in troubled times.

Downes has her ears wide open for new composers. She found Hooshyar Khayam online; they met in Montreal, and now the Iranian composer is writing a concerto for her. ""Jazz On Her Lips,"" Downes says, is his paean to ""the women of Iran in their quest for freedom."" That quest also resounds in what Downes calls a song about second chances, an arrangement of the traditional hymn ""Amazing Grace"" by Shawn Okpebholo, a young Black composer on the rise. It is by turns elegant and soulful.

This is Downes at her best, reminding us of our shared struggles and dreams, through carefully curated pieces and refined performances.

SET LIST
Schubert (arr. Horn): ""Frühlingsglaube""
Clarice Assad: ""World of Change""
J.S. Bach (arr. Friedman): ""Sleepers Awake""

FCjsmZlwSzA,Claudia Acuña: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | April 17, 2023
Claudia Acuña's art comes from a deep and spiritual place. From her native Chile, she has channeled her passion for jazz vocals into a career that most recently included a superb album of duets with other jazz A-listers. 

She starts her turn behind the Desk with an almost ceremonial incantation of purpose with her song ""Yo,"" which translates to ""I Am."" Serenaded by the heartbeat-like rhythm of a South American bombo léguero and the delicate strings of a cuatro, it’s a fitting introduction to her three song set. Her bilingual performance slips into English with ""That's What They Say,"" which displays her skills at interpretation, the foundation of the best jazz singing. The band's subtle shift to an uptempo samba at the end also features a genre-bending piano sólo by Pablo Bergara. 

One thing the best jazz vocalists do is create a space in which their voice takes on a deep musical quality, like a horn or other melodic instruments.  That’s on full display in Acuña’s next tune, ""Hey,"" a song dedicated to the power of women. Surrounded by bandmates like bassist Carlos Henderson and drummer Yayo Serka, Claudia Acuña has assembled the perfect cast of conspirators to help her leave a lasting impression of her art on the jazz world.

DL1zyUjzwno,RAYE: Tiny Desk Concert,"Ashley Pointer | April 12, 2023
""I'm a songwriter for a living, okay. I usually have all the words but I'm genuinely speechless."" RAYE told the audience at her Tiny Desk. ""All I've wanted is to be seen and respected as a musician.""

The South London-bred singer-songwriter had finally made her way to NPR headquarters, her signature cherry-hued pin curls full of bounce and a radiant smile spread across her face. It was a long time coming, and in a re-arranged set of songs from her stunning debut album tailored to the Tiny Desk, RAYE exuded the confidence and abilities of a veteran vocal powerhouse.

In the game for over a decade, RAYE's debut album was 7 years in the making after being stuck in a major label deal that had her confined to recording mainstream pop and electronic records, and penning hits for other artists instead of executing her own creative vision. Now independent, she released the genre-busting My 21st Century Blues this year, an impressive and raw album that touches on some of the artist's most vulnerable life experiences. Over the course of her Tiny Desk, RAYE's musicianship shines as she displays a melange of jazz scats, gospel and blues inflections. Closing out her set with ""Buss It Down.,"" she recruits the audience for some call and response action only after giving us a brief vocal lesson, 'cause that's just how particular she is. If this Tiny Desk concert is your introduction to RAYE, prepare to be enraptured.

4iQmPv_dTI0,Fred again..: Tiny Desk Concert,"Teresa Xie | April 10, 2023
When Fred again.. first proposed a Tiny Desk concert, it wasn't immediately clear how he was going to make it work — not because he lacked creativity, but because translating purely electronic music at the Desk is a daunting task for anyone. How would an artist, whose performances take the form of DJ sets in front of massive audiences, curate an intimate and unique experience? But what the British songwriter and producer came up with is a reminder of what a Tiny Desk is at its best: an opportunity for artists to challenge themselves in such a way that it almost feels like they're making new music, all while sticking to what feels true to them. For Fred again.. that meant re-learning the marimba, playing the vibraphone, singing at the piano and looping sounds and beats — all at the same time. He began his set with ""Kyle (i found you),"" recreating the song's melody on the marimba while clips of featured poet Kyle ""Guante"" Tran Myhre reciting the work ""Love In The Time of Undeath"" appeared on-screen. Sitting at the piano, he faded the remnants of ""Kyle (i found you)"" into ""Roze (forgive),"" which features Fred again.. triggering vocals sampled from the artist I am Roze, whose powerful facial expressions were magnified on a screen.In a surprising pivot, the primary vocals on the following track, ""Me (heavy),"" came from Fred again.. himself, with no manipulation, creating a vulnerable sense of intimacy in the space. A flurry of looped piano keys marked the transition to ""Delilah (pull me out of this),"" with guest vocals pulled from pop singer Delilah Montagu's 2021 track ""Lost Keys."" By his set's end, concluding with ""Faisal (envelops me),"" Fred again.. was back at the piano finally resting after moving seamlessly through a jam-packed Tiny Desk.

SET LIST
""Kyle (i found you)""
""Roze (forgive)""
""Adam (interlude)""

BvsPwwphxrg,Trina: Tiny Desk Concert,"Sidney Madden | April 7, 2023
""I wanna introduce you guys to the baddest bitch,"" Trina told the audience of her Tiny Desk. ""The original baddest bitch."" It's a title no one but the hip-hop icon herself could been able to claim at the Tiny Desk — and for good reason.

As a rapper, Trina has been pushing P since before her successors were even sitting up in Pampers and her wild ride of a Tiny Desk concert, 25 years after making her rap debut, only further proves why she is the blueprint.

Decked out in leather, diamonds and a wavy jet-black bussdown, the vet got comfortable behind the Desk quickly, ready to give fans the best of her sprawling discography. Trina temporarily fought back tears as she recited ""Mama,"" a dedication to her late mother who died of cancer in 2019. The crew made the breakup anthem ""Here We Go"" feel even more aching. The energy in the space made a seismic shift when the band took on the bass-bumpin' classic ""Da Baddest Bitch,"" infusing the live arrangement with nimble guitar, charismatic drums and background vocalists so entertaining, their delivery felt like epic narration from the chorus of an ancient Greek play or, just as epically, a group homegirls hyping up their friend at the function. In the middle of it all was the 305 Queen herself, killing her verses with breath control, authority and bougie hair flips.

""I believe in who I am. The game didn't make me; I made the game. I made it,"" the Diamond Princess declared in her Louder Than A Riot interview before recording this Tiny Desk concert. ""I already came in with a motive and an initiative to know who I am from. That's why I breed a whole universe of bad bitches."" To hear Trina's full interview, subscribe to NPR Music's Louder Than A Riot podcast.

0kKct_AKz8s,Kassa Overall: Tiny Desk Concert,"Suraya Mohamed | April 5, 2023
Kassa Overall is no stranger to NPR. Back in 2020 he was a featured vocalist and percussionist on the Terri Lyne Carrington + Social Science Tiny Desk concert and in the same year he scored the original music for the first season of NPR Music's Louder Than A Riot podcast. (His catchy theme song has been remixed by producer Suzi Analogue for the show's second season.) Now, Kassa's back again, leading his own band and doing what he always does — pushing musical boundaries and finding new ways to express himself through a unique blend of experimental hip-hop-infused jazz.

This Tiny Desk starts with two cuts from ANIMALS, Kassa's May release that will be featured on his upcoming summer tour. On ""Ready To Ball,"" pianist Ian Finkelstein opens with a chord progression that signals bebop but quickly moves into a more dynamic, experimental sound with hypnotic meter changes and surprising interludes.

""Make My Way Back Home"" is a beautiful song featuring Nick Hakim's sultry vocals overtop a captivating rhythmic foundation with an avant-garde yet familiar feel. I especially love the catchy melodic line, one you can sing along to even if only hearing this tune for the first time.

Then, Kassa's outstanding drum solo on ""Find Me"" moves into a driving percussive groove that breaks for a short rap interlude and thoughtful melodic moments featuring soprano saxophonist Tomoki Sanders and vocalist J. Hoard. ""Who's on the Playlist"" is an oldie but goodie from Kassa's 2019 record, Go Get Ice Cream and Listen to Jazz, which finishes the set with a continued virtuosic display of musicianship, lyricism and artistic innovation.

klL7nY1HzaY,Durand Bernarr: Tiny Desk Concert,"Mitra I. Arthur | March 31, 2023
Durand Bernarr is an experience. At the Tiny Desk, members of his band — clad in costumes evoking characters from the Disney Channel animated series The Proud Family — surrounded Bernarr, outfitted in a white and magenta sequined ensemble with a wig styled in a pompadour, channeling the electric energy of the soul and funk singer of the Proud Family, Uncle Bobby.

More than an experience, Bernarr is a skilled singer. He's gained a following from his catchy albums (including his most recent, Wanderlust), his time spent backing Erykah Badu on tour and his appearances on BET programming. His voice jumps from robust baritone to clear falsetto with ease. Every song takes on a different musical character as he curates the show needed for each audience.

When reflecting on his visit to the Tiny Desk, Bernarr remarked, ""I had to show on this platform I'm so much more than just R&B."" And he did just that, using, as he put it, ""a smooth, alternative James Brown, vaudeville jingles, Quiet Storm, Chanté Moore, jazz, R&B, Patrice Rushen, hip-hop, bluegrass, country, musical theater, house, funk, opera, rock..."" to showcase his showmanship at its peak.

Bernarr told the Tiny Desk team: ""I'm not meant to be understood; I'm meant to be experienced."" I imagine not many Tiny Desks experiences wrap up like his did: with a shirtless performer going into a dip and Diana Ross-in-Mahogany-style twirls, and then weaving his way through the audience supplying hugs and high fives.

vt0J3IEYkIg,The Beths: Tiny Desk Concert,"Lars Gotrich | March 28, 2023
If you squint hard enough at the paper in front of Elizabeth Stokes, you'll find an encouraging note she wrote to herself: Breathe. Relax. Smile. (followed by a hand-drawn smiley face, of course). We get it: The Tiny Desk is filmed in broad daylight, at eye level, in front of NPR employees and, eventually, is released to ""the inside of your computer."" A small reminder helps.

The thing about The Beths, however, is that you can hear the support and camaraderie of its four members throughout the band's fuzzy-yet-sparkling indie pop — not just in how they dryly joke with each other but in how their arrangements uplift one another. Take, for instance, ""Expert in a Dying Field"" (from, as Stokes tells us, the album Expert in a Dying Field) when the full-band harmony kicks in to repeat and emphasize Stokes' existential question about the changing of times. Or on ""Jump Rope Gazers"" (from, as Stokes again tells us, the album Jump Rope Gazers) as she sheepishly but charmingly declares, ""I think I love you"" to a special someone, and Benjamin Sinclair's clarinet curlicues act as the mirrored response.

The New Zealanders also offer quieter versions of ""Out of Sight"" and ""When You Know You Know."" The former, in particular, is transformed from a loud, shoegazing dream to Burt Bacharach-ian soft rock, immediately becoming my new favorite Beths song; it happens to close with a perfect summation of the band's empathetic way of being: ""I keep a flame burning inside / If you need to bum a light.""

sovwUwi5SFA,Ingrid Andress: Tiny Desk Concert,"Stephen Thompson | March 22, 2023
Ingrid Andress performs and speaks with a humility that feels inversely proportional to the scale of her success. Given that she's already received four Grammy nominations, and that her team had to navigate NPR's busy and construction-forward D.C. neighborhood in a tour bus only slightly smaller than an aircraft carrier, that adds up to a fair bit of humility.

For Andress, writing songs often means having to explain yourself. Between songs at the Tiny Desk, she wrangled with her place in country music — as a Colorado-bred singer-songwriter who sings and speaks without a twang — and with the truths she's capturing and conjuring in her songs. ""Yearbook,"" about a curdled high-school romance, appears to be about her parents, but that required an explanation, too: ""I always have to say, it's not about my parents. Because they really want everyone to know that. So, it sounds like it's about them. But when I write songs, sometimes I take from things that I have observed — like, other people's stories.""

All three of the songs she played at the Tiny Desk — ""Yearbook,"" her 2020 breakthrough ballad ""More Hearts Than Mine"" and her current country hit ""Feel Like This"" — have ways of digging up clear-headed truths, no matter how she came about locating them. ""Feel Like This"" captures what Andress describes as an uncharacteristic sense of optimism, while returning to one of her favorite themes: the radical change that comes with shedding the toxicity of bad relationships.

tZWZ82Em-Q8,Tye Tribbett: Tiny Desk Concert,"Suraya Mohamed | March 20, 2023

It was a bit of a tight fit, getting the choir, horns and full rhythm section properly situated behind the center nook of the Desk where Tye Tribbett would eventually stand. As the band warmed up, there was concern that his voice might not carry over the fullness of the talented ensemble. During the rehearsal, he stood nearby, directing music cues, occasionally taking a moment to make “grrrr” vocalizations as the band adjusted to bring the loudness down. They quickly found just the right level and when Tribbett moved into place for sound check, his lead vocal both blended into and soared above the magnificence of the band’s high energy praise music.

Even before the production crew pushed their record buttons, an excitement filled the air. As the first song developed, the intensity rose to an even higher level, setting the tone for an emotional, spiritual experience. Musical excellence was abundant as the singers lifted their voices with precise intonation, and Tribbetts’ vigor was infectious. The complex instrumental arrangements included jazzy licks and funky beats that drove spontaneous but smooth transitions in and out of six inspiring songs.

Before the last tune, the encouraging “Be Alright,” Tribbett exclaimed, “There is hope! You’re never hopeless. I know your world gets dark and you feel all by yourself. You think nobody sees you but God sees you and not only does he see you but he’s been with you the whole time.”

oxo-loXdcH0,Bono and The Edge: Tiny Desk Concert,"Robin Hilton | March 17, 2023
It's hard to overstate the kindness and good-natured humor Bono and The Edge brought to the Tiny Desk. When they first arrived at the NPR Music offices, Bono spoke on an imaginary phone, ""The talent's here! The talent's coming through,"" poking fun at their own fame, while carrying The Edge's guitar. (The Edge called Bono the best roadie he's ever had.) The two never stopped beaming, like two overjoyed newcomers thrilled at the chance to play for someone.

The performance was a preview of U2's new album, Songs Of Surrender, featuring stripped-down versions of songs from across the band's catalog. To help pull off several reimagined songs from the 2000 album All That You Can't Leave Behind, Bono and The Edge invited a teen choir from the Duke Ellington School of the Arts in Washington, D.C., to join them. During rehearsals, Bono told the students to think of ""Beautiful Day"" as the kind of ""post-drinking"" singalong you'd bellow with friends after leaving a bar. He then quickly realized none of them are old enough to drink, before feigning a heart attack.

Traveling without bassist Adam Clayton or drummer Larry Mullen Jr., Bono and The Edge made the trip from Ireland to the States specifically for the Tiny Desk, arriving in D.C. after five days of rehearsals at Bono's New York apartment. When they settled in for the performance, they treated the office to four songs, including a deeply emotional version of ""Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of,"" written for the late INXS singer Michael Hutchence, and a reworked version of ""Walk On,"" which Bono said was inspired by and dedicated to the people of Ukraine.

JsaqhRkKu1M,Andrew Combs: Tiny Desk Concert,"Tom Huizenga | March 15, 2023
The concept of our Tiny Desk is to capture artists up close and personal, a design that couldn't be a better fit for Andrew Combs' recent music. He and his band loaded in the standard drums, bass, guitar and keys — even a saxophone or two — behind the Desk, but Combs deploys the instruments sparingly in transparent arrangements that delicately undergird his soft, high tenor and falsetto vocal stylings.

He is a risk-taker in his singing, songwriting and even in his visual art. The Nashville-based artist boldly moved away from his Americana pigeon-hole on his album Ideal Man, brilliantly flirting with rock and pop. His latest, Sundays, which this Tiny Desk set relies heavily on, was another left turn. Inspired by his personal struggles amid the height of the pandemic, Combs recorded the album in mono, giving these contemplative songs the intimacy of living room performances.

Combs builds this set artfully. He starts with the incantatory ""Shall We Go?"" inspired by Samuel Beckett's play Waiting for Godot, sliding right into ""Anna Please,"" based on Ingmar Bergman's devastating film Cries and Whispers — two theatrical works exploring the absurd nature of life and the quotidian horror of death. That a song like ""(God)less"" follows, should be no surprise. ""It's about finding beauty in the chaos,"" Combs says.

And then, as if to remind us that not all is lost, he ends with a love song so sweet and pure it could take your breath away. Combs is an artist who keeps challenging himself and us. And isn't that what great art is supposed to do?

JZyaHcYEsWM,Selina Moon: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | March 9, 2023
When Selina Moon said she's dreamed of playing the Tiny Desk, there's plenty of proof behind the statement. The Los Angeles-based singer-songwriter and jewelry maker had entered the Tiny Desk Contest five years in a row, and even intended to submit a sixth submission this year. She told us that the Contest had been a significant conduit for growth that inspired her to form a band and add the harp to her musical repertoire. When Bob Boilen and I discussed her entry video on the first episode of the Tiny Desk Top Shelf series in 2020, we agreed that her presentation felt familiar and would work easily in our space. Year after year, her submissions got consistently better, and even though she didn't win, her name was in the top rankings by nearly all judges involved. So this year, we invited her to the real Tiny Desk. Following the show, I asked Selina how it felt to play behind the Desk, and she said, ""I've imagined and rehearsed being here for so long; it just felt natural.""

Her confidence and sense of belonging struck me the most throughout her set; then, her subtle yet soulful vocal acrobatics. Selina opened the set with ""Hummingbird,"" the song she submitted for 2021's Contest, featuring brothers Ryan Studer and Andy Motoi on strings and Josh Linsky on djembe, all of whom played in the original entry video. The band then bounced around more of Selina's brilliant catalog of former submissions. She shared that she has hundreds of unreleased songs she's eager to put out. There's probably no better time than now to share.

yeFcUbGW1gA,Mama's Broke: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | March 8, 2023
A couple of chairs, a small room and a cozy crowd describes the last eight years of tour stops for Mama’s Broke. Having performed in intimate venues including homes and cabins, as well as stages, being at the Tiny Desk may have felt right at home for the Canadian duo. Lisa Maria Bates and Amy Lou Keeler make powerful songs with haunting harmonies and a mesh of fiddle, banjo, mandolin and guitar. You’ll hear unique rhythms as Amy takes her chopsticks to Lisa’s fiddle and Lisa takes her heels to the floorboard.

Elements of Appalachian folk, Celtic ballads, Nova Scotian traditions and Ukrainian folk from Lisa’s grandfather’s collection are woven into the duo’s music. The frantic pace of touring came to a halt for Amy and Lisa when the COVID pandemic started, like it did for much of the world, and they had some time to write tunes and try out new tunings. The opening song, written in Lisa’s uninsulated Nova Scotia cabin in the throes of the first pandemic winter, is filled with poignant resignation.

Just pick one, it’ll hurt some if it needs to 
I know weakness is a sickness and a virtue
And cold bitter winds are never-ending
So just pick one, it’s a season, it’ll run through

The songs come from Mama’s Broke’s new album, Narrow Line, and its2017 debut, Count The Wicked. There are moments of hope in this set of somewhat dark songs: “What Can May Come” is one of those moments, and also, in the final tune “The Ones That I Love,” where Amy and Lisa put down their instruments and send love through those perfect harmonies.

JxEvAHLqryg,Jorge Glem and Sam Reider: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | March 6, 2023
It’s a very special thing when two musical cultures come together to create something that didn’t exist before. That’s exactly what we got to witness in this performance from Venezuelan cuatro master Jorge Glem and extraordinary accordionist Sam Reider, as they set up behind the Desk for a set of highly creative, original music from their project Brooklyn Cumaná.

Glem’s dexterity on the small, traditional guitar-like instrument is evident from the very first notes of “Skeleton Rag,” as he plucks out a percussive, staccato pattern that is more Brazilian than the sweeping strums of Venezuelan folk music, as Reider leans into a melody that could easily be folkloric if it wasn’t something he dreamed up. Even as they end the tune at a breakneck speed, it’s only the beginning of the fireworks. “Sábana Blanca y Fuga con Estribillo” which follows, is based on a traditional Venezuelan folk tune and eventually erupts into a rustic exhibition of Glem’s vocals.

After a brief explanation in Spanish about the traditional song forms they work from, the duo eases into “Malagueña Cumanesa,” a lament based on a memory from Glem’s childhood.
“Coroticos” is a fiery exercise in an odd time meter that is actually part of Venezuelan tradition and it’s a showcase for how these two virtuoso musicians test the limits of their instruments while they expand our expectations of the accordion and cuatro. The magic of this music is watching both artists completely enjoy each other’s playing, with knowing glances and spontaneous vocal encouragement.

Qafq8drD_L4,Antonio Sánchez & Bad Hombre: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | March 2, 2023
Watching Antonio Sánchez and Bad Hombre behind the Tiny Desk is witnessing an entire band exploring the rhythm of language.

Fueled by Sánchez's propulsive drumming, the band both complements and acts as a foil to vocalist Thana Alexa's soaring interpretations of three tracks from Sánchez's latest album, SHIFT (Bad Hombre, Vol II).

Bassist Lex Sadler and keyboard wizard BIGYUKI join Sánchez and Alexa to kick things off with ""Doyenne,"" a song that features a powerful drum solo that reflects why Sánchez is a first-call sideman to a number of A-List jazz musicians (not to mention his 18 years with guitarist Pat Metheny).

On ""The Bucket,"" the band falls into a drone-like groove while Alexa's vocals swoop and soar through the music. Her spoken word delivery at the end is powerful for its content as well as the band's supple support.

Chilean-French singer Ana Tijoux co-wrote the last tune, ""Mi palabra,"" and true to her hip-hop roots, the song is a meditation on how language and voice can be the ultimate source of rhythm. BIGYUKI moves the band from a whisper to a scream, pulling out a variety of notes and sounds during a solo that mirrors the rhythmic sensibilities that Tijoux has set up with her stream of free-flowing word play.

Antonio Sánchez observes the world with a drummer's sensibilities. As he tours with his pals in Bad Hombre and puts on performances like these, he expresses the kind of musicality that makes him one of today's best jazz drummers.

DHjczZIxr_0,Omah Lay: Tiny Desk Concert,"This year's Black History Month celebration at the Tiny Desk features a carefully crafted lineup spanning many genres, generations and walks of life. Each artist represents the best in their class and will be performing at the Tiny Desk for the first time.

Bobby Carter | February 28, 2023
Omah Lay brought a calm demeanor and a bright smile to his time at NPR headquarters. By the third song of his Tiny Desk concert, “soso,” I realized that the Nigerian star was exercising lots of emotions through this set. The first two titles, “Bad Influence” and “i’m a mess,” are self-explanatory, yet the message of “soso” — that he’s yearning for something to take his pain away — could get lost in the song’s upbeat rhythms. At any rate, Omah Lay’s performance showcases a songwriter grappling with all the feels, unafraid to share them with the world.  

Omah Lay rose to prominence during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic with his debut EP, Get Layd. In a short time, he’s joined the slew of African artists who’ve dominated dance floors and infiltrated America with Afro-fusion music. The feat is extraordinary and bittersweet, given that when he first broke through, the music industry was in a frenzy and the clubs closed. But songs like “Lo Lo” and “Free My Mind” resonated despite not booming in the big speakers, and he kept working until it was safe to come back out — and landed even more hits. He made the trip from Nigeria exclusively for the Tiny Desk and brought his band, The Raw Soundz, from Ghana, plus percussionist Boogie and singers Monet Shelton and Domo Abrams. Together, they flipped selections from Omah’s catalog, including a new version of his hit “understand” with a twist.

rPVQlQQgPLg,Charley Crockett: Tiny Desk Concert,"Jewly Hight | February 24, 2023

Charley Crockett knew what he was doing when he stood behind the Tiny Desk and introduced himself by smoothly dropping three names: Charley Pride, Davy Crockett and Freddy Fender. With those references, the Texas troubadour framed his concert as a shrewd conversation with sturdy, old ways of singing, spinning yarns of folk heroism and drawing freely from the cultural melting pot of American song.

In his vintage Stetson, Crockett came off as a seasoned and courtly showman. Here and there he invoked his own colorful lore, from his legal troubles to his street-corner busking days. But what really charmed the intimate office crowd on hand was how much new meaning he teased out of familiar country, folk and blues forms over the course of five songs with accomplished ease.

In his version of a murder ballad, ""The Man from Waco,"" he dwelled not on the ruthless act committed, but the psychological turmoil radiating from it. His country-blues number ""Are We Lonesome Yet"" captured the dissonance between inner alienation and contemporary clamor in a wonderfully knowing way. And his performance of ""Welcome to Hard Times,"" rhythmically loose and swinging thanks to his Kullen Fox's honky-tonk piano flourishes, revealed glimpses of carefully guarded sensitivity alongside the song's wry fatalism. ""Hope you're feelin' welcome,"" Crockett chuckled dryly, ""to hard times."" The way that he ended certain lines with subtle, upward scoops in melody said a lot: He didn't need big, flashy gestures to make deep feelings land.

KgDPEW_ypj8,Ab-Soul: Tiny Desk Concert,"This year's Black History Month celebration at the Tiny Desk features a carefully crafted lineup spanning many genres, generations and walks of life. Each artist represents the best in their class and will be performing at the Tiny Desk for the first time.

Bobby Carter | February 23, 2023
Hip-hop artists arguably make the most significant adjustments to play behind the Tiny Desk. The essence is two turntables and a microphone which, in time, evolved into bands for some. Ab-Soul, rarely seen with a live band, hand-picked a group of musicians he deemed the ""Soulersystem"" for his turn at the Desk. This display of raw honesty and next-level lyricism comes from his latest album, HERBERT. Before launching into some brand-new bars, he reminded us we'd approached a landmark in hip-hop culture this year: ""We just here to restore the feeling. What you say? Fifty years of hip hop?""

Herbert Stevens IV is a prime example of how rap music has grown. There's always a song to feel good and party to. Soul can do that, but he's best known for his music's depth, vulnerability and wordplay. The Carson, Calif. native has spared few details about what he's endured and how much he's lost. The opening frame of his performance shows the back of his customized jacket, featuring an image of one of his best friends, DoeBurger, who passed in 2021. The framed pictures surrounding the desk are from his childhood, some graphically detailing his bout with Stevens-Johnson syndrome. This rare disorder ravaged his skin and eventually left him legally blind.

Between the HERBERT songs, Soul delivered more never-heard-before rhymes over instrumentals from 2012's Control System. He perfectly conveys the emotional shift between the two ""BE LIKE THAT"" verses, and throughout the entire set, the band adds even more subtle nuances. He closes with ""GOTTA RAP,"" but not before another exclusive verse that will surely get people talking. Ab-Soul wanted to release his Tiny Desk on his birthday, which feels suitable as he considers this his ""second second chance.""

Bobby Carter | February 20, 2023
The powerful messages of her music, magnified by the strength of Tamela Mann's vocals, made for a tearful Tiny Desk concert. These were happy tears; eventually, Tamela herself, overcome with emotion, explained how singing her songs helps keep her faith intact. After closing with one of her signature songs, ""Take Me to the King,"" she gave us some parting words of encouragement. ""Let's just hold on to faith, hold on to hope, hold on to joy,"" she said, ""because it still exists in our society.""

The Fort Worth, Texas, native's calling was evident early in her childhood, wowing the congregation at Holy Tabernacle church by the time she was 12. Her career has since stretched far beyond music. After meeting Tyler Perry in 1999, she and her husband, actor David Mann, became integral to his explosion on the stage, television and film. Faith and family have remained at the helm throughout her decorated career, earning Stellar Awards and a Grammy. Her daughter, Porcia, coordinated their trip to Washington, D.C., while her daughter Tia sang background, and of course, David was in the audience entertaining the crowd before and after the show. It's impossible to tell the history of Black people in America without the gospel, and Tamela Mann represented at NPR headquarters.

kbvIoW5-b8E,Theo Croker: Tiny Desk Concert,"This year's Black History Month celebration at the Tiny Desk features a carefully crafted lineup spanning many genres, generations and walks of life. Each artist represents the best in their class and will be performing at the Tiny Desk for the first time.

Mitra I. Arthur | February 17, 2023
Trumpeter Theo Croker arrived at the Tiny Desk with an unmistakable air of chill, an easy smile on display. That chill is the result of a clear musical approach and determination that dates back to Croker's teenage days forming big bands and fearlessly pushing the bounds of the music played by his grandfather, trumpeter Doc Cheatham. His reach includes collaborations with a variety of musicians: vocalists Ari Lennox and Jill Scott, rappers J. Cole and Wyclef Jean and mentors including NEA Jazz Master Dee Dee Bridgewater and saxophonist Gary Bartz. Croker's latest two albums, LOVE QUANTUM and BLK2LIFE // A FUTURE PAST, and new EP BY THE WAY showcase Croker's journey as a trumpeter, composer and producer in expanding the music commonly known as jazz with hip-hop, R&B and electronic sounds.

Croker's performance here is a stripped-down version of a Theo Croker show you might see these days. His first composition, ""JAZZ IS DEAD,"" is anchored by a bassline provided by Eric Wheeler that stayed in my mind for days. The declarative title is sure to catch attention and elicit questions, but listen to the lyrics to understand Croker's determination to both reclaim, and expand, the form. ""The Messenger"" features a dazzling solo from pianist Michael King, leading into Croker's trumpet dancing over the melody. The joy in ""Happy Feet (for dancers),"" featuring the rich vocals of MALAYA, might have you adding the song to your next party playlist. The last song in the set, ""No Escape from Bliss,"" is an aptly named calming and contemplative resolution to the performance.

Q7D61-XF3x4,Fousheé: Tiny Desk Concert,"This year's Black History Month celebration at the Tiny Desk features a carefully crafted lineup spanning many genres, generations and walks of life. Each artist represents the best in their class and will be performing at the Tiny Desk for the first time.

Ashley Pointer | February 15, 2023
Britanny Fousheé is not an artist who can be boxed in. When she first arrived at NPR headquarters, she had a very chill and collected aura surrounding her — despite the fact that the Grammys were being held the following weekend and a song she co-wrote, Steve Lacy's ""Bad Habit,"" had received several nominations. Over the course of her four-song set at the Tiny Desk, the New Jersey-bred artist flexes her eclectic artistry and vocal range, taking us through a myriad of emotions.

In this performance, she's backed by Tobias Kelly on drums, Jake Strade on bass and Lilly Graves on guitar and takes us on a journey through her brief but very bold catalog. Opening with ""spend the money"" from softCORE, her debut grunge album that was rearranged to fit our intimate space, Fousheé lets acoustic guitars take the lead as her tender voice shimmers just above the surface while dynamic drums and bass lay a solid foundation. When the band transitions into ""i'm fine,"" we hear more of Fousheé's half-whispered vocals right before she unleashes a full-fledged scream, forcefully affirming the song's title just right before sending us the sweetest smile. ""Maybe I'm not fine, but are any of us?"" Fousheé says to the crowd. ""And it's OK to not be fine. It's all about balance.""

She finds that balance as she closes out her performance with a couple of recognizable oldies but goodies: ""single af,"" a ballad where her graceful falsetto floats over a soulful laid-back groove, and the big finale, ""candy grapes,"" an elaborate song in which she showcases her impressive vocal range as she dares anyone to try her.

BPRVzA67Dbs,Kenny Beats: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | February 13, 2023
“I know producers don’t always get to do stuff like this,” Kenny Beats said as he wrapped up his Tiny Desk concert. “I’m very lucky I get to do a lot of stuff people with my job title don’t get to do.” His keen sense of gratitude was palpable and radiated throughout the space. Before the music started, he rushed over to explore the shelves behind the Desk, then added some of his trinkets. He then insisted the music had to be perfect as his dad would be listening. Kenny’s debut solo album, LOUIE, dedicated to his father, takes us on a journey through often inexplicable emotions regarding our parents. Kenny enlisted familiar voices to convey the feelings, sparingly incorporating their vocals over soulful beats. 

He invited some of those vocalists, along with top-tier musicians including Nick Movshon and Leon Michels, to play something tailor-made for the Tiny Desk. For “Still,” rapper JPEGMAFIA finishes his thought through bars that we don’t hear on the album. His rambunctious energy juxtaposed with the band’s laid-back melodies is a bizarre sight, but it just works. When Remi Wolf sings, her powerful voice naturally cuts above everything else, and she stole the show on “Last Words.” Newcomer Nami’s falsetto brightened all of the harmonies, and he stepped up to close out with “Rotten.” 

Kenny Beats is one of the most sought after producers in music and is most certainly the go-to for marrying different genres. Producer-hosted albums are famously frowned upon in hip-hop due to their lack of direction, but LOUIE is clearly saying something. This Tiny Desk feels like a part of that statement.

_1_BRqBvvdM,Lee Fields: Tiny Desk Concert,"This year's Black History Month celebration at the Tiny Desk features a carefully crafted lineup spanning many genres, generations and walks of life. Each artist represents the best in their class and will be performing at the Tiny Desk for the first time.

Stephen Thompson | February 10, 2023
You can't see it on the screen, but there's a piece of paper taped to the Desk in front of Lee Fields throughout the R&B, blues and soul veteran's long-awaited Tiny Desk debut. It's got the set list, of course, but also an instruction to the singer: ""NO AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION!!!!""

It speaks to Fields' legendary showmanship — he's often been dubbed ""Little JB"" due to his similarities to the hardest-working man in show business — that his team felt a need to rein in his generous impulse to work any crowd before him, knowing the time constraints of a Tiny Desk concert. It speaks further to Fields' showmanship that he ended up ignoring the directive: By the time he got to the set-closing ""Two Jobs,"" which features a call-and-response listing the hours in the day, he was yelling, ""I want y'all to count the hours!""

Though pandemic-era protocols limit the size of the Tiny Desk crowds these days, Fields got the shouts of approval (and participation) he was seeking, as he barreled through three songs from last year's Sentimental Fool and one relative oldie from a career that stretches all the way back to the late '60s: the self-explanatorily titled ""Ladies,"" from his 2009 album My World.

vw-DLcZBfq0,Indigo Girls: Tiny Desk Concert,"Ann Powers | February 7, 2023
A thrill of recognition passed through the crowd gathered around the Tiny Desk when the Indigo Girls began the first song of this set of stone-cold classics. It's ""Closer To Fine"" – arguably the singalong song of the '90s (it was released in 1989) and still a signature for the duo that's been offering life lessons to its fervent fans for nearly four decades. In politically purposeful T-shirts – Emily Saliers wore one reading PROTECT TRANS KIDS, while Amy Ray's was from the environmental justice-oriented Water is Life Festival – the two shared space as only they can, trading off songs each had written while becoming one through their trademark harmonies. The selection they offered provides an ideal brief overview of a legendary career.

""Look Long,"" the title track from the Girls' 15th studio album, released in 2020, featured Saliers in a tenderly contemplative mood, calling for perspective in the midst of struggle. The duo's sole accompanist, Lyris Hung, seized the room's attention on the fiery Ray rocker ""Go,"" and then came ""Kid Fears,"" one of the Girls's most beloved ballads, a dose of compassion that feels as necessary now as it did in 1989. The love in the room at that moment flowed both ways. ""I'm always quoting NPR, so thank you all for your work — all of y'all, collectively,"" Ray said near the set's end. And then as the music began again, the smiles on the Girls' faces showed that they were feeling that wave of gratitude for noble work returned.

0rXXdE6UFRc,Lady Wray: Tiny Desk Concert,"This year's Black History Month celebration at the Tiny Desk features a carefully crafted lineup spanning many genres, generations and walks of life. Each artist represents the best in their class and will be performing at the Tiny Desk for the first time.

Bobby Carter | February 1, 2023
This year's Black History Month celebration at the Tiny Desk features a carefully crafted lineup spanning many genres, generations and walks of life. Each artist represents the best in their class and will be performing at the Tiny Desk for the first time.

As Lady Wray and her band checked into NPR headquarters for their Tiny Desk concert, I overheard her talking about how the excitement to perform kept her up all night. Once upstairs, the band got situated for soundcheck, and as she shook off the nervousness, something happened behind the Desk I'd never heard before. The first note from her mouth was so piercing I thought my ears were deceiving me. It sounded like she was singing through a loudspeaker. Bob Boilen walked over with a puzzled look, and before I could get a word out, I affirmed that we had just heard Lady Wray's natural vocal cords. ""And that's light,"" she said as the band moved on to the next song.

That powerful voice has sustained Nicole Wray's decades-long career. As a teenager, she caught the attention of fellow Virginia natives Missy Elliott and Timbaland, lending vocals to their projects and releasing a hit of her own. She went on to work with other A-listers ranging from Jay-Z to The Black Keys, until she linked up with singer Terri Walker and formed the duo Lady in 2012. The pair split following a brief stint but Wray carried on the band name, prepending it to her own, and began making the music she was born to do solo with Big Crown records.

For her Tiny Desk, Lady Wray brought the classic soul from her last two albums, Queen Alone and Piece of Me, including ""Joy & Pain"" and ""Guilty."" She closed with a rearranged and emotional version of ""Melody,"" named after her daughter.

wTqCthvtL8k,Hermanos Gutiérrez: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | January 31, 2023

There is a slow burning intensity to everything Hermanos Gutiérrez does, including how the duo walked into our offices and saw the Tiny Desk for the first time. “Wow, there it is…” Estevan said quietly to his brother Alejandro.

Hermanos Gutiérrez’s origin story is as intricate as the guitar playing styles of its two members. The brothers have roots in both Switzerland and Ecuador, and the time spent in those two very distinct cultures and geographies gives their sound a tempered European coolness, coupled with a warm, playful energy. From the opening strains of “El Bueno Y El Malo” the brothers’ turn behind the Desk is the perfect introduction to their music if you don’t already know them — and a treat if you already do.

They weave intricate guitar lines over each other that intertwine to the point that if you close your eyes you can’t tell where one begins and the other ends. With a slight touch of a digital loop pedal, Estevan even sneaks in an entire percussion section on bongo and cowbell on “Tres Hermanos.” When my Alt.Latino co-host Anamaria Sayre and I interviewed them on the  podcast last year, I notice that they converse very much like they play: their comments intertwine and layer upon each other’s in the same way they play in unison and against each other in songs like “Thunderbird” and “Pueblo Man.”

a6_RFp5xlGA,Soccer Mommy: Tiny Desk Concert,"Andrew Flanagan | January 18, 2023
When Sophie Allison says to our friends and coworkers assembled around the desk, ""We're finally doin' it,"" she really means it. A little less than exactly three years ago, Allison had just released the wonderful Color Theory as Soccer Mommy; it's an album that marked significant strides in her songwriting and production. A big year was doubtless in store for her and her bandmates... and we all know how that went. The band's visit to the Tiny Desk, scheduled for March 30, 2020, was the first of many to be canceled due to the pandemic.

That time in history required a lot of lemonade-making from all of us; we at NPR Music and beyond were lucky that, not too long after lockdown had sunk its teeth in, Soccer Mommy was the first to record a Tiny Desk (Home) performance for us. It was an early, much-needed sign that life might still be waiting for us on the other end. But, as we've learned well, there's no replacement for proximity.

With all of that indelibly in mind, it was particularly lovely and emotional welcoming Sophie, guitarist Julian Powell, keyboard player Rodrigo Avendano, bassist Nickolas Widener and percussionist Rollum Haas, finally, to the Tiny Desk. Their four-song set, with work from each era of Soccer Mommy's catalog, is beautifully performed and contoured. Welcome back to your debut, Soccer Mommy.

HlDgW6kU3cM,Marc André Hamelin: Tiny Desk Concert,"Tom Huizenga | January 12, 2023
Marc-André Hamelin has a marvelous, curious mind. While we chatted before his Tiny Desk concert, he snooped around the CD shelves near my desk, commenting on a few rarities and sharing his own eclectic tastes, including a crazy YouTube mashup of all 15 Shostakovich symphonies stacked on top of each other. 
 
The Boston-based Montreal native is regarded as one of his generation’s most technically astounding pianists, but he’s no empty virtuoso. His interpretations are probing, precise and warm — keen to bring out humor when necessary. He routinely performs the world’s most treacherous repertoire with his characteristic ease. I’ve witnessed him practically reduce a concert grand to matchsticks, and I’ve heard him tenderly caress a late Schubert sonata.
 
Hamelin’s colossal breadth of repertoire is on display in this smart set of pieces. He begins in the 18th century with the off-kilter antics of C.P.E. Bach — a rondo that stops, starts and swerves with the spirit of improvisation. His limpid rendition of William Bolcom’s “Graceful Ghost Rag” (from 1970) emphasizes the bittersweet harmonies with unhurried elegance.
 
Hamelin saves the rock and roll for last — a piece of his own based on what he calls “possibly the oldest popular song in existence.” Filtered through his lightning-fast fingers, the medieval tune “L’homme armé” struts mischievously, cascades swiftly and expands to a thunderhead of glorious sound.

CG3XDu8aAf8,dodie: Tiny Desk Concert,"Robin Hilton | January 10, 2023
On many levels, this breathtaking Tiny Desk from dodie felt like the ultimate cathartic release. The English singer and her band arrived after more than a year and a half of planning and COVID-related delays; and, this was the final performance we had behind the desk in 2022, capping our long-awaited return to the building after more than two years of pandemic disruption. A lot of us who were lucky enough to see it in person were pretty teary-eyed by the end.

But it was also a release because the music and the way dodie and her band pulled it off were both so magical. Bassist Jillian McKenna is a dodie fan from Canada who joined the band just for this performance after answering a callout on Instagram. The three backup singers are friends who flew in from Los Angeles; the string section was a mix of dodie’s touring band and DC-based artists and fans of Orla Gartland can see her move from piano to guitar and floor tom during the set. dodie herself, who played everything from piano and clarinet to ukulele, and the rest of the band flew in from England solely for the Tiny Desk, arriving on Saturday and flying back Monday not long after playing.

Together, they filled the NPR Music office with songs that radiated with love and life, perfectly recreating the playful, kaleidoscopic spirit of dodie’s 2021 debut album Build a Problem and last year’s Hot Mess EP. Strikingly melodic, whimsical and wistful, dodie’s deep reflections on trauma, letting go and moving on were the perfect close to a year when it felt like we could finally exhale and come together again in song.

uMPFEXq1eSU,Jake Blount: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | January 6, 2023

Jake Blount has an astonishing imagination. While a concert of folk tunes could simply be a singer and perhaps a fiddle or banjo, the young proponent of traditional music brought eight bandmates and told the NPR crowd that they were here to play “Black folk music from the future.” Most of the songs are from Jake Blount’s late-2022 release, The New Faith, on Smithsonian Folkways. It’s a dystopian Afrofuturistic concept album that reinterprets traditional Black spirituals. 

His  band includes the voice of Tiny Desk alum Kaia Kater, rap from Demeanor, fiery electric guitar from Augustus Tritsch and fiddle from George Jackson. It’s a talented crew with a mission to bring the voice, banjo and vivid imaginings of Jake Blount to fruition. “I spent many months during the pandemic alone in my bedroom coming up with these utterly oddball parts that these wonderful people have done a great job learning,” Blount explains. “This is the first time we’ve presented this music with the full instrumentation ever and it means so much to be doing it here.”

Zm1VIGNmPxI,The Smile: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | January 3, 2023

Surely my musical highlight for 2022 was this Tiny Desk concert from The Smile. Just how Radiohead's Thom Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, and Sons of Kemet drummer Tom Skinner were going to perform songs from their sonically adventurous album A Light for Attracting Attention was a puzzle not only to me but to the band. They arrived early, along with saxophonist Robert Stillman, to test out several tunes and figure out just what made sense behind my desk — minus the volume and effects that shape the album's sonic landscape. For roughly 90 minutes, the Tiny Desk crew was treated to a casual rehearsal, witnessing the band's creative companionship work itself out, settling on four songs.

I generally crank up the volume when I listen to The Smile, but as the band settled into the opening song, ""Pana-vision,"" Thom Yorke's fingers gently stroking the piano keys with his voice not much louder, I was drawn in; the mood felt simultaneously mysterious and welcoming with the bass, sax and drums punctuating the now surreal atmosphere.

For keen eyes, you'll see Thom Yorke being handed a guitar for the second tune but all of a sudden he's playing bass while Jonny Greenwood's bass is suddenly a guitar. They had recorded another tune before ""The Smoke,"" but it didn't make the final cut; they weren't happy with their performance. The set ends with my favorite song, ""Skrting On the Surface,"" and we hear the vocals, guitar, bass and drums weaving so perfectly with lyrics that remind us how fragile our lives are and for me how these magical moments can be transcendent.

N6y5DdEHNYA,Westside Boogie: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | December 14, 2022
Westside Boogie's obscure declaration before the final song of his set indicated his detailed knowledge of Tiny Desk concerts. ""I gotta be the first person to bring kids to NPR, right? No, I'm not,"" he exclaims. ""I gotta be the first one with kids in costumes, though."" He's correct. American Football brought a children's choir to the Desk in 2019, so Boogie added flair to that idea for the climactic end to his show. The ""superheroes"" accompanying him for ""Silent Ride"" are local Washington D.C. children representing the future. The vulnerable and solemn nature of this Compton poet's music required minimal adjustment to fit into our space.

""Oh My,"" the song that reeled us back to 2015, was atypical of what he does naturally in the booth. He finds comfort in laying bare vivid images of his personal life, much of which delves into his relationship struggles yet beams with self-awareness and self-criticism. The title of his latest project, More Black Superheroes, is in part dedicated to two recurring themes in his music: his neighborhood and his son. For his Tiny Desk, he played songs from that album , including ""NONCHALANT,"" featuring former Tiny Desk Contest contestant Mamii and other highlights from his catalog. After the performance, in a full circle moment, Boogie signed a poster from our 2015 SXSW showcase, which he was part of, telling us it was his first paid show.

M6Rh-CzEo24,The Mavericks: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | December 12, 2022
When The Mavericks brought their long-running tour to the Tiny Desk, we could hear a well-oiled musical machine that has charmed audiences long enough to earn the band a lifetime achievement award from the Americana Music Association.

From the opening strains of ""Back In Your Arms Again,"" we are treated to one of the best voices in the U.S. — that of Raul Malo. Backed by a smooth shuffle, Malo's voice is propelled by the subtle horn blasts that suggest a Tex-Mex border feel, driven home by the accordion.

""Mujer"" is a track from the band's 2020 album, its first album of all-Spanish material, which features the band's personality shifting from Americana shuffles to Mexican wedding boleros.

""Come Unto Me"" is a Mavericks chestnut and gives a glimpse into why the band is such a crowd favorite. The song filters that bolero feel of the previous song into a slow burner with a shouted chorus at the end that usually has the crowd on its feet and singing along.

The Mavericks are one of the best live shows out on the road these days and masters at bringing new fans into their fold. This performance gives us all a good idea of how the band weaves that magic.

PxKHo8kiBG4,Eliane Elias: Tiny Desk Concert,"Suraya Mohamed | December 9, 2022
Eliane Elias and her team arrived the day before this Tiny Desk to check out the space and audition the piano. We all worked to make sure that every detail, including the sound and cameras, were just right. And it turned out great. The meticulousness and care that went into this concert is evident in the brilliance of the performance.

Elias and her band brought a little bit of Brazil with this commanding performance of the best of the Brazilian jazz genre. Watch how the piano keys sit comfortably under Elias' hands, and how the dynamic syncopation in her percussive left hand complements the beautiful melodic lines of her right, both blending perfectly with the musicianship of her talented band. This superb combination of Afro-Latin rhythms, like samba and bossa nova, with straight-ahead styles make for really infectious music.

Eliane Elias was born in São Paulo, Brazil, and grew up in a musical household. By the time she was 10 she was already a huge jazz fan. Today, she has her own fandom and a 31-album catalog that includes her latest release, Quietude, and Mirror Mirror, a project with Chick Corea and Chucho Valdés that won both a Grammy award and a Latin Grammy for best Latin jazz album earlier this year.

qyPquozbCOQ,Alex G: Tiny Desk Concert,"Marissa Lorusso | December 7, 2022
""I don't have a lot to say,"" Alex Giannascoli, who performs as Alex G, says with a laugh after his first song behind the Tiny Desk. Judging from his discography alone, that's not something you might ordinarily accuse the Philly singer-songwriter of: nine full-length albums in the last dozen years, in addition to a couple EPs and a film soundtrack. His prodigious output of melodic, peculiar indie rock has earned him a cult-beloved status. True, he got to play guitar on a couple Frank Ocean tracks — but for a more accurate indication of the fervor of his fanbase, turn your attention to the internet: the hours-long playlists of unreleased Alex G demos painstakingly assembled by fans on YouTube, for example, or the raucous chatter among his fans on message boards.

At the Tiny Desk, Alex G and his band dialed down the volume for a handful of songs from across his vast discography. They started with a couple songs from his stellar new album, God Save The Animals, and also played some deeper cuts: ""Gretel,"" a wonderfully creepy track from 2019's House of Sugar, and ""Snot,"" the closer from 2015's Beach Music. Under the layers of electronics, experimentation and vocal effects on Alex G's studio records, you might lose sight of Giannascoli's primary strength as a songwriter and the emotional core of his music. But at the Tiny Desk, the stripped-down sound only underscored the sturdiness of his craft — no explanation required.

6dkDepLX0rk,Stromae: Tiny Desk Concert,"Stephen Thompson | December 5, 2022
Belgian dance-pop superstar Stromae puts on one of the best live shows in the world — here’s a two-song set from 2015, presented as evidence — but his stage presentation is tough to strip down. To say nothing of the light show, Stromae’s throbbingly impeccable arrangements involve the extensive use of pre-recorded tracks, all of which are frowned upon at the Tiny Desk. So, given a simple three-word assignment (“no preset sounds”), his team set about re-creating Stromae’s music so that it could be performed in real time.

This involved more gleaming tech than we could have ever imagined when we launched Tiny Desk concerts nearly 15 years ago — veritable banks of laptops, mixers and synthesizers, with multiple producers working out of frame — but damned if every sound in this set wasn’t crafted and played live on the spot. Stromae and his team had to come a day early for hours of setup and rehearsals, and even the band’s clothing was handpicked from the singer’s fashion line, but what they produced felt loose-limbed and organic in the spirit of the series.

It helps that, as heard on this year’s outstanding Multitude, Stromae’s songs draw from a deep well of lived emotion. Backed by three members of the Bulgarian women’s choir Yasna Voices, Stromae kicked off his set with “L’enfer,” a wrenching acknowledgement of suicidal thoughts. The song’s chorus, translated to English, reads, “Sometimes I’ve had suicidal thoughts and I’m not proud of it / Sometimes you feel it’d be the only way to silence them / All these thoughts putting me through hell.”

From there, Stromae’s song selections conveyed lighter moods, but even his most danceable tracks contain undercurrents of darkness and conflict: “Santé” is a toast to those who can’t celebrate, “Alors on danse” (from 2009’s Cheese) embraces dancing as a way to drown out life’s hardships and “Mon amour” attempts to reassure a lover against a backdrop of infidelity and dysfunction. On its own, each track is a heady cocktail of painstaking craft and hard-won joy. Taken together, they form a portrait of a world-class showman at the height of his powers.

C3Y_thL0juU,The A's: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | December 1, 2022
It was clear from the outset, those very first harmonies, that this was to be a playful, fun-filled day at the Tiny Desk. For one thing, the two A's, Amelia and Alexandra, are Tiny Desk alums. Amelia Meath made her Tiny Desk concert debut in 2015 with Nick Sanborn as Sylvan Esso. She returned in 2019 with her Vermont college mates Mountain Man which includes Alexandra Sauser-Monnig along with Molly Erin Sarlé. Alexandra's project, Daughter of Swords, was here not long before the COVID outbreak.

This summer, Amelia and Alexandra put out a delightful album of songs titled Fruit, including the yodeling a cappella cowboy tune that opens this Tiny Desk, ""When The Bloom Is On the Sage."" Other songs include the folk song ""Swing and Turn Jubilee,"" accompanied by Alexandra on acoustic guitar, with Amelia gently stomping her thick-soled Buffalo sneakers on stones to keep the beat.

Amelia and Alexandra's identical leaf-and-bird-patterned dresses, dark lipstick and even darker sunglasses add an eeriness to these sublime songs. This leads us to the final song in the set, a tune Amelia says will guide her friends on what to do upon leaving this earth. The lyrical instructions in ""When I Die"" include singing and dancing, drinking to life, flowers to perfume the air and a bonfire to light the way home. Even in the face of death, The A's kept a smile on my face.

qHNUeBK8k7Q,beabadoobee: Tiny Desk Concert,"Hazel Cills | November 29, 2022
Beatrice Laus, who performs as beabadoobee, possesses the sort of soft, lilting voice that often runs the risk of getting lost in her signature sound — a mix of grungy, ’90s rock and noisy dream pop. Mix Laus the wrong way in a live setting and you miss out on vocals that lend whatever song they’re paired with an undeniable sweetness and sincerity.

But in her Tiny Desk performance, beabadoobee drops her rock and roll tendencies to a low simmer, giving her voice ample room to shine in a collection of songs suited for our quiet little corner. She begins with “See You Soon” on her acoustic guitar, the first of a string of tracks from her latest album, Beatopia, backed by a trio of strings and her longtime guitarist and collaborator Jacob Bugden (who she at one point politely ribs for failing at a recent attempt at crowd surfing while on tour). 

“Ripples” and “The Perfect Pair” follow, before she closes out with an unreleased song. “I could have played ‘Coffee,’ but I’m not,” she says, laughing, referring to her 2017 viral hit, a song that sounds so simple given how far her music has come. Instead she plays what she refers to as “Glue song,” a love song about a romance so strong it sticks its lovers together — you guessed it — like glue.

IG76Rf28MQA,Santigold: Tiny Desk Concert,"Stephen Thompson | November 21, 2022
The Tiny Desk often forces radical changes to an artist's sound and style, but Santigold faced more than most. There was the live band assembled for the occasion, which included George Lewis Jr. (aka Twin Shadow) on bass and drummer Chuck Treece, who's worked with everyone from Bad Brains to Billy Joel. There was the lack of a microphone — and, by extension, vocal amplification — not to mention the fact that, as Santigold herself noted, ""I don't know what I'm doing up here with no dancers.""

Fortunately, Santi White has been revising and reinventing her sound for two decades now. If anything, performing her genre-straddling R&B and electro-pop with a live band represented a return to roots, given that she'd spent the early aughts singing in the punk band Stiffed — with Treece on drums, in fact. Everything about this set feels like the culmination of hard work, from the custom arrangements to the singer's hair/hat combo, an architectural marvel that warrants closer inspection. Given that Santigold had canceled her North American tour weeks earlier — she flew into D.C. for this occasion — it's a wonder her Tiny Desk debut even happened. Thank goodness it did.

8Yu6CQcnQ_A,Sheku Kanneh-Mason: Tiny Desk Concert,"Tom Huizenga | November 15, 2022
One measure of an artist’s popularity is how long it takes to book them for a Tiny Desk concert. In the case of British cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason, it took about three years. Granted, the pandemic got in the way, but ever since his 2018 breakthrough performance at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, he’s been -- needless to say -- in demand. Nearly 2 billion people worldwide saw his royal performance on television. 

At the Tiny Desk, Kanneh-Mason played for only a handful of NPR staffers, and the performance felt like a direct communication from his luminous cello (built in 1700) to our heartstrings. It was especially true in Kanneh-Mason’s own arrangement of “Myfanwy,” the mournful Welsh folk song the cellist first heard from his grandmother. Accompanying himself with left hand pizzicato, Kanneh-Mason makes his instrument sing like a sad old Welshman with a tear in his eye. 

Aside from his expressive playing, Kanneh-Mason excels at arranging pop songs for his instrument. “No Woman, No Cry,” one of his calling cards, explores the tender and bittersweet side of the Bob Marley classic.  

Still only 23, Kanneh-Mason’s stature commands the attention of composers. Last year, the fine young Brit Edmund Finnis wrote a set of solo preludes for Kanneh-Mason. The music reveals the cello’s many voices, from growling urgency to supple soliloquy to full-throated cry. 

While we can’t guarantee 2 billion views on our platforms, those who do watch this Tiny Desk performance will witness a rising young star who, whether he knows it or not, represents nothing less than the future of classical music.

cx67TnQrqcg,The Lion King: Tiny Desk Concert,"Josh Rogosin | November 11, 2022
Actors and musicians on Broadway have a grueling performance schedule: eight shows a week with only Mondays off. Yet the band and cast of The Lion King were ecstatic to spend their one free day traveling from New York to Washington, D.C. to celebrate 25 years of the iconic musical with a performance at NPR’s Tiny Desk.

Many of the songs written by Elton John and Tim Rice will be familiar — like the Oscar-winning “Can You Feel the Love Tonight” and “Hakuna Matata.” But the cast also treated the enthusiastic Tiny Desk crowd to songs written just for the stage. “They Live In You” wasn’t in the original movie, but is sung in the show by Mufasa (L. Steven Taylor) to his cub Simba (Brandon A. McCall). The young lioness Nala sings “Shadowland'', another gem from the musical sung by Pearl Khwezi (the first South African cast in the role).

Infused throughout the music of The Lion King is spine-tingling African rhythm and language. It’s as captivating as the groundbreaking costume design by director, co-writer and artist Julie Taymor. The team at Disney Theatrical sent the masks of Simba and Nala in time to be prominently displayed on the desk during the concert. Examining their details up close gave me chills — just like the ones I felt watching the show at the New Amsterdam Theatre, way back in 1997 when the musical first debuted.

eAzClkn3zYw,Ezra Collective: Tiny Desk Concert,"Suraya Mohamed | November 10, 2022
The day before The Ezra Collective’s Tiny Desk concert, the band members practiced for hours at a nearby community music space and the next morning, they walked in the door giddy and ready to go. The warm-up was good, but once we started to record, a crazy intensity and energy spilled out into the room. They were fierce and fun and all of their solos were on fire. 

The band makes amazing jazz music and mixes it with a fusion of other genres like Afrobeat, hip-hop and grime. The London-based band was supposed to play this Tiny Desk concert in 2020, but then, as bandleader and phenom drummer Femi Koleoso put it, “the world collapsed.” Here it is now, rockin’ hard with the highest level of musicianship and technique.

Before coming to NPR, Koleoso had just finished a world tour with the group Gorillaz. He met up with his bandmates in Washington, D.C., to play this concert and kick off promotion for the band’s newly released sophomore album, Where I’m Meant To Be. He explained on Instagram that he loves the album title because it's vague and specific at the same time, just like his band, a multifaceted complement of contrasting attributes. The first two songs in this set are from that new album while the last, “Chapter 7,” is from the group’s 2016 EP. Throughout the set, watch how keyboard player Joe Armon-Jones barely stays on his seat and hear how the audience couldn’t keep quiet. After the concert, the spirit of the music lingered for a long time and the day ended with pictures, hugs and plenty of smiles.

7odxBDg-7JE,Lizzy McAlpine: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | November 8, 2022
While there's a quiet element to Lizzy McAlpine's music, there's also an explosive element of electronics, electric guitars and drums on her 2022 album five seconds flat that feels cinematic. So when Lizzy told us that all she'd need for her Tiny Desk concert were some microphones and a few acoustic guitars, I was surprised — curious and eager to hear her rise to the challenge of our intimate setting.

Her backing vocalists are a trio coincidentally and appropriately called Tiny Habits, a group she met on Instagram about a year ago. ""I wanted to recontextualize the songs on the album with just vocals and guitar,"" Lizzy says. ""I feel like that's how I write most of my songs anyway. I just wanted them to be more intimate."" And with those harmonies, Lizzy's gently expressive voice and a bit of acoustic guitar, the 23-year-old's stories came through powerfully clear.

u3axBzTe2-I,NoSo: Tiny Desk Concert,"Elle Mannion | November 4, 2022
Baek Hwong, the artist who performs as NoSo, arrived at NPR’s headquarters on a sunny Friday afternoon that followed a week of relentless rain in Washington, D.C. The change in weather was apt for the Los Angeles-based artist whose music often sheds light on dark times. 

I first discovered NoSo when they entered the Tiny Desk Contest back in 2019. Even though they didn’t win, their spectacular guitar playing, memorable hooks and sentimental lyricism left a lasting impression. They bring all those elements to their Tiny Desk set, in which they’re accompanied by musicians Marian Li-Pino on drums and Jayla Tang on violin. NoSo’s soft-spoken nature complements their musical dexterity to create the kind intimate performance that really shines in the close quarters behind the Desk.

Across the three-song set, Hwong sings about the “quiet suburbia” they grew up in and reflects on feelings about their evolving gender identity. The final song of the set, “Everything I’ve Got,” is an aching portrayal of the way confidence and longing can be upended by gender dysphoria; before playing the song, Hwong shares that they’ve “healed a lot” since writing it. “I know if I was born fairly, I’d be it / I’ll love you with everything I’ve got,” they sing quietly over a swelling violin and an audience of sniffling NPR staff. 

NoSo reflects on their adolescence — often granting newfound compassion to their younger self — across their debut album, Stay Proud Of Me, which came out earlier this year. They say releasing that record and playing a Tiny Desk three years after submitting to the Contest feels like “a real full-circle moment.” Toward the end of the set, Hwong smiles and admits: “This is a dream come true.”

2PQnfVlRzqE,King Princess: Tiny Desk Concert,"Hazel Cills | November 2, 2022
There is a sly, casual sense of humor that permeates the music of Mikaela Mullaney Straus, who writes and performs as King Princess. Her songs mix the emotions of crushing love and lust with playful asides of self-deprecation, all of which make for a unique, self-assured style. And that self-assuredness is on full display in the indie pop singer's Tiny Desk concert, featuring King Princess performing three songs from her most recent album, Hold On Baby.

Lyrics like, ""You look the same. Did you stop smoking weed? Or trying to please your dad?"" from the opening ""Cursed"" — an ode to the difficulties of encountering an old, toxic friend — burn a little brighter in the naked, largely acoustic sound of King Princess' set. Partway through the next song, the loving ""Winter is Hopeful,"" explicitly inspired by the artist's girlfriend, she takes a beat to laugh at a set of bar chimes being rung to perfection. ""I love that,"" she says, before returning to sing, her voice vibrating with a soulful urgency.

""If you're feeling saucy today, you can join in with the band,"" King Princess says before her finale, ""Let Us Die,"" a punchy, fuzzed-out pop-rock song on the record that transforms here into a guitar-strummed jam session. ""If the only way to love you is to let us die,"" she sings, her lyrics pulling together images of a break-up that's like a car driven off a cliff, poison-drinking and fingers stuck in sockets, ""I will if I have to."" Is this girl for real? If the gut-punching confidence with which King Princess sings here is any indication, yes, she is.

RKblHbJE1jI,Symba: Tiny Desk Concert,"Sheldon Pearce | October 28, 2022
The Bay Area rapper Symba is a capable storyteller, but he is best known for his bars. ""Can I rap for y'all?"" he asks after performing ""Can't Win For Nothing."" ""'Cause that wasn't really me rapping; that was me guiding y'all through a bad day. Let me spit some lyrics."" Fair enough. He did tear through a L.A. Leakers freestyle, during a visit to Power 106 in 2020, turning many heads and even earning Dr. Dre's hard-won approval. But in his Tiny Desk concert, he demonstrates a keen ability to supplement his charged, freestyler's energy, balancing high-octane wordplay with crisp scene-setting. Donning a Reese Cooper varsity jacket, a white tee, ripped jeans and assorted jewelry, and backed by a band sporting black, Symba brought an even greater intimacy to his songs of determination.

The concert opens with a few standout singles: He sets the tone by swaggering through ""Don't Condone,"" gleefully brandishing his King James cosign, before diving into the solemn misadventures of ""Can't Win For Nothing."" His small, six-person ensemble brings warmth and color out of his beats, particularly on the Dre-produced ""Never End Up Broke,"" which breaks down into a lush alternate arrangement fit for the Blue Note jazz club.

After warming up, Symba works through several gripping cuts from his recent project with DJ Drama, Results Take Time. As he closes out his set with stirring renditions of the legacy-pondering ""GOAT"" and the status-affirming ""Never Change,"" we bear witness to the truth of the album's title. When he raps, ""I took the long route, not the wrong route,"" it feels like a prophecy fulfilled, proof that talent is always reinforced by work ethic.

71XmVyRCe4M,S.G. Goodman: Tiny Desk Concert,"Ann Powers | October 26, 2022
S.G. Goodman gazes off into the distance as she begins the first song in this Tiny Desk session, rocking her body from side to side, connecting with a force inside and also just out of reach: maybe it's something in her past or the image of a person she holds dear, or maybe it's simply fierce, ragged hope. ""I see all my love coming back to me — I can see it!"" she wails in her piercing, haunted soprano. Her band revs its engine beneath her as she testifies about a rock and roll epiphany. As drummer Stephen Montgomery and bassist Mark Sloan push the rhythm harder and guitarist Michael Ruth lays down some pure-energy riffs, she squeezes her eyes shut and bears down on her guitar. Music, Goodman's songs show us, is a route to both survival and transcendence.

A proud and ever-questioning Southerner who invokes Tyler Childers, Dolly Parton and her own Kentucky accent in her between-song banter, Goodman released her debut album Old Time Feeling early on in the pandemic and her astounding Teeth Marks in June of this year. Goodman's songs cultivate a direct gaze as they confront grief and stump for understanding. The two others offered here, ""If You Were Someone I Loved"" and ""Space and Time,"" show the breadth of expression she and her band achieve with their feet firmly planted on the ground of grassroots rock, the kind that echoes from bar stages and garages in Hickman, Kentucky, and countless small American towns like it. Goodman's stories and her sound are very particular, but she's a hero with big arms, an ordinary woman learning how to keep on keeping on. You can see it, that engagement and resilience, in every moment of this performance.

-vwiDF8pD1c,The Crossing: Tiny Desk Concert,"Tom Huizenga | October 24, 2022
When the vocal ensemble named The Crossing — also known as “America’s most astonishing choir” — warmed up behind the Tiny Desk, it reminded me once again how joyful and powerful it can feel to sing together with a group of people. Singing in a choir is a music-making activity shared by more than 54 million Americans, according to recent research by Chorus America.
While the Philadelphia-based choir and its forward-thinking director Donald Nally enjoy the accolades, including a pair of Grammy awards, the most important thing for them is the clear, precise singing of brand new music. They have commissioned and debuted nearly 110 new works by composers including Caroline Shaw, DavidSo  Lang, John Luther Adams, Gavin Bryars and Shara Nova, whose brand new work, Titration, was the focus of this performance. The Crossing performed the work’s world premiere in Montana just four days before visiting NPR. 
Nova’s music, which “looks at how we deal with difficult emotions,” she says, requires a wide range of tone and color from the choir. Voices softly enter in translucent layers, a reminder of Renaissance traditions, or bark in a way that conjures up the early American shape-note singing style.
During sound check, Nally stopped the singers to coax a slightly different pronunciation or tweak a volume. And through it all, they sang with power and precision — and with smiles on their faces.

2aX8svdJjZo,Leyla McCalla: Tiny Desk Concert,"Ann Powers | October 20, 2022
“How much does a memory weigh?” Leyla McCalla sings halfway through her Tiny Desk performance in a voice that feels like it’s floating in water – swimming, drowning, escaping, returning home – as it intertwines with the seaweed lines of Nahum Zdybel’s guitar. That question, from her ballad “Memory Song,” is central to the music she and her band offer in this sparkling, thoughtful set. This music originated within McCalla's theater piece about independent station Radio Haiti, Breaking the Thermometer To Hide the Fever, which she transformed into one of 2022’s most compelling albums. From the driving, danceable call to revolution “Dodinin” to “Nan Fon Bwa,” written by renowned guitarist Frantz Casseus and now a showcase for McCalla’s funky cello work, she and her band — all players deeply immersed in Haiti’s rhythms and songlines — enact a historical journey that honors a nation born in revolution and still fighting, despite unfathomable hardship, today.

McCalla’s parents immigrated to New York as kids, during François Duvalier’s murderous regime. “I’ve been curious about that period in their lives and Haitian history for a long time,” she says, introducing “Fort Dimanche,” which samples an interview conducted by Radio Haiti’s cofounder Michèle Montas about life within the country’s most notoriously brutal prison. The song begins quietly, led by McCalla’s circular banjo lines, then builds a dream of freedom through the rhythms of Markus Schwartz's congas and Pete Olyinciw’s bowed and plucked upright bass. Memory’s shape is latticework, delicate and non-linear, and McCalla’s songs honor its partial revelations with the grace of deep attention.

4dd7WejIFi8,Joyce Wrice: Tiny Desk Concert,"Ashley Pointer | October 18, 2022
Warning: It’s hard to keep still when listening to the infectious music of effervescent R&B powerhouse Joyce Wrice. Side effects may include an intense head bop, the occasional stank face and a mean two-step. Wrice’s Tiny Desk concert is a stunning display of her talents, showing us where the San Diego bred, Los Angeles based singer has been and where she’s going next. Clad in all white and backed by a band wearing matching black Nike tracksuits and sneakers, they exude a vibe reminiscent of a family.

The concert commences with a sampling of her refreshing (and NPR favorite) 2021 debut album Overgrown, that established her as a major voice in contemporary R&B. Accompanied by a six-piece band of tasteful musicians, Wrice opens with a soulful live arrangement of “Chandler,” before smoothly transitioning into “Falling In Love.” That funky bassline you hear? Courtesy of the one and only Dernst “D'Mile” Emile II, who executive produced Overgrown and last graced the Tiny Desk for Lucky Daye’s concert in 2019.

We get a taste of Wrice’s new pop influenced EP Motive, which takes an energetic turn away from her more soulful debut. As she closes out the set with “Bittersweet Goodbyes,” and the Kaytranada produced “Iced Tea,” both written in collaboration with Mack Keane (who’s seen here holding it down on keys), we witness an assured artist motivated to make you move.

xNm2JuN2WLQ,Farruko: Tiny Desk Concert,"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Latinx Heritage Month with an El Tiny takeover, featuring Jessie Reyez, Susana Baca and more musicians from all corners of Latinidad.

Fi O'Reilly | October 14, 2022
Last year, Farruko's song ""Pepas"" felt almost omnipresent. The bacchanalian party anthem for getting trashed at the club seemed to blast out from every passing car and bodega I walked by. But since releasing the song, Carlos Reyes aka Farruko, has undergone a spiritual transformation, even renouncing the song's message and taking the time to focus on his family and his developing relationship with God.

His Tiny Desk reflects this new perspective. At NPR HQ, Farruko adapted his quintessential flow to a much more intimate setting, one that highlights the striking pivot from the party-filled lifestyle described in so much of his earlier catalog. Instead of musings on drugs, perreo and excess, he opens his set with ""En La Mía (Remix)"" — an introspection on the healing power of music and faith — before moving onto a (revised) rendition of ""Pepas,"" that concentrates on the limitations of fame and staying true to yourself.

He emphasizes the importance of counting your blessings in ""No Entienden,"" reflecting on past mistakes in ""My Lova"" and the new track ""Viaje"" and spreading positivity in ""Gracias (Remix)."" It's an ideal send-off for this year's Latinx Heritage Month — blessings por nuestras herencias and hope for the future.

abb3ObvdBus,Tokischa: Tiny Desk Concert,"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Latinx Heritage Month with an El Tiny takeover, featuring Jessie Reyez, Susana Baca and more musicians from all corners of Latinidad.

Stefanie Fernández | October 12, 2022 
Tokischa came to NPR with a set of arrangements which, a conversation after the performance, she called ""a little more Tiny,"" reworking her dembow tracks in a melange of other Caribbean and Latin American genres. True to her identity as an artist whose performance is aimed squarely at disarming respectability politics, she doesn't sanitize the originals. Instead, her performance subverts expectations by foregrounding her celebration of female sexual autonomy, queerness and desire against a backdrop of popular folk genres. The juxtaposition succeeds uncannily, the kind of artistic strength that lands on the ears of people in power like a threat.

The dembow avant-gardist has incensed conservative pundits in the Dominican Republic and abroad. Her unfiltered expression has sparked moral panic and, elsewhere, drawn justifiable criticism. She opens with ""Perra"" — a collaboration she originally recorded with J Balvin and the video for which was criticized for racist imagery against Black women and was eventually deleted from YouTube. It's a surprising choice for an opener, even more so as a demure bossa nova. Tokischa lilts the song's chorus and playfully points to the audience.

Her distinctive voice and flow pair deftly with the switch-ups across Caribbean genres, from a bachata version of ""Hola"" to reggae on ""Somos Iguales"" and a mambo ""Delincuente,"" the latter complete with a call-and-response that features an NPR audience for the first time probably ever responding ""bellaca"" (""horny"").

""ESTILAZO"" is completely transformed, the crisp house original slowed to a languid son backed by a tumbao piano riff in the neighborhood of ""Chan Chan."" The lyrics — among them ""Lesbianismo entre mujeres, larga vida homosexual,"" (""Lesbianism between women, long homosexual life"") and ""Música con letras sucias, una suciedad divina"" (""Music with dirty lyrics, a divine filthiness"") — build like a manifesto, recasting what oppressors have deemed perverse as divine instead.

Each song is a surprise, and most of all the closer, ""Kilos De Amor,"" a currently unreleased corrido. The genre experiments aren't just an El Tiny detour, but a signifier of an artist who both deeply knows where she comes from and who isn't afraid to see how far she can go.

aKWV7b3j5P0,Carla Morrison: Tiny Desk Concert,"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Latinx Heritage Month with an El Tiny takeover, featuring Jessie Reyez, Susana Baca and more musicians from all corners of Latinidad.

Felix Contreras | October 7, 2022
The magic of Carla Morrison’s music is in the intimacy of her lyrics and her voice. I’ve seen the Mexican singer-songwriter woo small audiences and large crowds with an elegance that’s only grown since her first releases.That power to mesmerize is on full display during her time behind the desk with four songs that draw on the things that have earned Morrison stans all over Latin America.

After the opening piano strains of “Contigo,” we’re treated to a display of how Morrison’s lyrics can sometimes move the singer herself as she confesses to shedding a few tears during the chorus.

There is an underlying sense of purpose and release in this music as she explains why she took a break from her music career and how that influences the passion behind her latest album, El Renacimiento. 

In fact, even as she introduces “Encontrarme” as an ode to self discovery and recovery, Morrison displays where the emotion in her lyrics come from as she tears up explaining the origin of the song.

“I’m so emotional,” she says through tears, “because it’s been a long time since I’ve been touring and I took a really long time to come back to myself and to be able to sing again. Just to be here means a lot to me because I do watch NPR Tiny Desk at home!”
 
As if it couldn't get any more emotional, Morrison introduces “Te Regalo” by introducing the object of her melodic affections, her husband and co-producer, Alejandro Jiménez. 
 
I’m not saying you should have a box of tissues nearby while you watch Carla Morrison’s performance, but it came in handy for me.

wSl5_RDCfrQ,Jessie Reyez: Tiny Desk Concert,"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Latinx Heritage Month with an ""El Tiny"" takeover, featuring Jessie Reyez, Susana Baca and more musicians from all corners of Latinidad.

Anamaria Sayre | September 30, 2022
Beer cans and hair brushes may not be typical percussive tools, but typical is as irrelevant as tradition is amorphous when you're an immigrant-raised, Colombian-Canadian kid whose music is as much about navigating life on your terms as it is about holding your head up in the rip current of love.

Jessie Reyez's legendary layers — vocal dynamism, cross-genre playfulness, unapologetic realness — were on full display at her El Tiny concert. Complete with strings, horns and musical direction from Tiny Desk alum Matthew Burnett (whose credits also include Daniel Caesar's Tiny Desk), Reyez deftly danced between tracks with the assuredness of a true reina harnessing her vulnerability on stage.

Reyez opens the performance with ""MOOD,"" the starting track of her newly released second album, Yessie. Here, she uses her room-altering belting prowess to rearrange the chorus, relegating the recorded melody to the background vocals and positioning her sample of the timeless track ""Los Caminos de la Vida"" at center stage. Transitioning to a mash-up of ""MUTUAL FRIEND"" and ""FIGURES,"" she delivers a heart-shifting, string-driven performance of the two. Then, she seamlessly navigates a musician and formation change-up as she glides through the playful ""ONLY ONE"" and heartfelt mash-up of ""FOREVER"" and ""IMPORTED."" Circling back to the second half of ""MOOD,"" she easily slides into a more upbeat, cumbia-infused rendition of the soulful track. Picking up her makeshift güiro — a PBR can — she melds joy in dance and pain in song with the kind of effortless and expert execution of a woman who intimately knows in-betweenness and, better yet, understands how to bask in the beauty of its nuance.

aQcXSoamCVA,Girl Ultra: Tiny Desk Concert,"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Latinx Heritage Month with an ""El Tiny"" takeover, featuring Jessie Reyez, Susana Baca and more musicians from all corners of Latinidad.

Stefanie Fernández | Sept. 21, 2022
Girl Ultra's music is never one thing for long. After coming up in Mexico City's alt R&B scene, Mariana de Miguel built on that premise with experiments in house, bolero, pop and punk, fused with her own distinct glint. Her El Tiny performance is an effortless flash of all she is capable of and of the commanding performance she's finessed over her career. Even the onomatopoeic chorus of house track ""BOMBAY"" translates seamlessly to the desk.

Slowed and acoustic as it is, the El Tiny version of ""Punk"" captures the frenetic rush of the original, itself an alt transfiguration of Gwen Stefani's ""Bubble Pop Electric"" that interpolates its pop chorus and tailors it to the allure of going out in the south side of Mariana de Miguel's hometown of Mexico City. ""Dime tú que voy a hacer con este feeling,"" (""You tell me what I'm going to do with this feeling"") she asks, ostensibly of the person she's singing about. But it's also a question that speaks to the mutability of her performance: effusive and commanding, but never lacking a controlled restraint as it evolves. As she sings in ""DameLove,"" ""feelings always come and go.""

She begins her El Tiny performance of that song by playing a few moments of the recorded version. Cuco's voice and hers float in from the drum machine, warped, as she flutters her fingers in front of her face, cultivating mystery against the familiarity of the setting for a solo rendition of the song that feels even more intimate.

She describes the final song of her set, ""Ella Tú y Yo"" from 2019's Nuevos Aires, as ""about finding a third one in a relationship – which is pretty common these days."" Here, she reworks the R&B ballad into a simmering indie rock churn, its titular phrase whispered with a soft wince.

Just one album and an EP into her career, Girl Ultra has already commanded change — as necessary and sometimes difficult as it can be — as a driver of expression. Here, it's thrilling.

7p78XATPcyg,Omar Apollo: Tiny Desk Concert,"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Latinx Heritage Month with an ""El Tiny"" takeover, featuring Jessie Reyez, Susana Baca and more musicians from all corners of Latinidad.

Fi O’Reilly | September 15, 2022
What a way to get our second annual El Tiny series going! Omar Apollo kicks off Latinx Heritage Month with a full-band rendition of ""En El Olvido,"" backed by Las Mariachis Lindas, as he channels a childhood spent listening to Juan Gabriel into his performance of the Mexican corrido. 

In the eternal wisdom of Alt.Latino co-host Anamaria Sayre, it's not a Mexican party until someone starts crying, and Apollo embraces esta melancolía as the band slips into the easy R&B number ""Evergreen.""  ""We're about to get more sad,"" he says to the crowd with a grin. 

Despite the heartbreak and unrequited love songs, there's a sense of ease in this Tiny Desk concert — an easy camaraderie among the group as the members sing through ""Evergreen"" and ""Petrified"" before finishing with the (slightly) more upbeat ""Endlessly.""  El corazón puede estar adolorido, but in community, the pain never seems hopeless. 

As Apollo's Tiny Desk comes to an end, he offers the audience a homework assignment for self-improvement, for putting the negative behind you and making yourself available to participate in building community: ""I want y'all to think about something,” he says. “I want you to go home, I want you to meditate and I want you to just burn the bridge."" He laughs. “I’m playing!” But as his and the band’s joyful energy attests, in the world of Omar Apollo, there’s only room for building each other up.

Ffs7szmBmCU,Allison Russell: Tiny Desk Concert,"Ann Powers: September 14, 2022 
“I am grateful and I am proud for this circle of goddesses,” said Allison Russell during her joyful, rousing Tiny Desk set, reaching toward the six women surrounding her. Russell has cultivated this band’s harmoniousness in the year she’s been touring in support of her astounding, unclassifiable album Outside Child, which tells the singer’s life story, from her childhood escaping abuse through an itinerant adolescence and young adulthood anchored, finally, by the love and community she’s found as a feminist and a music-maker. This group — three string players, two guitarists, a drummer and Russell on her banjo and clarinet — embodies healing community, and its interplay and gospelized group vocals turbo-charged every song.
 
Russell, who burned a little palo santo wood and placed portraits of Prince and Joni Mitchell nearby as talismans before performing, began her set by invoking the ancestors with “Quasheba.” She continued with the incantatory “4th Day Prayer,” a spell cast to undo the oppression of childhood trauma. The intense interplay of cellists Larissa Maestro and Monique Ross and violinist Chauntee Ross undergirded the propulsive arrangement. The blues-rooted “Nightflyer” followed; drummer Megan Coleman’s green satin angel-wing sleeves shimmered as she marked a beat that guitarists Joy Clark and Mandy Fer intensified. Then came “You’re Not Alone,” a song Russell originally wrote as part of the Americana supergroup Our Native Daughters, just rereleased as a duet with Brandi Carlile. “La musique nous réunit / Une famille,” Russell sang in Québécois French. “A family,” she repeated. That’s what her music makes.

7rzGNL28Js0,Angélique Kidjo: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | September 12, 2022

Today we celebrate the 1,000th concert the Tiny Desk team has captured and published, and I can't imagine a more inspiring spirit to help us celebrate than Angélique Kidjo. Originally from the West African country of Benin, the singer and activist plays a crucial role in spreading the music of Africa and the spirit of love in all that she does.

When I started the Tiny Desk series in April 2008, I never imagined its impact. So many artists' voices have been raised and shared with music fans worldwide through these performances. When Angélique was preparing for her Tiny Desk concert, she thought it would be a good idea to watch some past concerts for inspiration. It's then she saw Sampa The Great's home concert from Zambia and immediately reached out in hopes of collaborating. Now here they are, at NPR, brought together by a series that has been blessed with so much talent and a global audience with big ears and open arms.

Angélique Kidjo's band drives the energy and melody as they perform songs from her 2021 album Mother Nature and then dig back a decade to perform the song ""Afirika,"" encouraging strength for the African people. The celebration concludes as Angélique Kidjo pays tribute to her friend and mentor Miriam Makeba by performing her 1967 global hit, ""Pata Pata."" It was a lovely way to shine a light on how we can impact each other's lives through music.

gsaZRcL-OTQ,JID: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | September 8, 2022
Everything JID does is intricately detailed. He seems to care much more than the average emcee, and throughout this entire production, I felt his strong desire to get it right. The weight was lifted from his shoulders at the midway point of the set as he turned to his band, saying, ""We're pretty hot guys. We're pretty f***ing hot."" In this performance, recorded weeks before the release of his now widely praised third studio album, The Forever Story, the East Atlanta native performs songs from the album live for the first time, plus career-defining songs in ways we've never heard before.

The origin of JID makes up the puzzle pieces in The Forever Story. It's the story of a kid with derailed football dreams, searching for purpose until it found him. These are tales that many kids from the inner city can relate to — but what sets JID's story apart is that nobody raps like him. His music casts a wide net, considering history, family and hometown, and connecting with hip-hop enthusiasts and music nerds alike.

In these stripped-down versions of songs like ""Never"" and ""Surround Sound,"" the focus is on how JID can manipulate pitch, bend words and hop from one cadence to another. After he playfully cuts the ""Usher tension,"" he and his stacked band and backup singers close with the powerful and spiritual ""Kody Blu 31.""

7io8CSHjN2E,Randall Goosby: Tiny Desk Concert,"Tom Huizenga | September 6, 2022
Violinist Randall Goosby has arrived – and not just at the Tiny Desk. The young Juilliard graduate is racking up debuts with the world's most important orchestras, he just pocketed the $25,000 Avery Fisher Career Grant and he can boast none other than violin legend Itzhak Perlman as his mentor. Not bad for 26 years old.

We know Goosby's star is on the rise, but the way his career got off the ground is worth mentioning. Goosby is an alum of the Detroit-based Sphinx Organization, which, for 25 years, has helped launch many prominent musicians of color, including composers Jessie Montgomery and Carlos Simon, pianist Lara Downes and opera stars Davóne Tines and Will Liverman. Goosby, at age 13, was the youngest to win the Sphinx Concerto Competition.

Sphinx was also where he first performed neglected music by Black composers. ""With each passing day,"" Goosby told NPR last year, ""you can almost see this wave of reckoning, and people starting to realize the magnitude of the body of work that we've not paid attention to.""

Joined by the discerning pianist Zhu Wang, Goosby begins with the Black British composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor's ""Deep River,"" the bittersweet spiritual whose melody floats with uncommon beauty in this performance. Listen for the perfectly placed high note at the end. Goosby then tips his hat to Antonin Dvorak, the composer who suggested that American composers look to the music of African Americans for pure inspiration. The two young musicians close with ""Estrellita,"" a bon-bon of unrequited love from Mexican composer Manuel Ponce.

With his secure technique, natural phrasing, gorgeous tone and smart programming, Randall Goosby has everything it takes to craft a major career.

McpF_s2wXcY,Juilliard Jazz Ensemble: Tiny Desk Concert,"Nikki Birch | Sept. 2, 2022
Jazz may not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think of The Juilliard School, but perhaps this series of Tiny Desks will change that. Tiny Desk and Jazz Night in America celebrate the 20th anniversary of Juilliard Jazz with three Tiny Desk concerts featuring performances by current students and alumni of the prestigious institution.

When the starry-eyed students of the Juilliard Jazz Ensemble first saw the Tiny Desk, they stopped short, exuding awe and wonderment. After all, several of their favorite artists had performed in this very space — and now here they were, ready to prove themselves and carry on the legacy of both the Tiny Desk and jazz.

The Juilliard Jazz Ensemble performed at the Tiny Desk in celebration of the jazz studies program's 20th anniversary. Made up of current students, the ensemble embodies the spirit of community and collaboration that is an essential part of the students' learning experience.

The ensemble opens with ""June"" a hypnotic composition by alto saxophonist Coby Petricone-Berg. We understand immediately despite the members' relative youth, this ensemble is not to be trifled with. A shout-out to the rhythm section is absolutely necessary, as drummer John Sturino, bassist Nico Martinez and pianist Esteban Castro lay back in the cut while ensuring the path ahead for the horns, with Jasim Perales giving us soulful trombone, is smooth like whipped shea butter. This is grade-A musicianship — everyone listening and unselfishly supporting each other.

For the final selection, Ekep Nkwelle presents her arrangement of Geri Allen's ""Timeless Portraits and Dreams."" Her voice soars in this contemplative ballad, a perfect closer that allows each member of the ensemble to shine as they share the hope that, ""In tomorrow's world, let joy and love run free / Let's hold on to our dreams.""

vkzlU2fDLs8,SIX The Musical: Tiny Desk Concert,"Josh Rogosin | Sept. 1, 2022
As soon as the Queens saw the Tiny Desk, their excitement was palpable. After the initial flurry of selfies were snapped, the actors and band completely owned the room — enrapturing the audience of NPR staffers assembled.

SIX The Musical imagines the six wives of Henry VIII reuniting on stage as real-life popstars. Their ""queenspirations"" include Beyoncé (for Catherine of Aragon, as played by Khaila Wilcoxon), Miley Cyrus (Anne Boleyn played by Storm Lever), Adele (Jane Seymour played by Jasmine Forsberg), Lizzo (Anna of Cleves played by Olivia Donalson), Britney Spears (Katherine Howard played by Didi Romero) and Celine Dion (Catherine Parr played by Gabriela Carrillo).

SIX premiered in 2017 at the famed Edinburgh Fringe Festival and was written by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss while students at the University of Cambridge. Since then, the show has become a global sensation — with six productions running concurrently. It won this year's Tony Awards for best original score and best costume design of a musical.

Opening night on Broadway was set for March 12, 2020. Just 90 minutes before curtain, New York theaters were ordered to close due to the pandemic. As the resident theater geek on the team, I pitched SIX for a Tiny Desk (home) concert once the show finally opened in the fall of 2021. Then it was announced that the musical would be at The National Theatre just a few miles from NPR HQ. Luckily, we were all finally back at Bob's diminutive desk recording bands, ready to welcome them. The rest, as they say, is herstory.

Tiny Desk and Jazz Night in America celebrate the 20th anniversary of Juilliard Jazz with three Tiny Desk concerts featuring performances by current students and alumni of the prestigious institution.

Nikki Birch | August 31, 2022
Before Isaiah J. Thompson walked into NPR's office, special preparations for his Tiny Desk concert were already underway: the arrival and tuning of a piano for the Steinway artist, who performed the final concert in our Juilliard Jazz 20th anniversary series. When the soft-spoken pianist and his sharply-dressed bandmates touched down, I knew we were in for a treat.

A common thread throughout the group's musical selections is a commitment to honoring the fibers that make up the rich fabric of African American culture. Thompson's first composition, ""Maestros of the Community,"" is an uptempo dedication to the indelible impact of seeing his identity reflected and amplified by unsunned mentors. The following song, ""Thank You Betsy,"" is a warm, dreamy ballad that highlights tenor saxophonist Julian Lee (previously featured on Jazz Night) and bassist Felix Moseholm.

The quartet's chemistry is undeniable, its long history of playing together evident in the way the members read each other's quick glances and their ability to pivot and improvise, unphased, when the unexpected occurs. (Blink and you might miss drummer Kyle Poole swiftly picking up a brush when his stick slips from his grasp.) The set ends with ""The Highest Calling,"" a fast-paced toe-tapper which gives each musician a chance to stretch. The quartet's sound, channeled through Thompson's compositions, becomes an elegant statement that combines jazz's past and present to paint a beautiful portrait of its future.

KD3vTmbIZdU,Endea Owens and The Cookout: Tiny Desk Concert,"Jazz may not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think of The Juilliard School, but perhaps this series of Tiny Desks will change that. Tiny Desk and Jazz Night in America celebrate the 20th anniversary of Juilliard Jazz with three Tiny Desk concerts featuring performances by current students and alumni of the prestigious institution.

Nikki Birch | August 29, 2022
Clad in a fringed, royal blue halter suit, bassist Endea Owens and her band The Cookout were all smiles. Although she’s no stranger to the Tiny Desk (playing with Jon Batiste in 2020) Owens was giddy with excitement to perform her own music with fellow Juilliard alumni. She spoke about the importance of using her music to speak for the voiceless, and to build and enrich communities. She’s not all talk either — during the COVID-19 pandemic, the house bassist for The Late Show with Stephen Colbert has hosted community cookouts, playing music for people in Harlem and handing out hundreds of free meals. 

The first tune “Where the Nubians Grow” is a head-bobbing groove dedicated to her hometown of Detroit. With “Feel Good,” her fierce intro gives way to a catchy bass line that the band joyfully hopscotches over. Owens then dims the proverbial lights with “Love Cynical” a song that gives ballroom jazz with silky horn lines and a sensuous beat. Before we can get too cozy, the band erupts into “Cycles,” a dizzying showcase for horns and drums.

To close her shows, Owens always asks audiences to participate in affirmations allowing a continuation of the positive vibes. After a brief introduction of “Lift Every Voice and Sing” the band plays “For the People (In dedication to Taleshia Chandler),” another uplifting number. This Tiny Desk energized the whole room, each musician a master of their instrument. Owens joked: “We are all Juilliard alumni, so you can hear it in the sound.”

sdaOtnuw-Ew,ADG7: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | August 19, 2022
How do you fit a gayageum and an ajaeng behind the Tiny Desk? That’s the question I whispered into the ear of our Tiny Desk audio engineer, Josh Rogosin, when we first saw ADG7 playing those five-foot long string instruments at globalFEST in New York City at the top of 2020. The Tiny Desk team solved the puzzle and the nine-piece Korean band filled the room with joy and a sound that’s unique in Tiny Desk history. ADG7 mixes traditional, shamanistic ritual sounds with Korean folk songs from Hwanghae Province. The group’s full name is Ak Dan Gwang Chil: “Ak Dan” translates as band, while “Gwang Chil” is in honor of the band having formed during the 70th anniversary of Gwangbokjeol, the National Liberation Day of Korea. The music is from the band’s 2020 album, Such is Life, and its self-titled 2017 album.

The three singers, Hong Ok, Myeong Wol and Yoo Wol, immediately capture my eyes and ears but my attention begins to sway toward Lee Man Wol, who appears to be blowing into a pipe organ she holds in her hands. The instrument is a saenghwang, just one of ADG7’s transfixing instruments — including brilliant percussion and a large bamboo flute known as a daegeum played by bandleader Kim Yak Dae — that make this enthusiastic and adventurous concert an eye-opener.

WVfbIWC7wmE,Andrew Bird and Iron & Wine: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | August 12, 2022
I'd been entertained and enchanted by the many of the 150 or so small concerts Andrew Bird performed on Instagram during the pandemic. Then I heard his new album, Inside Problems, and invited him to the desk. It had been six years since his first Tiny Desk performance, which was with a band; this time, I wanted an intimate solo performance. He and Iron & Wine's Sam Beam were becoming friends and touring together, and Andrew's idea was to have Sam perform on the final tune. But as they played together night after night on tour, that one song turned into four, and an Andrew Bird and Iron & Wine Tiny Desk was born.

Sam Beam is no stranger to the desk either. His first concert was a solo show in 2011, when the series was just a few years old. He returned with Calexico in 2019.

The two of them together are playful, poking fun at one another. ""We started learning each other's songs,"" Andrew says, ""I love Sam's writing"" — to which Sam retorts, ""I love your handwriting."" The silly smiles launch them into the Iron & Wine song ""Flightless Bird, American Mouth"" from 2007.

An absolute favorite moment is when they perform Andrew Bird's ""Left Handed Kisses,"" performed originally as a duet with Fiona Apple and remade here with serious fun by our dynamic duo.

This concert occurred near the end of a nearly 30-city tour postponed by COVID. The two met in the waters of Yosemite in 2021, and I wouldn't be surprised to see more from this musical friendship in the years to come.

ANPbOxaRIO0,DOMi & JD BECK: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | August 10, 2022
If you've heard a DOMi & JD BECK song or watched a performance online, expectations of catching brilliance when you witness the jazz duo in person are likely high. JD's drumsticks move faster than the brain can process. DOMi offers every appendage on her body to the keys. It's frantic but focused, and I can't stop watching. For as tight as the two artists are musically — and even physically; one of their few Tiny Desk requests was for the drums and keys to be set up as close as possible — they take silly self-deprecating jabs when they aren't playing. It's believable until they transform and the music starts.

The two musicians come from two completely different parts of the world. James Beck began cutting his teeth as young as eleven at jam sessions in Dallas. DOMi, aka DOMi Louna, was born in France and raised on jazz, and enrolled at the Conservatoire Régional du Grand Nancy at five. DOMi eventually made her way to the States via a Presidential Scholarship from the Berklee College of Music. The two met at a trade show in 2018 and have been inseparable since, playing sets on YouTube and driving the internet nuts. Before they knew it, they were rubbing elbows with the upper echelon in jazz, R&B, and hip-hop.

The duo's debut album, ironically titled NOT TiGHT, is a graduation of sorts with all of their OGs lending a hand — notably Anderson .Paak, who took DOMi and JD BECK under his wing and made the duo the first signee to his APES*** label. The two brought highlights from that album to the Tiny Desk, including the vines, turf and vibrant floral arrangements from the album cover. Before ""U DON'T HAVE TO ROB ME,"" a true story turned comedy, they make another attempt at neutralizing the room. DOMi says, ""We're gonna ruin it!"" It's too late for all of that. We're already amazed.

Eq5inG547JA,Regina Spektor: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | August 5, 2022
Regina Spektor sat in her hotel room waiting as we tuned the piano behind my desk. In those idle moments, she whipped up a ""Tiny Song,"" and she opens her concert singing this sweet, funny and tiny ditty. ""Took a train from New York to D.C. / And everyone was coughing on me,"" she sings, ""But I wore a real tight mask / And got myself a negative COVID test."" I won't spoil the rest except to say that what unfolds over the course of the next five songs is the humor and passions I've loved in Regina Spektor's music since receiving an early release of her Soviet Kitsch CD in 2004.

Now 18 years later, Regina has made what I believe is her most astonishing record to date, Home, before and after. We hear two songs from this 2022 release, including the album's opening track, ""Becoming All Alone."" The story has Regina walking home alone when she hears God call out her name: ""And He said, 'Hey, Let's grab a beer / It's awful late / We both right here,' "" she sings, ""And we didn't even have to pay / 'Cause God is God / And He's revered."" Their conversation ensues, and Spektor wonders just why life and loneliness don't improve with time. It's the type of truth and whimsy that makes for such heartbreaking music, including old favorites ""Fidelity"" and ""Samson,"" performed here simply on piano with charm and conviction.

3944VpVVKCI,Madison Cunningham: Tiny Desk Concert,"Jewly Hight | August 3, 2022
Madison Cunningham looked thoroughly put together behind the Tiny Desk in her white satin pantsuit and powder blue blouse, but her performance didn't seem at all buttoned-up. The clear leader of her band of crack, Southern California musicians — keyboardist Philip Krohnengold, bassist Daniel Rhine and drummer Kyle Crane — she was also our audacious guide, steering us toward exploration with the shrewd parts she played on three different guitars over the course of four songs.

A West Coast native herself, she's learned well the liberating lessons of Joni Mitchell and much more recent predecessors like Fiona Apple, Andrew Bird and Chris Thile, who welcomed her into a scene that celebrates the splintering of familiar folk, indie rock and singer-songwriter song forms.

The songs that Cunningham selected for her Tiny Desk, culled from her third album, Revealer — out in early September — are alive with new sensations. She opens with ""All I've Ever Known,"" and makes the confession of an artist only getting started, but powerfully awake to possibility: ""I'm afraid of what I don't know."" ""Hospital,"" a song whose wiry, tunefully loopy vocal lines and guitar licks stayed lodged in my head for days, transforms a setting that's become a symbol of doom into somewhere that she could face her own overstimulated extremes.

The other musicians left Cunningham alone behind the desk to conclude with her quietly riveting song ""Life According To Raechel,"" written after her grandmother passed, she tells us. Eyes closed, Cunningham took in the loss like she knew it would be the first of many.

3Wp99TlXu8U,Pigeon Pit: Tiny Desk Concert,"Lars Gotrich | July 28, 2022
A song by Pigeon Pit has gotten me through this year. Chugging a punk twang with the sun at its back, ""milk crates"" recognizes the relentless churn of life, but still seeks freedom from tyranny, exhaustion and the everyday nonsense that drags us down. The first time I heard the song performed live was at the band’s Tiny Desk sound check, and I gave into the cathartic release with a few tears, mouthing along to the throng of gang vocals: 

No job, no place to get away from
I've been to a world worth living in
No rent, no lies to memorize
No f***** up world to drown out

Lomes Oleander's voice is shaky, but damn sure of what she's singing. She began Pigeon Pit as a solo project in Olympia, Wash., frenetically bashing on an acoustic guitar with stories fit for summer nights lit by fireflies and cigarette glow. Older songs paint portraits of someone figuring out her mess in a messy world, and trying her damndest to be kind to herself while doing so. At the Tiny Desk, Oleander explained one such song, “wichitalk,” as ""a song for the girl I never let myself be when I was a kid."" 

Pigeon Pit's been touring basements and baseball fields around the country with a full band, filling out the ramshackle edges of its sound with fiddle, banjo, pedal steel, bass and drums. Fans show up with homemade patches that bear Oleander's shout-alongable punk poetry, which describes everything from shared quiet moments (""empties"") and swimming with friends (""river song"") to sassin' cops (""soup for my family""). At the Tiny Desk, the folk-punk unit plays these songs from feather river canyon blues, an album released on the first day of 2022, offering some sweetness in a world that doesn't always share the same in return.

va8ZaKj27Xk,Mivos Quartet: Tiny Desk Concert,"Tom Huizenga | July 19, 2022
As the members of the Mivos Quartet began their sound check behind Bob Boilen's desk, I couldn't help but think of old violins — which need to be played regularly in order to keep sounding good. For me, that's what our Tiny Desk space is like; it needs to cradle musicians and their music. After almost 1000 performances here, the pandemic shuttered our doors and this Mivos concert marks just the second time since March 2020 that music has rung out from this space. Hearing it was enough to make me tear up.

Of course, it helps to have extraordinary music, especially performed by these fine players who are devoted to contemporary music. They begin with ""Midnight Sun,"" a short movement from Robert Honstein's Arctic, written for Mivos in 2013. Its shimmering bright light and pulsating energy is inspired by photos taken above the Alaskan Arctic Circle in summer, when the sun never sets.

Henry Threadgill's Sixfivetwo, from 2018, is something altogether different. You won't go away humming the music, but that's not the point. An open mind is what the composer is looking for. The textures here are translucent and colorful, with room for individual solos and duets – some are improvised, others are written out. ""We get to where we are because of exploration,"" Threadgill once said. ""That's why improvisation is so important.""

The string quartet might be a 400-year-old recipe for music, but the Mivos Quartet proves that two violins, a viola and a cello are still a vibrant force, and a satisfying way to break in a unique space, relishing its music once again.

2oyZ9OM-neM,Ludovico Einaudi: Tiny Desk Concert,"Kara Frame | July 15, 2022
Ludovico Einaudi was on a North American tour, playing before audiences in the thousands, when he stopped by the NPR office to play a far more intimate setting: a Tiny Desk set. It’s the first tour for the Italian pianist and composer since the beginning of the pandemic, following the release of his 2022 album, Underwater. It’s an album that captures how many have felt in the pandemic — feeling underwater, or trapped in another world. 

It’s that relatable feeling — like we’re treading water trying to remain above the surface, powering through the adversity of the last two years — that makes Einaudi’s music so emotional and reflective. The pulsating strings of the opening song to his Tiny Desk concert, the track “Experience” from his 2013 album In A Time Lapse, demand attention, captivating the audience. The fact that the song recently went viral due to a TikTok trend only proves how welcoming Einaudi’s music is — and why he is the most-streamed classical pianist of all time.

Ludovico Einaudi’s presence at the piano keeps you waiting for more. His fingers glide over the keys effortlessly, but he never seems rushed. As he plays, his eyes are closed. And in this concert, you can tell his music moves him as much as it does his audience.

NWEqYj3OOoo,Belle and Sebastian: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | July 8, 2022
Now that we're back filming Tiny Desk concerts behind my desk at NPR, I get to witness that nervous energy surrounding most artists who are about to perform in an office, in daylight, with fans just a few feet away. This was surely true of the eight members of Belle and Sebastian when they kicked off their warmup with ""Unnecessary Drama."" That's the title of a track from the band's fabulous new album A Bit of Previous and not my description of what was about to unfold. Though I can't deny the tension.

You see, we don't amplify the singer's voice in the room, and we don't use monitor speakers. It all adds to the intimacy of the performance, but it also made it hard for Stuart Murdoch to hear himself sing. In fact, he began to question whether having an ensemble of drums, keyboards, guitars, bass, etc. was right for the Tiny Desk and considered scrapping it all in favor of him and a guitar and maybe another player. But with a little work on the overall volume of the band, some run-throughs and the creature comfort of a handheld microphone, the band from Glasgow was charming and magnificent.

Belle and Sebastian performed three songs from A Bit of Previous, its ninth album excluding two soundtracks. The band ended its delightful set with its classic tune ""Judy and the Dream of Horses"" from If You're Feeling Sinister, an album that's just celebrated its 25th anniversary. With questioning lyrics and youthful imagery, a guest trumpeter and a gallop in the rhythm, Belle and Sebastian gloriously made its dramatic mark at the Tiny Desk.

D3XZg82Z52A,Essential Voices USA: Tiny Desk Concert,"Tom Huizenga | July 1, 2022
With all the crazy politics and a stubborn pandemic dragging on, it’s easy to be pessimistic about America this Fourth of July. But this Tiny Desk performance — happily back in our NPR Music office — will help turn dark skies to blue and remind us of the best and brightest version of our country. 
 
This video marks the world premiere performance of excerpts of Washington Women, uplifting songs built on speeches and writings by amazing women — First Ladies, Secretaries of State, Senators and Supreme Court Justices — who had strong visions of what America should be.
 
The project is the brainchild of intrepid choral conductor and composer Judith Clurman, who directs the meticulously fine-tuned Essential Voices USA, a New York-based choir. While the songs have their own musical personalities, they also contain iconic political personalities. Hillary Rodham Clinton states, “Human rights are women’s rights, and women’s rights are human rights once and for all,” while Shirley Chisholm, the first Black congresswoman, declares that laws can be used to compel “the insensitive majority to reexamine its unconscious attitudes.” Betty Ford speaks of “the search for human freedom,” and Vice President Kamala Harris talks about the importance of dreaming big.
 
Clurman says she wrote the piece (along with Broadway arranger David Chase) not just for professional choruses to sing. She hopes that high school choirs will pick it up as well so that young people across the country will know how influential these women were and are, in making America a brighter, better place.

“The Essence of America” (text by Condoleezza Rice)

up8ODGFWgFg,Usher: Tiny Desk Concert,"This year, NPR Music is celebrating Black Music Month with an array of brand new Tiny Desk concerts — both from home and from behind our beloved Desk. Together, these artists represent the past, present and future of Black music. This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk's unique way of showcasing that talent.

Bobby Carter | June 30, 2022
""We celebrate Black Music Month. This has been Black magic."" Truer words may have never been spoken behind the Tiny Desk as R&B goliath Usher caps off our month-long celebration of Black music, highlighting a catalog chock-full of hits spanning 25 years. It's been over two years since NPR headquarters was abuzz with chatter of a legend in the building. After an early morning rehearsal for his set at the Something in the Water Festival in Washington, D.C., he made his way over to deliver an unforgettable performance.

Usher and his band, all dipped in black, set it off with an introduction over a funky horn-laced instrumental reminiscent of a Blaxploitation flick. They keep that groove going right into a reworked version of his 1997 breakout single, ""You Make Me Wanna..."" Twenty-five years later, Usher sits arguably as the king of R&B. Between 2000 and 2010, there was no debate whatsoever, with his string of records that included the biggest R&B album of the 21st century, Confessions.

What he's done in the vocal booth is only half of his claim to fame. The stage is where he's continued to shine as he prepares for the second leg of his Las Vegas residency. This loose and playful set touches on his many career phases; the crooning, the deeply personal, the club bangers and even the Tik Tok challenges indicate that he could just be reaching his prime. Recently, we've heard plenty of hot takes, wild battles and social media fodder about who sits at the mountaintop in the world of R&B. Usher Raymond has entered the chat.

glHqWvkpRqo,Denzel Curry: Tiny Desk Concert,"This year, NPR Music is celebrating Black Music Month with an array of brand new Tiny Desk concerts — both from home and from behind our beloved Desk. Together, these artists represent the past, present and future of Black music. This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk's unique way of showcasing that talent.

Ashley Pointer | June 29, 2022
After taking a sip of his tea towards the end of his six-song set, Denzel Curry turns to his band and exclaims: “We lowkey breezed through this b****! That’s great for two rehearsals!” 

From the moment Curry and his people stepped foot into NPR headquarters to record their Tiny Desk concert, the vibes were right. With a 10-piece configuration — consisting of drums, bass, keys, guitar, horns and percussion — the rapper put on a flawless and inspired live performance of songs off his latest LP as well as some of his biggest hits, all freshly arranged for the Tiny Desk.  

Over the course of a decade, Curry has released a number of albums and EPs, becoming one of the most versatile emcees in hip-hop today. His sixth studio album, Melt My Eyez See Your Future, marked a new artistic beginning for him: infusing neo-soul, jazz and traditional hip-hop influences into the album, with less “rah” and more mature introspection. Throughout this concert, you get a little bit of both. 

Curry and the Cold-Blooded Soul Band open their set with “Melt Session #1,” a feel-good neo-soul groove where Curry’s introspective lyrics flow beautifully, taking center stage. Then kicking it up a notch, Curry performs “Walkin” and “Troubles” with an assist from DJ POSHtronaut, employing some serious bounce complimented by catchy horn lines. In the second half of his set, Curry takes us back with “DIET_.” Evoking instant head-bops as bass and drums smoothly lock in, Curry charms our audience with his improvised rhymes and exuberant personality.  

As Curry and the band closed out the concert going absolutely bonkers with “RICKY,”  I could feel how light the room had gotten as everyone in the audience fed off Curry’s infectious energy fueled by distorted guitar and bass and punchy horns. “You know I killed that s***. You know I murked that s***!” Yes, Denzel Curry. Yes you did.

Suraya Mohamed | June 23, 2022
Almost 30 musicians, choir members and staff of the contemporary worship music collective Maverick City Music entered the NPR lobby and crowded the security desk to undergo COVID protocols. Even through the dull process of checking vaccination cards and test results, there was a real feeling of excitement for what was about to happen.

Some of the choir members were eager not only for the upcoming Tiny Desk concert but for later that evening, when they were scheduled to perform at a sold-out 20,000-seat arena nearby. A few of them had only previously performed with Maverick City Music in small venues and couldn't wait to move from the Tiny Desk to a big stage. Once upstairs, the group's enthusiasm grew during the set up and sound check. Even the NPR production staff was buzzing because we had not recorded such a large ensemble in our office in more than two years.

Once the performance started, Maverick City Music did what it always does. The members of the group became one voice, sharing beautiful music and spreading the good word with messages of hope, change and love. The group describes itself as a megaphone for a community of creatives that has been pushed to the margins of the industry of church music. Even for those who aren't fans of gospel music or for those who don't believe, it is possible to still find appreciation in this music's comforting and uplifting sound.

Most of the songs performed here are from the collective's new album, Kingdom Book One, which was produced in collaboration with gospel legend Kirk Franklin. It was a blessing to watch him perform here alongside talented vocalists Naomi Raine and Chandler Moore on the last song, ""Kingdom.""

Together, these artists represent the past, present and future of Black music. This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk's unique way of showcasing that talent.

Ashley Pointer | June 22, 2022
Hearing Ravyn Lenae’s voice resonate from behind the Tiny Desk for one of our first concerts back in the building had me entranced. With her voice raw and unamplified, Lenae and her dynamic band transformed our office into a funky, futuristic space where she was completely in her element. 

Hailing from Chicago, Lenae dropped her first EP, Moon Shoes, in 2015. Since then, she’s released two more EPs, her sound permeating the world of contemporary R&B and blurring the lines between soul, funk and R&B. This year Lenae reemerged with the release of her debut full length, HYPNOS, already shaping up to be one of the best albums of 2022. 

Her Tiny Desk concert commences with three songs off HYPNOS. Opening with “Venom,” an electro-funk song that seethes, Lenae sings: “Why do you play me for a fool?” Her signature falsetto descends over spacey synth melodies while her drummer keeps an insistent, metallicy groove. Then Lenae performs perhaps the most vulnerable songs from her new album, including “Skin Tight,” a melancholic guitar-led ballad that addresses a past romantic relationship and the energy that was once shared, and “Inside Out,” a love letter to herself that channels a ’90s R&B sound with dramatic piano harmonies, a soulful lead melody and dynamic drums. 

“I think it’s a lifelong journey, learning to love yourself and trust yourself, and believe in the skin you’re in,” Lenae says of “Inside Out.” “I wrote this song when I wasn’t so sure… that’s why we sing it together.” With a fiercely energetic upsweep, she closes the show with her hit “Sticky.” As she slides into those distinct shrilling oohs, I can’t help but sing along to her catchy hook — all while realizing that only Lenae can do it quite like that.

sN58k8tSFXg,"Alisa Amador, 2022 Tiny Desk Contest Winner: Tiny Desk Concert","Bob Boilen | May 31, 2022
It surely was a day of joyful tears. And those joyful tears for Alisa Amador, the winner of the 2022 Tiny Desk Contest, came at a time when she had been considering putting her music career on hold. For the staff of NPR and the Tiny Desk crew, it was our first Tiny Desk concert with an audience in over 800 days, and Alisa’s captivating music surely intensified our spinning emotions.

Alisa Amador opened with her Contest-winning entry “Milonga accidental,” a song about embracing your contradictions. It’s a song that our judges — iLe, Big Krit, Michelle Zauner (of Japanese Breakfast), Raveena, Nate Chinen (of member station WBGO), Tiny Desk producer Bobby Carter and I — all found to be so filled with passion. I often fall for a song because of the lyrics, and this is the first Tiny Desk Contest winner whose winning song is in Spanish. Despite the fact that I don’t speak Spanish, I felt the conflict, the yearning and the song's questioning. 

Alisa grew up in Boston, Maine, Puerto Rico and Argentina, and was raised by Rosi and Brian Amador, her Latin-folk musician parents who play in the band Sol y Canto; they were also in attendance. She’s been singing since she was four, and has been entering the Tiny Desk Contest every year since 2018. In fact, the song “Together,” which closes this concert, was an astonishing entry from 2020. For COVID safety, we limited the audience to a small group of masked NPR employees, yet the sing-along for the closing track was still powerful. 

Alisa also set her winning song to a lovely string arrangement performed by a Washington D.C. quartet and rehearsed for the first time just hours before the performance. The arrangements were originally done by Jamie Oshima after a recording session a few years back, and then Alisa’s friend Noah Fishman transcribed the arrangement. For the next three songs, she’s joined by Jamie Oshima (guitar, keys), Noah Harrington (bass) and Jacob Thompson (drums, keys).
 
“When will I know how to decipher my purpose? / When will I feel at home in my voice?” As Alisa sings those words to her winning entry in Spanish at the Tiny Desk, I’m thinking: Perhaps that moment is now.

l-JEdcOGuzQ,"Neffy, 2021 Tiny Desk Contest Winner: Tiny Desk Concert","Bob Boilen | October 27, 2021
It felt good to be home, if only for one night: home, in this case, being my Tiny Desk at NPR. We were about to film Neffy, our 2021 Tiny Desk Contest winner, at my desk at NPR headquarters. My corner of the NPR Music department looked just as I had left it almost 600 days ago; it's eerie inside and nearly nightfall outside. There's no audience for this Sunday evening concert, just our five-person Tiny Desk crew.

We had filmed almost 1,000 Tiny Desk concerts before we abandoned the office in mid-March of 2020. What was then exciting yet routine now felt somewhat like a hallucination.

For Neffy, it too was a dream: — a dream come true. Her joy during the recording was contagious. Neffy is Mecca Russell, a young singer who grew up around Arlington, Va., just across the river from NPR. Her Contest-winning song ""Wait Up"" is about living in New York, most recently during the COVID-19 outbreak, but yearning for home. In fact, Neffy did return to her childhood home, where she recorded her winning song with just her heartfelt voice and her guitar.

""I wrote 'Wait Up' like many other songs I've written: sitting on the edge of my bed. But I didn't know it would be the song that would change my life,"" Neffy told us. ""I got to sing lyrics I wrote in the privacy of my room late at night to a vast and loving audience is beyond my wildest dreams. For that, I am incredibly grateful, and quite frankly, still in disbelief.""

We hear three more songs from Neffy during her Tiny Desk concert. It's a small window into an outstanding talent, and we're so proud to share this extraordinary moment.

Otis Hart | July 15, 2013
It's not often that someone on the NPR Music team gets to see his or her favorite band perform a Tiny Desk Concert. After all, you can only have one favorite band, and NPR Music supports a staff of about 20; that means that, of the 250-plus Tiny Desk Concerts we've produced, fewer than 10 percent could possibly have qualified for favorite-band status.

All of which is to say that my favorite band, Yo La Tengo, actually played a Tiny Desk Concert. For those who aren't familiar with the Hoboken trio, Yo La Tengo's members — guitarist Ira Kaplan, drummer Georgia Hubley and bassist James McNew — have been doing their own thing (which, granted, can sometimes sound like The Velvet Underground) for more than 20 years. The band epitomizes, sheepishly, why so many were drawn to indie rock in the 1990s: the casual resolve to be yourself and let everything else sort itself out.

The Yo La Tengo sound has evolved quite a bit since Hubley and Kaplan first jammed together in 1984; the feedback has subsided as they've grown older, replaced by a more contemplative vibe. The release of the band's 13th album, Fade, earlier this year marked a natural time to invite Yo La Tengo behind Bob Boilen's desk for an acoustic set.

Felix Contreras | April 12, 2012

Something about tradition inspires reverence and creativity. Throughout Latin America and parts of the U.S., musicians are exhuming centuries-old musical cultures and infusing them with new life to create songs that sound both familiar and new. Peru's Novalima is doing just that with Afro-Peruvian music.

Over the course of three superb albums, the group has addressed the legacy of slavery in Peru in the form of the traditional lando, a dance rhythm with roots in West Africa. The slow, deliberate beats are played out on a variety of traditional instruments — most notably the cajon, a big rectangular box that drummers hit before drawing sounds out with their palms and fingers. The result can be as deep as a bass drum, but can also hit the high-pitched pops of finely tuned bongos or Middle Eastern dumbeks.

Novalima also adds electronic sounds to those beats and arrangements. Initially, the group's core members crafted their songs by trading files over the Internet, layering their own ideas over traditional rhythms. It's now a full-time working band, and while the electronica persists, it's not layered over samples, but over the work of two talented percussionists. In fact, the playing zigzags between Afro-Peruvian grooves and more familiar Afro-Cuban rhythms associated with salsa.

For this Tiny Desk Concert at the NPR Music offices, Novalima played in a lean, mean, funky configuration. The beats are pounded out by hand — not with sticks — and the singing recalls tradition while feeling here and now. Before too long, Novalima had the room grooving, and made many of us reluctant to get back to our cubicles.

Grouplove knows how to write the kind of songs that keep me awake at night, that sing in my head over and over, that have me pounding the steering wheel to the beat, and that are worth rolling down the car windows and sharing with pedestrians whether they want to hear them or not. These aren't the greatest singers or guitarists we've had play in the NPR Music offices — the early-day warmup for the three songs here seemed about the length of a full concert — that craft will strengthen as they play. Grouplove has been together for less than two years, but its knack for pop songwriting is priceless. You can hear it best on the band's debut album, Never Trust a Happy Song.

Singer Hannah Hooper and songwriter, singer and guitarist Christian Zucconi met the other members of Grouplove — Sean Gadd, Ryan Rabin and Andrew Wessen — far from their homes at an artists' retreat on the Isle of Crete. They vowed to work on music together and recorded an EP in the garage of drummer Rabin's parents; Rabin's dad is Trevor Rabin, guitarist for the prog-rock band Yes in the early '80s and '90s.

When it came time to work on Never Trust a Happy Song, Grouplove moved from the garage to Ryan Rabin's apartment, where he did his first major album production. The band is a collaborative unit, and though songs may start with Christian Zucconi, everyone chips in. Judging from the music, there's a lot of fun and sparks flying in those rehearsal sessions.

Grouplove's name is emblematic of its spirit; it's also emblazoned as a tattoo on many of the band members. So, honestly, how could they ever break up? In the meantime, I look forward to hearing Grouplove grow.

Patrick Jarenwattananon | July 7, 2011
You hear a lot about young prodigies in jazz. That's understandable: Jazz prizes skill, and any teenager who can tear it up like the big boys and girls is usually worth a smile and nod. But usually, you can safely make a note to yourself to check in about that kid in, say, 10 years. It's one thing to emulate the masters' technique. It's another to develop an original style, the way your heroes did.

Guitarist Julian Lage, 23, was once called a prodigy. He was a cute kid, true. But lately, he's also been playing in bands of master musicians — among them Gary Burton, Eric Harland and Mark O'Connor. There's also the matter of Lage's distinct sound. He plays an electric guitar, which sounds almost like an acoustic, and he tends toward folky, pastoral lines, but with a bite. When Lage released his debut album two years ago, even hardened jazz cynics took notice: He had ideas, too.

When Lage recently came for a one-nighter in Washington, D.C., he brought only bassist Jorge Roeder and percussionist Tupac Mantilla. (His usual quintet is a bit unusual, adding a saxophonist and a cellist.) Collectively, the three are soft-spoken and friendly, and they're stellar musicians, too. At the NPR Music offices, they treated us to songs that haven't yet been commercially recorded — the opening tune ""Welcoming Committee"" and the closing untitled number, harvested from a little online experiment wherein Lage challenged himself to write a song a day for 30 days. (""The first 23 suuucked,"" he joked.) In between, there's the gentle whisk and country-road twang of ""However,"" which appears on the Julian Lage Group's 2011 sophomore album, Gladwell.

The three looked intently at each other throughout this Tiny Desk Concert, with the sort of push-and-pull group interaction that brought a near-constant smile to each of their faces. There was plenty of concentration wrapped up in that, of course; before we started rolling tape, the three grabbed each other's hands in a circle for a brief moment of meditative clarity. But then they had some fun.

Stephen Thompson | July 5, 2011

The numbers alone bear out The Blind Boys of Alabama's status as one of the greatest and most venerated gospel groups the world has ever known. Formed under a different name in 1939, the band has understandably experienced many lineup changes in the 72 years since: Singer Jimmy Carter is the only participant in this lineup billed as a founding member, and even that term is up for debate. But there's no mistaking the tremendous legacy these men embody, from the 60-plus albums and Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award to the group's 2007 induction into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame.

That said, numbers and awards don't sum up the gentle, easygoing grace of this Tiny Desk Concert, wherein these Blind Boys — young and old, blind and sighted — craft an impeccable mix of polished blues, swinging soul and from-the-gut gospel. The Blind Boys of Alabama's new album, Take the High Road, features an assortment of country stars, from Jamey Johnson and Willie Nelson to Lee Ann Womack and Hank Williams Jr. That the group so seamlessly bridges the worlds of country, gospel, blues and R&B speaks volumes about its impact on performers of every stripe, not to mention the graceful ease with which its message can stick to just about any soul.

Bob Boilen | May 23, 2011

I simply couldn't believe my eyes and ears. Seeing Jackie Evancho sing for the first time is nearly beyond belief. You've seen 11-year-olds, and you've heard beyond-beautiful singers. But rarely are they the same person — that is, until now.

Evancho is an American singer of classical crossover material who performs show tunes, classical repertoire such as ""Ave Maria"" or Handel's ""Ombra mai fu"" or even a pop tune like Sarah McLachlan's ""Angel."" The world first heard her when she appeared on the reality show competition America's Got Talent, where she came in second place, yet wowed audiences with a powerful, mature voice that seemed nearly impossible to be coming out of such a tiny frame.

She was inspired to sing after watching The Phantom of the Opera, and by age 8, she started entering contests. She put out an independent album in 2009 and released a holiday CD for Columbia Records. But it's her new collection of songs called Dream With Me (out June 14) that will bring her into the spotlight. The album includes appearances from Barbra Streisand and fellow TV singing sensation Susan Boyle, and is sure to impress fans of both. That record includes ""Ombra mai fu,"" an aria Evancho performed at the Tiny Desk for a stunned audience at the NPR Music offices. She clearly is a very happy girl with an amazing musical gift. Enjoy.

Stephen Thompson | May 22, 2011

It's been fascinating to watch the evolution of the Duluth, Minn., band Low in the 17 years since the release of its wonderful debut album, I Could Live in Hope. Renowned for being one of the slowest and quietest acts in indie-rock, Low has nevertheless found ways to experiment with new ways to sound alternately (and even simultaneously) swoony and unnerving.

Still, in spite of its members' detours into more jagged terrain — 2007's prickly Drums and Guns, singer Alan Sparhawk's rock 'n' roll side project Retribution Gospel Choir — Low returns to sweet-voiced gentility on its recent C'mon. That album's opening track, ""Try to Sleep,"" opens this short set at the NPR Music offices, and damned if it isn't one of the best songs of the group's career; a perfect mixture of sunny charm and lyrical portent. (""Don't look at the camera,"" Sparhawk sings with wife and drummer Mimi Parker, adding, ""Try to sleep."")

With just Sparhawk, Parker and an acoustic guitar at its disposal — many bassists have come and gone over the years, and none made this trip — Low still kept its core ingredients intact at the Tiny Desk. Clearly awake earlier than usual for an 11 a.m. set time, the pair nevertheless blended the way they always do, with Parker's pristine voice hovering over Sparhawk's froggy croon. They seem worn and a little weary throughout these three songs from C'mon, but the beauty persists.

Frannie Kelley | May 16, 2011

Future Islands' members showed up with the biggest amplifier we've ever squeezed behind Bob Boilen's desk. Then, because they're such nice guys, they tried to keep it down. Tamping down the levels didn't dampen their intensity, though, and by the third song, the band and the crowd were struggling to keep it office-appropriate.

The band's goal, of course, was to make us break (it) down. ""I want you to cry,"" said Sam Herring, who sings and writes all the lyrics. ""I want you to feel the way I feel."" He said that, in songs like ""On the Water,"" he's using the fewest words possible to communicate most directly. Forget miscommunication, crossed signals, all that mess. ""I want to crush,"" he says.

In case that sounds kind of cruel, Herring reminded us that crying is a good thing. Therapists tell some people to do it more often. What Future Islands is really going for, with the mordant wit in the lyrics, the melodramatic chord progressions and Herring's yowling, scratchy voice, is catharsis. And catharsis can happen in your head and in your heart.

""Some people hear the music and they want to dance. They don't hear the words. And some people hear the words, but they don't understand the other side of it,"" Herring said. ""Those people come together and they share that space. They get the same thing out of it in the end, hopefully.""

Future Islands came to our office and played some sad songs. The band did the aforementioned weeper ""On the Water,"" as well as ""The Ink Well,"" a song about saying goodbye to someone. Then they commanded us to move: Just before launching into ""Walking Through That Door,"" a song about missing your hometown, Herring said, ""Y'all can dance if you want to.""

Stephen Thompson | January 24, 2011
A sweetly engaging folk-pop singer from Ontario, Basia Bulat first won me over with a brisk, charming single called ""In the Night,"" which finds her deploying an autoharp in lieu of the standard-issue guitar. When playing the song live, it looks as if Bulat is singing while burping a stringed infant. But when she turned up at the NPR Music offices last September, she'd brought everything except her autoharp: She came with her full band (Holly Coish on ukulele, Allison Stewart on viola, her brother Bobby Bulat on percussion and Ben Whiteley on bass), as well as her own guitar and a hammered, zither-like instrument called a pianoette.

On request, with the aid of an acoustic guitar, Bulat made a game run through ""In the Night"" to close this Tiny Desk Concert. But that marvelous ringer is far from the only highlight here: After opening with ""The Shore"" — performed on the aforementioned pianoette — Bulat salutes her Polish heritage by performing an old song called ""W Zielonym Zoo,"" which roughly translates as ""In the Green Zoo."" And, while the selection that follows (""Heart of My Own"") is considerably easier to follow, Bulat does plenty in these 15 minutes to showcase her considerable range. Along the way, she never loses an ounce of the good-natured charm that led us to invite her to the Tiny Desk in the first place.

Bob Boilen | November 17, 2010

The Ghost Of A Saber Tooth Tiger consists of two down-to-earth people with their heads in the clouds: Sean Lennon and Charlotte Kemp Muhl. Muhl is a model with a creative ear for music-making, while Lennon is the son of John and Yoko. Together, they write dreamy musings on everything from dark matter to the pedestrian and mundane.

The duo has recorded two albums: The first is called Acoustic Sessions, while the second will be electric. Acoustic Sessions was recorded in the bedroom and kitchen of the pair's New York City apartment, so it wasn't such a stretch for them to play in the cozy confines of the NPR Music offices. You can see their playful humor right from the start — and watch Lennon's mind wander as he looks out our fifth-floor windows.

The attraction for me lies in the whimsy of Muhl and Lennon's music, as well as the charm that oozes from their songs. This Tiny Desk concert offers a perfect introduction to their musical world.

Bob Boilen | November 1, 2010

Few musicians get better with age, but Nick Lowe is an exception. I've been following Lowe's music since his days with the country-rock band Brinsley Schwarz in the early 1970s. He wrote one of his best-known tunes with that band: ""(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding?"" But it wasn't until he left Brinsley Schwarz that people began hearing his name, first with the Dave Edmunds project Rockpile. (Edmunds produced one of the last Brinsley Schwarz records, the one with ""What's So Funny."")

But what put Nick Lowe on the map was his work with the innovative upstart label Stiff Records, as well as his efforts as a producer on that label for a young unknown named Elvis Costello. Lowe would produce the first five Costello records, and it was the latter's rendition of ""(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding?"" that made that song the pop classic it is.

For Lowe's fans, the solo records he'd make were a constant source of joy and wit. Songs such as ""I Love the Sound of Breaking Glass,"" ""Cruel to Be Kind"" (another tune written during the Brinsley Schwarz days), ""Little Hitler"" and ""Heart of the City"" were all part of a new breed of pop music that felt good without making listeners feel stupid. In other words, this is more than just catchy music.

Lowe has said that one of his biggest fears is growing old doing the same shtick he did as a handsome young lad. In 1998, he put out an album that set the stage for the gracefully aging Nick Lowe: Dig My Mood. To get a taste of that record, check out the first song in this Tiny Desk Concert; it's a song about a bitter old man titled ""Man That I've Become,"" and its words are vintage Lowe: ""His heart's a prune / when it once was a plum / If you know him / that's the kind of man that I've become.""

At 61, Nick Lowe is part crooner, part country and a little crotchety, but with a heart of pure pop. He's lost nothing, and for proof, don't miss ""House for Sale,"" a brand-new, not-yet-released song that's as affecting as anything Lowe has written.

Jasmine Garsd | September 13, 2010

Like many in America, the first time I heard Seu Jorge was through his role as a melancholy singer in the movie The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou. His rendition of David Bowie classics mesmerized me. The ache of his thick, raw vocals is nearly unbearable. Perhaps it's something about a burly grown man whose voice seems about to give in to tears that's simply heartbreaking. Or perhaps it was the shock of hearing Bowie's music, which in its original incarnation was pure glam rock, sung by a boy from one of Rio de Janeiro's worst slums.

In his newest project, with the company of his fantastic band Almaz, Seu Jorge is far more versatile, almost as if the band were encouraging him to go to that bar, hit that dance floor, flirt with that supermodel. But no matter how smooth he is, he's still that melancholy guy who played Bowie on Steve Zissou's ship (not to mention his heartbreaking turn in the film City of God, as a victim of a sociopathic druglord). Jorge's covers of classic Brazilian songs like ""Saudosa Bahia' — which is about wanting to go back home — find him at his best.

I've always been curious to find out what Seu Jorge sounds like live, and in this Tiny Desk Concert I finally got my answer: He sounds as powerful as he does on his records, if not better. And he loves to play live, feeding off the energy of the audience. Later, he mentioned to me — while on his fourth cigarette break; there's a reason behind this man's raspy voice — how much he enjoyed being able to play while sitting right next to audience members. Here's hoping he comes back soon.",2022-10-24 15:45:05,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ws_5-hiqao,NORMAL,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2Ws_5-hiqao/default.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2Ws_5-hiqao/mqdefault.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2Ws_5-hiqao/hqdefault.jpg,NPR Music,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A

If you look carefully over the shoulder of Lawrence Arabia's guitarist, you'll see the cover art to The Beatles' Abbey Road etched onto a coaster. And, though the coaster placement was random, it turned out to be apropos. After all, Lawrence Arabia, led by singer James Milne, crafts harmony parts that would have felt right at home in 1969.

Milne is from New Zealand, and his second album with Lawrence Arabia is titled Chant Darling. That record was recorded in three different countries: Milne started in Sweden by laying down drums and basic tracks at a friend's studio, and then more work was recorded in bedrooms and living rooms in London before the band returned to New Zealand for finishing touches from friends.

Lawrence Arabia's witty songs are good for more than just singing along: They provide a few chuckles, too. That comes through in the four tracks from Chant Darling that turn up in this Tiny Desk Concert at the NPR Music offices.

Ten years ago, I heard an astonishing voice stand out in a group filled with strong singers. The voice belonged to Frazey Ford; the group was The Be Good Tanyas.

The Be Good Tanyas released three outstanding albums — Blue Horse is still a favorite of mine — and then, silence. It's been four years since we've heard Ford's lilting, laid-back sound, but now she's back with a solo record. The album, Obadiah (which also features another Be Good Tanya, Trish Klein) follows Ford's love of rhythm and blues and traditional American country music.

Mavis Staples is a legend, but she's not stuck in the past. You probably know her work with her family band, The Staple Singers, which was all over the radio in the '70s with hits like ""Respect Yourself,"" ""Let's Do It Again"" and ""I'll Take You There"" (which she excerpts in her performance here).

What you may not know is that Mavis Staples has been actively working with her fellow Chicago musician (and Wilco leader) Jeff Tweedy on her upcoming album, You Are Not Alone. Tweedy produced the record and wrote a few songs for her, as well — including the title track, which she sings here.

The album was recorded at Wilco's studio, The Loft, and it includes songs by John Fogerty, Randy Newman, Rev. Gary Davis, Allen Toussaint and Pops Staples. You Are Not Alone also features a fine guest roster, including not only Tweedy (on bass, guitar and vocals), but also Nora O'Connor, Kelly Hogan and Wilco's Patrick Sansone on keys and vibes.

Rick Holmstrom, the skilled guitarist who accompanies Staples here, also plays on the record and in her touring band. And while You Are Not Alone doesn't come out until Sept. 14, you can get a good idea of what a treat it is by watching this stripped-down but soulful Tiny Desk concert.

""Beyond category."" That's what Duke Ellington used to call musicians who were simply the best at what they do. And that's certainly the case for Bela Fleck, Edgar Meyer and Zakir Hussain. Individually, they're world-class masters of the banjo, the bass fiddle and the tabla, respectively. They conquered mere technical prowess long ago.

All three now are at a place where music truly becomes so intuitive that a simple rehearsal — as we got to see before this Tiny Desk Concert in the offices of NPR Music — is an exercise in wordless communication. Just before we rolled tape, the trio worked on a section of one of the songs that involved some unison playing, and I was caught off guard, thinking they didn't really nail it when they tried it three times in a row. Then, when it came time to perform for an audience, they, of course, performed it flawlessly.

Ellington had no idea that his words would eventually be applied to a banjo player, a bass fiddle player and an South Asian percussionist. But sit back and enjoy these two pieces from The Melody of Rhythm, and you'll see how right Ellington was.

Watch Jimmy Cliff’s Tiny Desk concert from 2010: https://www.npr.org/2010/07/12/128383652/jimmy-cliff-tiny-desk-concert

Bob Boilen | July 12, 2010
Jimmy Cliff is a gentle soul — that's always come through in his songs and in the lilt in his voice. His most legendary songs appeared in the 1972 film The Harder They Come and its soundtrack; start with ""Many Rivers to Cross"" and you'll feel the heart, soul and wisdom of Jimmy Cliff.

Cliff starred in The Harder They Come as a reggae artist trying to make it in the music business, and the songs he sings — including ""You Can Get It If You Really Want,"" ""Sitting in Limbo"" (both of which he performs in this Tiny Desk Concert) and ""The Harder They Come"" — never died. They're part of the soundtrack to a generation, but their reach extends beyond that. The Harder They Come put reggae on the map in the early '70s and became both an antidote and a guiding spirit to the punk and new wave music that would come a few years later.

For a musician, it must be hard to have your career hinge on your early music, but Jimmy Cliff always soldiered on. Still does. And his new songs are often as good as those early ones — he performs one, ""I Got to Move On,"" here. But it is often circumstances, not songwriting abilities, that land a tune in the canon.

Jimmy Cliff was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame earlier this year — and was, for many, the star performer there. In myriad ways, his aging voice sounds better than ever, having grown into those songs he wrote and sang nearly four decades ago. I felt honored to be a part of this Tiny Desk Concert, and pleased that we captured it for posterity.",2022-10-24 15:41:23,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYtIT6J7G10,NORMAL,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QYtIT6J7G10/default.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QYtIT6J7G10/mqdefault.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QYtIT6J7G10/hqdefault.jpg,NPR Music,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A

Watch Gogol Bordello’s Tiny Desk concert from 2010: https://www.npr.org/2019/09/11/128111544/gogol-bordello-tiny-desk-concert

Stephen Thompson | June 28, 2010

If you watch this video and don't get to the part where Eugene Hutz is dancing on the desks, then you've missed the most rollicking and insane Tiny Desk Concert of all time.


I've seen Gogol Bordello at a nightclub, and its live show is a gypsy punk circus, complete with a high-wire act. So when the band arrived at the modest NPR Music offices, I wanted to make sure we were covered technically; I figured they'd move around and wind up singing far away from our microphones. I asked Sergey Ryabtsev — Gogol Bordello's Russian-born violinist — if he thought bandleader Eugene Hutz might wind up dancing on my desk. With a huge smile and a large shot glass of vodka in hand, he said, ""Don't worry about it!""


By the third song, Hutz was sitting with the NPR crew in an office chair, singing his ode to alcohol. By the fourth, he was jumping from desktop to desktop, singing and dancing.


Gogol Bordello is based in New York City, and has been performing its theatrical concoction of accordion, violin and guitar since the late '90s. The band writes songs about immigration and the celebration of cultural differences. Now, for 2010, Gogol Bordello has its fifth album out — its first on a major label. Producer Rick Rubin, known for his Johnny Cash production and for co-founding Def Jam Records, helped make Trans-Continental Hustle. It's an album with more range than sheer thrust, and though the band played a few songs from that album at the desk, when Gogol Bordello is in front of a crowd, it's in full-throttle mode. No complaints there.

June 22, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- Sudan Archives is a truly singular artist, inspired by Irish and African music, especially Sudanese music. The first time I saw her was in a crowd of people at Cheer Up Charlies during SXSW in March of 2018. The show was wild and wonderful: effects pedals transformed her violin into a full-on band, with electronic beats keeping it all moving.

Almost exactly two years later, things couldn't be more different. On March 6, SXSW 2020 was canceled due to COVID-19. By the time Sudan Archives arrived at NPR in Washington, D.C., on March 11, everyone was concerned about the coronavirus threat. So we sanitized the desk, the mics and the cameras. We also kept our distance.

She came not with an array of electronics, but with violinist Jessica McJunkins, violist Dominic Johnson and cellist Khari Joyner. The new arrangement at the top of ""Confessions"" was the perfect tension queller. And those arrangements also heighten the lyrics. Listening again three months later, three weeks into police brutality protests, the words — ""There is a place that I call home / But it's not where I am welcome / And if I saw all the angels / Why is my presence so painful?"" — take on new meaning.

When the show was over and the small, socially-distant crowd of NPR employees dispersed, our crew began to wipe everything down with disinfectant wipes. Our incredible audio engineer, Josh Rogosin, started to set up for what we thought would be the next Tiny Desk show, the Pulitzer Prize-winning opera p r i s m by Ellen Reid and Roxie Perkins.

Josh Rogosin remembers the day clearly. ""After the Sudan Archives concert, I optimistically went about setting up for a string quartet plus an eight-person choir and two vocal soloists, plus harp and conductor,"" he told me. ""About halfway through my set-up, our boss gathered us around the Tiny Desk and made the painful but obvious decision. No more Tiny Desks until further notice.""

Three months later, things are not looking much better. I miss it madly. There will be Tiny Desk concerts again and the celebration will be joyous. We'll do it as soon as it feels safe. Stay tuned and enjoy the nearly 1,000 concerts in our archives.

Watch 'Weird Al' Yankovic's’s Tiny Desk concert from 2010: https://www.npr.org/2010/06/22/127983640/-weird-al-yankovic-tiny-desk-concert


Stephen Thompson | June 22, 2010

Several generations of nerds can chart the course of their lives against the career trajectory of ""Weird Al"" Yankovic. For me, his 1984 album In 3-D was the first record I ever owned, and his appearance at the Wausau County Fair in 1985 was the second concert I ever attended. I spent my 17th birthday being driven to the movie theater — by my mother, of course — to watch UHF, Yankovic's debut as a leading man, by myself. (And I mean by myself; my ticket marked a significant percentage of the film's theatrical grosses.) The night before I turned 20, I jumped into a makeshift mosh pit when Yankovic and his band played ""Smells Like Nirvana"" at a concert; when I staggered back to my seat, winded, it was the first time I'd ever felt old.

Sorry for the self-indulgent reminiscences, but Yankovic has had a profoundly positive impact on my life for nearly 30 years. Not only did he seem like a kindred oddball during that horrible stretch of adolescence when everyone feels like their pants are falling down at all times; he also taught me to look at pop music in a different way — to take it apart, analyze it, laugh at the cliches and put it back together in funny and playful ways. He took my youthful obsession with pop music and fed it like no one else.

Last fall, I was honored to write the liner notes to a two-disc greatest-hits package called The Essential ""Weird Al"" Yankovic, in which I laid out the case for the man's enshrinement in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. More than three decades of pop-cultural relevance, during which time many of the stars he parodied came and went. Twelve million albums sold, with the highest-charting one (2006's Straight Outta Lynwood) arriving more than a quarter of a century into his career. A band talented enough to slide seamlessly into dozens of pitch-perfect personae.

But even after all those accomplishments, Yankovic and his band had one milestone yet to reach: They hadn't yet played their first Tiny Desk Concert. For a band accustomed to perfectionism on stage and in the studio — knowing how to get every note right is, after all, a vital component of any good parody — the modest surroundings and single microphone necessitated some adjustment. But in these three Yankovic originals (1988's ""Good Old Days,"" 1992's ""You Don't Love Me Anymore"" and the new White Stripes pastiche ""CNR""), it's remarkable how quickly the singer and his band adjust and thrive. Now can they get into the Hall of Fame?

It’s the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

June 17, 2020 | Abby O'Neill -- On a brisk February morning, Alicia Keys, full of effervescence, entered NPR through the loading dock wearing a canary yellow faux fur coat. During our ride to the fourth floor, she joked about how she hadn't been invited to play at the Tiny Desk. That, of course, wasn't exactly true. We worked on and off for years to make this moment happen, and I can say wholeheartedly that it was worth the wait.

Alicia Keys has an aura that you can sense the second she enters a room, or in my case, an elevator. She radiates compassion and kindness. This spirit is the key to Keys's songwriting, which is rooted in introspection and mindfulness.

As she approached her piano, a bit surprised at the amount of people in the room, she smiled and remarked over her shoulder, ""Gee, the Tiny Desk is tiny!"" She kicked off the set with an uncanny ode to combat the darkness of this moment in American history: ""Show Me Love,"" a single she released in 2019. No one could have predicted then how much her lyrics and musical healing would be crucial during this emotionally fraught time of unprecedented political and racial unrest, heightened by three months of quarantine due to a global pandemic.

The stand-out moment during her Tiny Desk was the premiere of ""Gramercy Park"", a song from her upcoming self-titled album, ALICIA, which is set to be released this fall. It's one of those timeless songs that will transcend radio formats and genres, with lyrics that address how utter selflessness and worrying about making everyone happy but yourself can throw your own center askew. The song's spiritual refrain is sure to be a sing-along moment for the rest of Keys's career.

She told the crowd after ""Gramercy Park"" that she's struggled with appeasing people her whole life, but she's trying harder now to set boundaries. Luckily for the Tiny Desk audience, that resolution didn't pertain to this concert. After wrapping up what was to be a three-song set with her latest single ""Underdog,"" which you may have seen her perform at this year's Grammys, the crowd begged for an encore. After crowdsourcing suggestions, she and her band delivered a riveting rendition of Keys's breakout 2001 single, ""Fallin'.""

The world, now more than ever, needs more love, reflection and accountability – a mantra that's woven into every fiber of Alicia Keys's being and every lyric of her songs.

Stephen Thompson | June 1, 2010

It was a cat-herding catastrophe waiting to happen. The members of The Rock Bottom Remainders — an informal and revolving assortment of good-natured authors who masquerade as a rock band for charity — were in Washington, D.C., to raise money for World Vision and America's Promise Alliance. So NPR Music invited them to congregate behind Bob Boilen's desk for a Tiny Desk Concert: Dave Barry, Ridley Pearson, Scott Turow, Amy Tan, Roy Blount Jr., Kathy Kamen Goldmark and Sam Barry, none of whom brought any instruments and all of whom seemed unaccustomed to playing music for crowds amassed in unusual places.


Fortunately, they also brought The Byrds' Roger McGuinn, who'd been performing with The Rock Bottom Remainders as a guest ringer — in part to help mask the fact that, among other things, the band hadn't rehearsed very many songs. Not surprisingly, given the self-deprecating nature of the group (""We're gonna attempt a song involving actual singing now,"" Dave Barry solemnly announces early on), everyone knows enough to turn the spotlight over to McGuinn, who starts out by leading The Rock Bottom Remainders in a sweetly shambling sing-along performance of ""Sloop John B."" The others join in, but looking at, say, Roy Blount Jr., it's clear that they're mostly spectators at their own show.


It's appropriate, then, that they back off almost completely for McGuinn's performance of ""May the Road Rise to Meet You,"" which demonstrates once again that great beauty can appear out of nowhere under unlikely circumstances. The Rock Bottom Remainders' members don't take themselves even a bit seriously, but for a few minutes, their music was... not brilliant, exactly, but certainly brilliant-adjacent. There's genius, and then there's having the good sense to stand nearby.",2022-10-24 15:40:27,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0Y3feR_WTw,NORMAL,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o0Y3feR_WTw/default.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o0Y3feR_WTw/mqdefault.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o0Y3feR_WTw/hqdefault.jpg,NPR Music,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A

June 1, 2020 | Stephen Thompson -- You can probably guess that we recorded the original Broadway cast of Hadestown before the coronavirus pandemic made live theater (live anything) an untenable risk. The reminders are everywhere — in the way 16 performers bunch up behind the desk, singing formidably in close proximity as a large crowd gathers just off camera — that this took place in the Before-Times. To be specific, on March 2.

We'd actually been trying to put this show together since the spring of 2019, when Hadestown was a freshly Tony-nominated hit musical. We hit several delays along the way due to scheduling issues, only to end up rushing in an attempt to record while playwright Anaïs Mitchell — who wrote both the musical and the 2010 folk opera on which it's based — was eight months pregnant.

Thankfully, we captured something truly glorious — a five-song distillation of a robust and impeccably staged Broadway production. A raucous full-cast tone-setter, ""Way Down Hadestown"" lets Hermes (André De Shields, in a role that won him a Tony) and Persephone (Kimberly Marable, filling in for Amber Gray) set the scene before a medley of ""Come Home With Me"" and ""Wedding Song"" finds Orpheus (Reeve Carney) and Eurydice (Eva Noblezada) meeting and falling in love. ""When the Chips Are Down"" showcases the three Fates — spirits who often drive the characters' motivations — as played by Jewelle Blackman, Yvette Gonzalez-Nacer and Kay Trinidad. And in ""Flowers,"" Eurydice looks back with regret and resignation on her decision to leave Orpheus for the promise of Hadestown.

Finally, the set concludes with ""Why We Build the Wall,"" which quickly became Hadestown's most talked-about number. (Mitchell wrote it a full decade before the 2016 election, but you'd never know it.) Though the song includes the full cast, it's also a show-stopping showcase for the sonorous thunder of Patrick Page, who performs with a gravity befitting the king of the underworld.

May 27, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- For me, it was beyond surreal to watch Wire performing at my desk, in broad daylight, in 2020. I spent many an evening over the past 40 years, listening to their original, artful bursts of noise and imagery, seeing them in dark clubs in the '80s and beyond. From the time I first heard them in 1977, few bands have encapsulated my musical aesthetics like Wire.


And yet there they were, with three original bandmates: Colin Newman, singing his enigmatic poetry, and those driving rhythms of Graham Lewis on bass and Robert Grey (aka Robert Gotobed) on drums. Matthew Simms was the 'new' bandmate, having now played with the band for the past 10 years. What's most remarkable is how the sound of songs such as ""Cactused"" from their 17th album, Mind Hive, sit so well next to ""French Film Blurred"" from their 1978 album — and one of my favorite records ever made — Chairs Missing.


Try and imagine your favorite artist today, playing a concert in someone's office in 2062 and still having an emotional impact with extraordinary new songs. As I said, it's beyond surreal and genuinely thrilling.

Watch Bettye LaVette’s Tiny Desk concert from 2010: https://www.npr.org/2010/05/21/127043684/bettye-lavette-tiny-desk-concert

Frannie Kelley | May 21, 2010

We were not prepared for Bettye LaVette's appearance in the NPR Music offices. We thought we were — having set up our cameras and recording gear and signed in all the friends who had heard she was scheduled to play and beaten down our door.

But then she blew into the room and conquered it before she'd sung a single note. She teased Bob Boilen mercilessly and told all the women how beautiful they were. She had reporters and producers doing her bidding all over the building. But after we cleared a spot for her to perch on the corner of Bob's desk, she went to work.

The first song she sang, a cover of Ringo Starr's ""It Don't Come Easy,"" killed the room. LaVette hunched her shoulders, dropped her chin and yanked the song out of her throat. It felt like a confession. Every movement she made — whether she threw her head back in a desperate wail or drooped it to close a phrase signifying defeat — shoved further meaning into the words. Her voice was bruising, shocking, and she sang really loud.

Before she began, LaVette asked us to close the blinds. It was 3 in the afternoon, but she said she was about to sing some night songs. She sang end of the night songs: ""It Don't Come Easy,"" ""Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me,"" ""Nights in White Satin."" (Due to licensing issues, only ""It Don't Come Easy"" is available in the video above, at least for the time being.) But she took those songs — glammed up and kindly lit in the recordings we remember — and tore off their clothes. She wrestled them to the ground.

May 18, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- Lankum's journey from Ireland to the Tiny Desk was a wild and bumpy adventure. First, visa problems forced them to cancel their late February date. A week later, much of the world is more worried about COVID-19, though daily patterns here hadn't changed. They arrived in New York, hopped in their van to Washington, D.C., only to have that break down. Finally, after all that, some good news: While in their new van heading to the Tiny Desk, the Dublin quartet received news that its brilliant album The Livelong Day had won Ireland's Choice Music Prize Album of the Year!

All of this was a build-up to a Tiny Desk concert I'll never forget. I, too, am a massive fan of the drones from the uilleann pipes, harmonium, concertina and the stunning voice of Radie Peat. The Livelong Day to my ears has as much in common with Irish tradition as it does to electronic music, though everything they do is acoustic. But the power and heft of what brothers Ian and Daragh Lynch, Cormac MacDiarmada, and Radie Peat convey through their reeds, strings, and vocals are deeply stirring emotionally and have stuck with me all these months since this concert's recording.

A week later I saw Lankum in concert. It was the last one I attended in a real venue and the world was rapidly changing. Their journey home, I trust, was frightening. The idea of getting on a plane was so very different from just a few weeks before. I know it was tough, but I'm ever so grateful for this life experience and grateful to be able to share it here.

7Wd5s78Lghw,Lionel Loueke: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert From The Archives,"We've been filming Tiny Desk concerts for more than 10 years. While revisiting our archives, we discovered that some of our earliest concerts never made it to YouTube! 
Watch Lionel Loueke’s Tiny Desk concert from 2010: https://www.npr.org/2010/04/26/126159612/lionel-loueke-tiny-desk-concert

Patrick Jarenwattananon | April 26, 2010

Listen to any Lionel Loueke record long enough, and you'll wonder, ""How did he make that noise?"" The West African-born jazz guitarist has developed an extensive palette of sounds, experimenting with low tunings, fast finger techniques, nylon strings, acoustic and electric axes, even jamming paper in his strings. And he also sings — or, more accurately, vocalizes. The clicks, wet smacks, the singing-along-to-his-solos, even the spasmodic speaking-in-tongues exhortations; he says they just come naturally to him.

Naturally, when Loueke's trio came to Washington, D.C., earlier this year, we asked him to demonstrate his toolkit in a Tiny Desk Concert. The Tiny Desk is a pretty tiny desk, but it still felt a bit unfair to the rest of his band. The group is led by Loueke almost in name only; the drummer and bassist both compose for the group, and their input has shaped Loueke's language, even apart from the trio, for more than 10 years of playing together.

Luckily, the trio arrived at our cramped stage, whereupon drummer Ferenc Nemeth shrugged and declared, ""Yeah, I'll play."" I asked him whether I could get him a snare drum or cymbal stands or anything, and he waved me off, pulling out bells, bundle sticks and a little rig set up around a hand drum and a jangly tambourine. Game on.

Nemeth and Loueke treated us to impromptu duet versions of ""Vi Ma Yon"" — a traditional song that appears on Loueke's latest, Mwaliko — and another tune from the group's songbook, ""Merci."" (Their recording of Wayne Shorter's ""Nefertiti,"" which doesn't appear on this page, will be available on A Blog Supreme this week.) Jammy and exploratory, it felt like jazz with West African accents — or was it West African music with jazz sensibilities? See and hear for yourself.

kjXNLLlbnRc,Frances Quinlan: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Feb. 18, 2020 | Marissa Lorusso -- This performance was recorded on March 2, 2020. We will continue releasing Tiny Desk videos of shows that had already been taped. In light of current events, NPR is postponing new live tapings of Tiny Desk Concerts. In the meantime, check out Tiny Desk (home) concerts! They’re recorded by the artists in their home. It’s the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Frances Quinlan showed up to NPR HQ in Washington, D.C., in February, just after Presidents' Day — which explains her multiple mid-performance jokes about White House residents. But even if her Tiny Desk concert had happened in July, the allusions wouldn't have surprised me. As a songwriter, Quinlan is piercingly astute at making connections between her present reality and the wider world; her songs often narrate other stories she's heard, fictional or real, from a place of wide-eyed empathy. (It's unclear, however, whether George Washington's teeth — the subject of one such mid-set digression — have made it into one of her songs.)

Quinlan is a Tiny Desk veteran, having played here in 2015 with her indie-rock band, Hop Along. You could argue she has even more Tiny Desk experience than that; as Quinlan pointed out during her set, a can of Hop Along-branded beer has been sitting on the Tiny Desk shelves through numerous previous concerts, including Lizzo's.

This time around, she performed songs from her debut solo album, Likewise. She was accompanied by two musicians who played on Likewise: her Hop Along bandmate Joe Reinhart, on bass and guitar, and Molly Germer on violin, and their quiet accompaniment suited her expressive, introspective songs. Quinlan has the kind of voice that can pack an emotional punch in a whisper or expand to fill a room, and her songs seem to carry their own velocity – lurching forward and drawing back, with unique melodies that unfurl in unexpected and satisfying directions. At the Tiny Desk, it was a delight to watch it all unfold.

UGjWvL92_1s,Augustin Hadelich: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"This performance was recorded on Feb. 4, 2020. We will continue releasing Tiny Desk videos of shows that had already been taped.

May 11, 2020 | Tom Huizenga -- Violinists have special relationships with their instruments, almost like marriages. And so it was that when the Grammy-winning fiddler Augustin Hadelich came to play his Tiny Desk concert, he brought with him the equivalent of a new significant other.

Unpacking his beautiful Guarneri del Gesù, built around 1744, Hadelich admitted that he had played this extraordinary violin for only about a month. But when he began to make music on the instrument, it was clear that these two are perfectly matched. The violin, once owned by the famed virtuoso Henryk Szeryng, has been called one of the finest concert violins in the world.

And Hadelich has been called one of the finest concert violinists in the world. Born in Italy to German parents, he studied at Juilliard in New York. His sweep of the top awards at the International Violin Competition of Indianapolis in 2006 launched his career.

With his discerning pianist Kuang-Hao, Hadelich put the 276-year-old del Gesù through its paces in the propulsive ""40% Swing"" from John Adams' Road Movies. He made the instrument croon sweetly in Dvořák's ""Humoresque,"" a chestnut of old world charm, especially in violinist Fritz Kreisler's beloved arrangement. And a burst of energy returned to round out the set with the bustling ""Burlesca,"" by Czech composer Josef Suk, a favorite pupil of Dvořák who later became his son-in-law.

Hadelich and his fiddle might still be in that honeymoon period, but for his sake – and ours – let's hope they remain the best of friends.

May 4, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- Jon Batiste came to the Tiny Desk with some surprises back in November of 2019. Midway through his set, he stopped to say, ""it's the first time we're ever playing these songs, and it's the first time we're playing together."" The New Orleans musician came to the Tiny Desk not with his late-night house band, but with an all-new cast. His all-female collaborators — Endea Owens on acoustic bass, Negah Santos on percussion, Sarah Thawer on drums, and Celisse Henderson on guitar and vocals — were an inspiration.

As is often the case when musicians perform in Washington (and especially blocks from the Capitol) the banter hinted at the political. Jon Batiste stopped to tell the NPR crowd, ""we're playing some music, and we're coping. The times are in an interesting place, but music is always that universal language that can bring people in a room together."" Little did Jon know how those words would feel six months later.

Jon Batiste took us through some of the many sides of his rich musical history, from the soulful ballad titled ""Cry,"" to the jazz and hip-hop inspired, ""Coltrane"" and a rocking Motown-inspired tune, ""Tell The Truth,"" before ending with a bit of church with, ""I Need You."" In just over 15 minutes, Jon Batiste bounced from playing the Wurlitzer to the electric guitar to the piano and then a melodica, all the while singing and sharing his talents and bringing us joy in interesting times.

Watch Laura Veirs' Tiny Desk concert from 2010: https://www.npr.org/2010/03/01/124015786/laura-veirs-tiny-desk-concert

Mike Katzif | March 1, 2010

If Laura Veirs was in a songwriting rut prior to recording her lovely and spare new album, July Flame, it doesn't show. Perhaps the return to pared-down and simply constructed songs worked to arouse musical inspiration, because the record is among her best. For the most part, the songs on July Flame orbit around Veirs' acoustic-guitar playing and voice. But it's her idiosyncratic lyrics and melodic flourishes that imbue her music with sun-dappled warmth; hers is the sound of immense, wide-open spaces.

All the perfectly chosen instrumentation in the songs' arrangements — the fluttering plucks of strings, the subtle vibrato of a marimba, the stirring backing vocal harmonies, the swooping violins — come courtesy of producer Tucker Martine. There's a noticeable comfort between them; Martine has now worked with Veirs on her last six albums, and he seems to know just how to augment her delicate voice with just the right touches to let her shine.

When a very pregnant Veirs settled in for this performance behind Bob Boilen's desk — a venue that can be a little awkward for many musicians — that same warmth and intimacy shone through. After a slight musical miscue, endearing enough to keep in the final video, Veirs and her small backing band treated the NPR Music offices to a three-song set that introduced us into her musical world.",2022-10-24 15:37:37,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fym6Yxbmki8,NORMAL,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fym6Yxbmki8/default.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fym6Yxbmki8/mqdefault.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fym6Yxbmki8/hqdefault.jpg,NPR Music,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A

April 29, 2020 | Stephen Thompson -- Back in the Before-Times, when Tiny Desk concerts were held in front of gatherings of people — ""crowds,"" we called them — we'd remind everyone in attendance to silence their cell phones. When the music was loud enough, it didn't matter if people followed instructions. But when Daughter of Swords came to grace us with a few hushed folk songs, the music was so eerily still, you could have heard a phone vibrate.

Though she's joined by a full band here, Daughter of Swords was originally envisioned as a solo project for Alexandra Sauser-Monnig, who returned for a second Tiny Desk concert after making a stop as one-third of the wonderful Mountain Man. Sauser-Monnig's counterparts in that group have already been by as individuals — Molly Sarlé in a solo set, Amelia Randall Meath as the singer of Sylvan Esso — so it was only natural that Sauser-Monnig would return, too, this time to showcase songs from 2019's gorgeous Dawnbreaker (as well as a new track called ""Prairie Winter Wasteland"").

Between the rustic sweetness of the arrangements and Sauser-Monnig's between-song banter — which included, among other things, a low-key discussion of breakfast foods — Daughter of Swords' set doubles as a fine way to trick your doctor into not prescribing blood-pressure medication. In anxious times, it'll settle you right down.

April 28, 2020 | Tom Huizenga -- The harpsichord is a beautiful but notoriously fussy instrument. After we wheeled one behind Bob Boilen's desk, it took the bulk of an hour to get the tuning just perfect for the very first Tiny Desk harpsichord recital. Given that our guest was Mahan Esfahani, the instrument's most ardent advocate, we were willing to wait.

Esfahani, who grew up near Washington, D.C., but is now based in Prague, chose a double manual harpsichord — meaning two keyboards. This one was built by specialists Barbara and Thomas Wolf in 1991, but is based on a famous French instrument from 1770.

The carefully selected repertoire began with classics: a pair of sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti, which share the same key but couldn't be more opposite in personality. With elaborate curlicue ornaments in both hands, the opening sonata presents a sober, regal outlook. Its partner is a flamboyant rocker, with the hands chasing each other across the two keyboards like a cat and mouse.

Esfahani made sure to also include a modern piece. Mel Powell's angular and slightly jazzy ""Recitative and Toccata Percossa,"" from 1951, is a tour de force in this artist's hands. It drives home a point he likes to make — that while the harpsichord had its heyday in the 18th century, it's still a vibrant instrument and very much alive. ""There are over 50 modern concertos for the harpsichord,"" he told the audience.

Returning to the baroque, Esfahani closed with a little-known chaconne by Johann Pachelbel. Its steady bassline and colorful variations were a pleasant reminder of the composer's one-hit claim to fame, ""Pachelbel's Canon."" Although the music stopped there, Esfahani's performance continued as he stayed for a while behind the desk, happily regaling the harpsichord-curious on the finer points of the instrument.

Watch Abaji’s Tiny Desk concert from 2010: https://www.npr.org/2010/02/15/123533606/abaji-tiny-desk-concert

Tom Huizenga | February 15, 2010

Not many of us were familiar with Abaji before he came to play this Tiny Desk Concert. But after he left, we all knew a bit more about music from half a world away, and a lot more about a big-hearted musician with a quick wit and a passion for instruments.

Abaji's work spans many cultures and languages. With roots in Greece, Turkey, Armenia and France, he's at home strumming a twangy bouzouki, blowing into a breathy duduk or bowing a soft-toned kamancheh. When recording his latest album, Origine Orients, he played 10 different instruments, many of them simultaneously, with no second takes or overdubs. It took him just two days.

Abaji begins with a song from the album, ""Min Jouwwa"" (""From Inside""), accompanying himself on an invention of his own, a tricked-out Western-style guitar with extra strings, giving it the sound of an Egyptian oud. He follows it with ""Summertime,"" with its haunting, serpentine riffs on the bouzouki and verses alternating between Arabic and English. Scatting in Arabic never sounded so natural.

After the cameras shut down, Abaji hung around for a while to rummage through his menagerie of instruments, showing us — and demonstrating — a large duduk (an Armenian cousin of the oboe), an Indonesian suling (flute) and a Colombian saxophone (of sorts) made from bamboo that looked more like a snake. It was something like getting a lesson in world music from a good friend.",2022-10-24 15:37:16,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICBtVbDVinw,NORMAL,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ICBtVbDVinw/default.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ICBtVbDVinw/mqdefault.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ICBtVbDVinw/hqdefault.jpg,NPR Music,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A

April 22, 2020 | Abby O'Neill -- In mid-February, I was in Los Angeles for the Grammy Awards and attended an impromptu birthday celebration for Anderson .Paak. His Tiny Desk concert with The Free Nationals, filmed in 2016, is the most popular in the history of the series. Asked to share what he was thankful for, Ron Avant, keyboardist of The Free Nationals, replied, ""I'm grateful that the Tiny Desk has made my face recognizable around the globe"" and .Paak commented on what a powerful impact his Tiny Desk concert has had on his career.

So it was a special return when The Free Nationals arrived in the nation's capital to showcase their new tunes on March 4, before the coronavirus crisis had set in. Lots of NPR staffers showed up in the hopes that a surprise guest might be in store. Ron Avant invoked Roger Troutman of Zapp on the talk box, while newcomer India Shawn, radiant in a red jump suit, crooned Daniel Caesar's ""Beauty & Essex"" in a sultry register. India, formerly a background singer for .Paak and now an emerging solo artist, also sang lead on the second song, ""On Sight."" Both songs are from the band's self-titled debut, which came out at the end of last year.

Then ""Cheeky Andy,"" aka Anderson.Paak, surprised the audience with his signature smile and spunky energy that light up every room and screen he graces. .Paak reflected warmly on his first foray behind the Tiny Desk and then launched into ""Gidget,"" a song with a groove so catchy that it makes you want to two-step in your living room. .Paak wasn't the only special guest. Jamaican roots reggae singer Chronixx returned to the Desk to perform his ""Eternal Light,"" a song he recorded with The Free Nationals on their album. He seemed stunned at the number of fans in the audience this time, swaying to the sound of his voice and obviously uplifted by the message of gratitude and positivity in his songs.

Of the many things to be grateful for, seeing The Free Nationals, Anderson. Paak, and Chronixx return to the Desk is top tier.

Robin Hilton | February 1, 2010

David Rawlings is a remarkably gifted producer, session guitarist and singer who's most widely known for his contributions to other musicians' work — particularly his longtime partnership with folk and traditional country artist Gillian Welch. But when he and Welch stopped by NPR for this Tiny Desk Concert, it was to promote Rawlings' own album — the first he's ever recorded under his name (actually, it's under the moniker Dave Rawlings Machine). For A Friend of a Friend, Rawlings took on lead vocals and songwriting duties, and got some of his old friends to help out. Welch appears throughout the album, of course, along with other artists such as Ketch Secor and Morgan Jahnig of Old Crow Medicine Show.

Welch and Rawlings settled in to play together at Bob Boilen's desk as easily as if they were slipping on a pair of old boots. They've got the sort of magnetic chemistry that comes with writing and recording together for more than 15 years, but even with that history and their friendship, the two had to rethink the way they do things for Friend of a Friend.

""A lot of the arrangements we'd worked out over the years — the way we put chords, the way we sing together — I was shocked at how little they worked for my voice or my record,"" Rawlings says.

""We had learned to make records in a particular way because we were always framing [Welch's] voice, which is this large, takes-up-a-lot-of-space, very intimate, very good-sounding thing,"" he adds. ""A beautiful tone. So you can frame it in a skeletal way. It almost seems to me that the less you put on her records, the more powerful they are. But when we started working that way with my voice, which is so different, it turned out that nothing from that approach was valid. So we had to find different sounds and treatments that we were happy with. I was really surprised when we started that we were in territory as uncharted as we were. We broke new ground from necessity.""

In this Tiny Desk Concert recording, Rawlings and Welch give a breathtaking performance to a packed office at NPR Music. Each was getting over a bad case of bronchitis, though you'd never know it. For a typical soundcheck, most artists will piddle through a few bars of something. But Rawlings and Welch took a full, and utterly thrilling, run through Bill Monroe's ""I'm on My Way Back to the Old Home."" It was almost as though they couldn't stop once they started. If they hadn't stopped, that would have been fine by us.",2022-10-24 15:36:53,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR1BUVFToSE,NORMAL,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WR1BUVFToSE/default.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WR1BUVFToSE/mqdefault.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WR1BUVFToSE/hqdefault.jpg,NPR Music,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A

April 15, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- Angelica Garcia decorated the Tiny Desk with colorful fabrics, orange flowers, a fuchsia dress, and a great deal of pride in what she calls her ""Salva-Mex-American"" heritage. Her song ""Orange Flower"" got my attention back in 2016, but I thought of her only as a Virginia rock and roller. Not anymore. Angelica Garcia's music in the 2020s embraces her heritage, her life growing up in Los Angeles, and the ranchero music she heard from her family. Angelica moved to Virginia at age seventeen. The songs she sings at the Tiny Desk, all from her album Cha Cha Palace, reflect the way she was seen, or more to the point, not seen, in her new home. ""Jícama"" captures that feeling of invisibility:

""I see you, but you don't see me
Jícama, jícama, guava tree
I been trying to tell ya but you just don't see
Like you, I was born in this country.""

On the opening song, ""Guadalupe,"" Angelica expresses respect for La Virgen de Guadalupe, the patron saint of Mexico, singing ""I wanna be like her."" Guadalupe inspires her to declare that ""power isn't defined by your physique."" In this Tiny Desk concert, Angelica, along with her Richmond bandmates, powerfully convey the all-important message that we are all part of this country's colorful fabric, and we all deserve to be heard.

April 13, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- Sometimes I'll see a band at my desk and wish I could jump in and join. That's what happened when Tōth played the Tiny Desk. I felt a deep connection to both the fun and emotion in their music. Besides, I loved their outfits. The last time we saw Alex Toth at the Tiny Desk, he was standing against the shelves, trumpet to his lips. He performed in 2015 with Rubblebucket and his partner Kalmia Travers was singing lead. This time around, Alex sings about their relationship's end in the song ""Copilot.""

""Thought you were my copilot na na na
My copilot na na na na na
Now I know that you were just taking me for a ride
And that's alright it was a beautiful ride.""

""Copilot"" is one of two songs Tōth performed at the Tiny Desk from his album Practice Magic and Seek Professional Help When Necessary. These songs are thoughtful, honest reflections on the end of his personal relationship with Kalmia Travers (although it continues professionally). The arrangements here are spare but textured with bits of Alex on trumpet and touches from Ben Chapoteau-Katz on sax and electronics. The rhythm section of drummer Rebecca Lasaponaro and bassist Ryan Dugre pin it all together. There is a debut here, before the ending singalong song. The new tune ""Turnaround (Cocaine Song)"" is a funny/sad (and I'll assume true) tale of poorly timed indulgence at his Aunt Mary's funeral in New Jersey. The balance of storytelling and intriguing music are my sweet spots, so Tōth felt right at home at my desk.

https://www.npr.org/2010/01/20/122589471/the-low-anthem-tiny-desk-concert

Bob Boilen | January 20, 2010

This past summer in Newport, R.I., I saw The Low Anthem perform as part of the Newport Folk Festival's 50th anniversary. I had heard the band's album Oh My God, Charlie Darwin early that year and found it simple, gorgeous and thought-provoking. It's hard to do what The Low Anthem does so well — play sullen, spacious music — at a noisy and crowded music festival. But it did, and it won over an awful lot of fans in the process.

Later, I was talking to Jay Sweet, who picks much of the talent that comes to Newport these days, and I told him how taken I was by The Low Anthem. Sweet replied, ""These guys are from around here. Last year, they were volunteers at the festival, picking up trash.""

I love that story, and I love this band's spirit. When The Low Anthem came to NPR Music to play a Tiny Desk Concert, the band seemed humbled and comfortable sitting on and around my desk, playing music as if it were hanging around in someone's living room. So grab something warm to drink, gather 'round, and pay special attention to the cell-phone trick at the end of ""This God Damn House"" — it's something else.",2022-10-24 15:36:30,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanRDr0m4IU,NORMAL,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UanRDr0m4IU/default.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UanRDr0m4IU/mqdefault.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UanRDr0m4IU/hqdefault.jpg,NPR Music,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A

April 6, 2020 | Josh Rogosin -- The Lumineers showed up at the Tiny Desk with family, friends and crew who travel with the tight-knit touring band. One special guest in particular was Lenny, the toddler son of lead singer Wes Schultz. As soon as Bob Boilen met Lenny, Bob searched for every toy he could find on the shelves behind his desk to entertain the restless tyke.

I've always been struck by how this band can make a crowd of 6,000 fans feel like an intimate jam session. Halfway through The Lumineers' set at the Newport Folk Festival in 2013, the entire band moved to the very back of the enormous crowd. I remember marveling that the worst spot in the field miraculously became the best.

Much of The Lumineers' Tiny Desk comes from the band's third LP, III, which tells a story of addiction in three acts. They began with gut-wrenching renditions of ""Gloria"" and ""Leader Of The Landslide""(accompanied by a cassette recording of crickets made on iPhones and dubbed to play on a boombox). The third track is also from III, but was an assignment from director M. Night Shyamalan. He tasked Schultz and his suspender-clad writing partner, Jeremiah Fraites, with composing a song for the end credits of a film. ""Jer and I worked really hard on that, and then he didn't need it,"" Schultz confessed. The result is the stark and haunting ""Salt And The Sea,""which strikes a different chord than any other song they've written.

It wouldn't be a Lumineers show without a foot-stompin' sing-along to end the set, which came with their crowd-pleasing hit ""Stubborn Love"". Stelth Ulvang demonstrated a level of barefoot acrobatics unrivaled at the desk thus far, not an easy feat (or should I say, feet). Right after the Tiny Desk concert, the band and entourage rushed off to play a little club in town called the Capital One Arena for another intimate show in front of 20,000 fans.

Four years ago, I dug Adam Arcuragi's CD out a stack of many and was struck by his voice: powerful, but without the unnecessary melodrama that encumbers so many talented singers.

Then there was the poetry. All you have to do is read the title to the first Arcuragi song we put on All Songs Considered, titled ""1981 (Or Waving at You As We Part at Light Speed Will Look Like I'm Standing Still)."" His recent recording, I Am Become Joy, was just as appropriately titled; an uplifting record whose sorrow is shaken by the sound of old friends shouting at the rafters. (Only, unlike most of my friends, they can sing.)

When Arcuragi came to play at my desk, most of the folks here at NPR hadn't heard him. After hearing the three songs he played, many walked away amazed.

April 3, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- Jesca Hoop last appeared at the Tiny Desk as a duet with Sam Beam (Iron & Wine) in the spring of 2016. They sang songs from their collaborative record Love Letters For Fire. This time around, Jesca Hoop came to the Tiny Desk with just her guitars, her lovely voice, and brilliant poetic songs. She has a magical way with words, and she opened her set with ""Pegasi,"" a beautiful song about the wild ride that is love, from her 2017 album Memories Are Now.

The two songs that follow are from her latest album, Stonechild, the album that captured my heart in 2019, and the reason I reached out to invite her to perform at my desk. ""All Time Low"" is a song, she says, for the ""existential underdog.""

""Michael on the outside, always looking in
A dog in the fight but his dog never wins
If he works that much harder, his ship might come in
He gives it the old heave-ho.""

And for her final tune, she plays my favorite song from Stonechild, ""Shoulder Charge."" It's a song that features a word that Jesca stumbled upon online: ""sonder,"" which you won't find in the dictionary. She tells the NPR crowd ""sonder"" is the realization ""that every person that you come across is living a life as rich and complex as your own."" And that realization takes you out of the center of things, something that is at the heart of ""Shoulder Charge"" and quite a potent moment in this deeply reflective and personal Tiny Desk concert.

March 30, 2020 | Bobby Carter -- I can't recall an artist so committed to making their Tiny Desk concert memorable. I'd met with Allen Stone weeks prior to go over priorities, expectations and the usual formalities, but this was different. His questions about how to prepare for the Tiny Desk signaled to me that he held this platform in the highest regard and that this wasn't just any appearance.

The Washington state native has a voice that we simply don't come across often. The old saying goes, ""He could sing the phone book and make it sound good."" His three graceful background singers and piano player provided the perfect compliment, but this set proved undoubtedly that his voice belongs right up front. He's been releasing music for more than a decade and touring the world, but last year's Building Balance is his best yet and he graced the desk with some of my favorites from the LP.

Before he rolled into a trilogy of Building Balance songs dedicated to his wife (who he said he's ""face first in love"" with), the set opened with the jarring ""American Privilege,"" which addresses his internal guilt about everything from materialism to being born white. Between songs, he couldn't contain his affinity for the Tiny Desk and his appreciation for the moment. ""It's a breath of fresh air for me that this is the way people want to hear music.""

Stephen Thompson | January 3, 2010

The Mountain Goats' John Darnielle keeps getting quieter, as his raw early bedroom recordings and bare-knuckle anthems continue to make way for polished ballads that whisper, seethe and mourn. The recent The Life of the World to Come at first feels strangely timid, but as its crushingly sad words sink in (""I am a flightless bird / There'll be no more after me,"" and so on), it hits slowly but deeply — less a punch than a gnawing ache.

In person, Darnielle's twitchy, nervous energy serves his fearless songwriting well: He exudes gentility and good humor in conversation, but his performances are utterly committed, with intensity that infuses his screams and whispers alike. In this solo Tiny Desk Concert, his four songs fit nearly into distinct categories: new and quiet (""Hebrews 11:40""), new and loud (""Psalms 40:2""), old and quiet (""Color in Your Cheeks,"" from All Hail West Texas), and old and loud (""Going to Georgia,"" from Zopilote Machine). It's no surprise that all four approaches serve him well.

Also, it should be noted that Darnielle drew a large and admiring crowd for this show, even though it appears in the video that it was attended exclusively by a photographer and the giant blond head of Lars Gotrich. Trust me: We wouldn't have missed this one for anything.

March 23, 2020 | Josh Rogosin -- The second Chris Robinson swaggered through the door, he was cracking jokes. ""Life is full of disappointments,"" he lamented. ""I thought the desk would be smaller!""

That didn't deter him or his brother Rich from belting out the hits from The Black Crowes' platinum album, Shake Your Money Maker. It's somehow been 30 years since the singles ""Jealous Again"" and ""Hard To Handle"" (their Otis Redding cover) received constant radio play, and the brothers have reunited for the 30th anniversary of that debut album.

In the early 1990s, I was taping songs off my bedroom stereo's FM tuner to learn Rich Robinson's iconic guitar lines. I was thrilled when the newly reunited Brothers Of A Feather decided to open their Tiny Desk concert with ""She Talks To Angels."" What I didn't expect was how great it would sound three decades on, stripped down to just voice and acoustic guitar. As soon as I heard the first lick, I was transported to my childhood bedroom. If you close your eyes, you can imagine this is what it sounded like when it was written in their childhood home outside Atlanta.

It's no secret that the brothers haven't always gotten along, and Chris and Rich Robinson have had musical successes outside their collaboration as The Black Crowes. But the combination of Chris' instantly recognizable raspy belt and Rich's catchy guitar riffs was always going to be the duo's legacy. Judging by the gasps from the lucky NPR staff in attendance, it's clear that their rift was not meant to last.

Classical music has a long and distinguished history in Australia, from the eccentric composer Percy Grainger to opera diva Joan Sutherland to the guests for this Tiny Desk concert: members of the Australian Chamber Orchestra.

This ensemble is among the most culturally current and agile in classical music today. Its young players are unafraid to take risks — or sport enlightened hair styles — and they delight in merging genres. On a recent U.S. tour, they played music by Handel, Bartok, Australia's amazing Carl Vine and Pink Floyd. The icing on the hipness cake is the orchestra's director, lead violinist Richard Tognetti. Last year, he and his surfing buddies were the subject of an award-winning documentary, Musica Surfica.

In this performance, Tognetti, his 1743 Guarneri del Gesu violin and an abbreviated version of the orchestra (five players) huddle around Bob Boilen's desk to prove they can really mix it up.

After a dynamic rendition of the opening movement from Maurice Ravel's String Quartet, Tognetti takes the spotlight in his own arrangement of Ravel's version of the traditional Kaddisch. That seamlessly slides into the song ""Oasis,"" featuring the composer Joseph Tawadros on the Egyptian oud (lute) and his brother James with percussion. It all adds up to a stirring tribute to the unpredictability and vitality of classical music itself.",2022-10-24 15:35:59,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1gUaOyE2dA,NORMAL,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_1gUaOyE2dA/default.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_1gUaOyE2dA/mqdefault.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_1gUaOyE2dA/hqdefault.jpg,NPR Music,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A

March 20, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- Arthur Moon came to the Tiny Desk armed with tiny keyboards, some toys, and (spoiler alert) a roll of aluminum foil. This band, the project of singer Lora-Faye Åshuvud has the quirky freshness I first heard from New York artists such as Laurie Anderson and Talking Heads in the late 1970s and more recently with Dirty Projectors. It comes off in the starkness of the sound, a spaciousness that leaves room for me to hear the storytelling in the songs, but always surprising me with aural delights.

The opening song at the Desk, ""Homonormo,"" begins with a kiss-off to the very city that birthed their sound, and a search for something normal, yet twisted.

""Hello
Send my kindest regards to New York
I'm gone, woo
I think I want to settle down
But weirder""

All three songs in this performance come from their brilliant self-titled 2019 album, an album too many missed, in my opinion. And this band pulls off these odd, unpredictable twists and turns with simplicity and charm. Playing the mini Mellotron and more is Cale Hawkins, who was last at the Tiny Desk with Raveena. Martin D. Fowler plays guitar and the bass lines on a Moog Bass. Aviva Jaye brought a table of toys and a wonderful voice, and Dave Palazola plays drums, cueing some of his with electronic triggers. There's anxiety in these songs, even when the chorus is ""I Feel Better,"" but there's a creative spirit in this anxiety, and then, of course too, there's the tin foil.

March 18, 2020 | Bobby Carter -- Rex Orange County, the low-key British pop star born Alex O'Connor, frames his emotions and struggles in a way that appears simple and linear at first. It's only after a few listens that you realize that most of us are incapable of the courage he demonstrates behind the microphone. The crowd of millennial and Gen Z staffers that gathered early for Rex's soundcheck at the Tiny Desk certainly appreciated that fact. There was a palpable connection between the 21-year-old singer and his fans that I don't see often at this stage in a musician's career. My guess is that they see themselves in him: introverted and shy, with the audacity to write and sing about his innermost thoughts.

The first time I saw Rex Orange County perform live was at the very small U Street Music Hall in Washington, D.C., in 2018 while he was supporting his second album, 2017s Apricot Princess. Luckily, I was familiar with the music; otherwise, I wouldn't have made out a word of what he was saying over the onslaught of screams by 500 fans. Astonishingly, less than two years later, he was playing the 6,000-seat Anthem, where the screams were no match for that soundsystem. We're in an age where young people are uninhibited and unafraid to address emotions, simple or complex. In that sense, his latest LP, Pony, is timely. He spoke with NPR and shared that he was incredibly unhealthy mentally throughout the making of the album. But there's an arch to Pony and by the time we get to the final song, ""It's Not The Same Anymore,"" he seems at peace with his new reality.

The entire band was eager, yet nervous during that soundcheck ... that is, until they felt the reaction of the onlookers. They quickly broke to the green room to steam their fresh white button-down shirts, which they purchased at the train station before they arrived. Rex pinned on a Tiny Desk button and was ready to perform a four-song set that included two highlights from Pony and two personal favorites of mine.

March 16, 2020 | Lyndsey McKenna and Marissa Lorusso -- Like many who have graced the Tiny Desk before him, the awkwardness of performing in a working office wasn't lost on Harry Styles. ""It just feels like you're in the way,"" he joked. But when you watch his set from behind Bob Boilen's desk, you'd never suspect any discomfort.

Backed by his touring band, Styles performed several songs from his latest solo album, Fine Line. Between tracks, he talked about the process of writing these songs: From the day off in Nashville that led to ""Watermelon Sugar,"" to the feeling of lovesickness he tried to capture in ""Adore You."" The camaraderie between the band was clear; and Styles was in on the joy, twirling in his seat between verses.

Styles might not necessarily be the first name that comes to mind when you think of public radio's only working, desk-music-discovery platform. After all, he's got a wildly devoted fanbase that's followed his every move since his One Direction days. In fact, before soundcheck had even started, a crowd of fans had begun to gather outside NPR HQ. They rightly suspected he would be playing a Tiny Desk concert after word got out that the former One Directioner was spotted in D.C. with no tour date on his public schedule.

But beyond the headlines, Styles has proven to be an artist who takes his songcraft and aesthetic seriously, interested in subverting expectations of what a pop star can and should sound like in 2020. That sense of unpretentious creativity is exactly what he brought to his Tiny Desk performance – and it definitely earned him some new adoring public radio fans in the process.

""I have to come into NPR more often,"" Styles said after he and his band played their first song. ""It's nice here.""

We — and our massive crowd of colleagues — couldn't agree more.

dSAKavA0fbw,Bowerbirds: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert From The Archives,"We've been filming Tiny Desk concerts for more than 10 years. While revisiting our archives, we discovered that some of our earliest concerts never made it to YouTube! 
Watch Bowerbirds’ Tiny Desk concert from 2009: https://www.npr.org/2009/11/16/120437553/bowerbirds-tiny-desk-concert

Mike Katzif | November 16, 2009

Bowerbirds' distinctively spare, handcrafted songs creak and swell like wooden floorboards in an old house. With singer-songwriter Phil Moore's acoustic guitar and Beth Tacular's accordion as its foundation — plus multi-instrumentalist Mark Paulson on violin and bass drum, and Brad Cook on acoustic bass — the group's stellar first album Hymns for a Dark Horse was an emotional ode to the pastoral. It was also one of my favorite records of 2007.

Bowerbirds' latest, Upper Air, picks up where its predecessor left off. But the band's music has become grander in scope: Not only does Upper Air introduce new instruments to the palette — decrepit bar-room pianos, hammered dulcimers, church organs and ornately composed string arrangements — but it also tackles bigger questions about finding humanity's place in nature and in the world.

In this captivating Tiny Desk Concert — performed on July 7, the same day Upper Air was officially released — the band seems to feel at home with the barest essentials, revealing lived-in melodies and inviting vocal harmonies that resonated throughout the NPR Music offices.",2022-10-24 15:35:07,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSAKavA0fbw,NORMAL,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dSAKavA0fbw/default.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dSAKavA0fbw/mqdefault.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dSAKavA0fbw/hqdefault.jpg,NPR Music,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A

March 13, 2020 | Abby O'Neill -- Showing her playful side, the 23-year old rapper, Chika came to the Tiny Desk chock-full of jokes and lots of flair, even bringing her sister in-tow to celebrate the occasion as a family affair. Chika was also the first hip-hop act to anchor her set with just a Peruvian cajón instead of a full, hard-hitting kit. The surprisingly stripped-down performance allowed her lyrics, with all their nuance, to take center stage — and the result was remarkable.

The impressive harmonies from Chika's four backup singers brought all the feels right out of the gate. Backed by a guitar melody that was both catchy and eerily haunting, Chika ripped through ""Industry Games,"" the first single and title cut to her major label, debut EP. Moving seamlessly between rap verse and melodic hooks, Chika showcased her unusual tonality, multi-cadence delivery and vocal range, with an effortless, double-time lyrical bounce.

These days, most hip-hop artists who come to the Tiny Desk try to one-up performances by their peers and think a blowout production is better. But Chika knew less was more. When your level of talent cuts through — and hits you directly in the gut as hers did — there's no need or time for any industry games.

zJferx79YyU,Kirill Gerstein: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"This performance was recorded on January 28, 2020. We will continue releasing Tiny Desk videos of shows that had already been taped.

It’s the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

March 11, 2020 | Tom Huizenga -- The last time pianist Kirill Gerstein was at NPR we gave him a full-size, grand piano to play in a big recording studio. But for this Tiny Desk performance, we scaled him down to our trusty upright. ""What will you ask me to play the next time,"" he quipped, ""a toy piano?""

Even if we had handed him a pint-sized instrument, I'm sure Gerstein could make it sing. Just listen to how Chopin's lyrical melodies, built from rippling notes and flamboyant runs, flow like a song without words in Gerstein's agile hands.

The Chopin Waltz, Op. 42 is one of the composer's hits, but the next two pieces Gerstein offers are rarities. The Berceuse for solo piano was written for Gerstein by Thomas Adès, adapted from his 2016 opera The Exterminating Angel. The work, both brooding and beautiful, receives its premiere recording at the Tiny Desk. Gerstein follows by dusting off a truly neglected – and quirky – Hungarian March by Franz Liszt. To my knowledge it's been recorded only once.

The 40-year-old pianist, born in Voronezh, Russia, taught himself to play jazz by listening to his parents' record collection. A chance meeting with vibraphonist Gary Burton landed him a scholarship to study jazz at Boston's Berklee College of Music. At age 14, Gerstein was the youngest to enroll at the institution.

Although he is among the elite pianists of the classical world (he won the coveted Gilmore Award in 2010), Gerstein's jazz background is still close to his heart. Which brings us to his lovely-rendered closer: Gershwin's ""Embraceable You,"" arranged by the American pianist Earl Wild.

Like all master performers, Gerstein gives you the illusion that he's making it all up as he goes along, even though the virtuosic transcription is intricately mapped out. And somehow, he makes that upright piano sound nine feet long.

March 12, 2020 | Robin Hilton -- Shortly into Coldplay's soundcheck, singer Chris Martin cut off the opening song, ""Cry Cry Cry,"" right in the middle. His band had brought along a nine-piece choir, and he asked them to take ""Cry Cry Cry"" one more time. When one of the singers asked if there was a problem, Martin replied, ""No, I'm just in f****** heaven right now!""

That feeling was obvious throughout the performance. Watching Martin at the keys, with the For Love Choir behind him and Coldplay guitarist Jonny Buckland at his side, you'd be forgiven for thinking it was the happiest day of his life. Laughing, bouncing to the music and playing off the crowd, Martin and company gave one of the most jubilant, uplifting and memorable performances we've ever had at the Tiny Desk.

Watching their gospel-infused take on ""Viva La Vida,"" it was hard not to beam with joy; hearing their stirring cover of Prince's ""1999"" brought on a mass urge to leap up and dance. The entire set was a perfectly executed showcase of the band's creative spirit and love of community through music.

""Viva La Vida"" was the only older track Coldplay performed, in addition to the surprise Prince cover. (The band had just performed at a Prince tribute show in January.) The other three songs — ""Cry Cry Cry,"" ""Broken"" and ""Champion of the World"" — are all from the band's stellar new album, Everyday Life, which was recorded with some of the singers on hand for the Tiny Desk. Martin joked that, ""In a very real way, they've Photoshopped our songs to be much better than they actually are."" Whether or not that's true, for at least this one sunny afternoon at the NPR Music offices, the choir — and Coldplay's inspired reworking of its own music — felt transcendent.

Stephen Thompson | November 2, 2009

When the makers of the 2007 romantic comedy Dan in Real Life wanted to convey an air of goodhearted whimsy, they turned soundtrack-writing duties over to Norwegian-born singer-songwriter Sondre Lerche. And why wouldn't they? For all his jazz-informed skills on the guitar, Lerche's greatest weapon is his flair for lightness and likeability.

Known as a varsity-level banterer on stage, Lerche puts all those skills to good use in this charming Tiny Desk Concert in the NPR Music offices. Performing three songs from his new album Heartbeat Radio — and introducing the title track with the disclaimer, ""It's taking some issue with radio, but it's not about you guys"" — he conveys all the lilting sweetness his fans have come to expect.",2022-10-24 15:33:34,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bepALS8u1zM,NORMAL,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bepALS8u1zM/default.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bepALS8u1zM/mqdefault.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bepALS8u1zM/hqdefault.jpg,NPR Music,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A

March 6, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- So much magic unfolded in such short order. Within the first moments of Taimane's stunning set, we hear her play fiery flamenco, a famous phrase from the opera Carmen, a touch of Bach and more than a nod to her Hawaiian homeland, all on her ukulele.

Taimane began playing ukulele at age five; these days, it's seemingly become an extension of her body. Her band includes guitarist Ramiro Marziani, violinist Melissa Baethoven and, on Cajon, Jonathan Heraux. Together they were impassioned and tight. Then along came a surprise. In what is a first at the Tiny Desk, a dancer named Li'o performed in a hau skirt made from dried lauhala leaves, with a lei of white conch wrapped around his neck. His Polynesian dance, along with the stick percussion, added to the beauty and the intensity. And that's just the first half.

Taimane chose to represent the elements of the earth on her latest album, Elemental, and she brought the most feisty of those elements to the Tiny Desk: ""Fire."" This music draws inspiration from Cuban traditions, with moments that are sensual as well as ecstatic. Taimane is a beautiful singer and a dynamic performer. I was fortunate enough to see her live performance last year at SXSW in Austin. It was as unforgettable then as it was here at the Tiny Desk.

March 4, 2020 | Suraya Mohamed -- ""I hope that you can enjoy this music because it can be heavy,"" drummer and bandleader Terri Lyne Carrington told the NPR crowd gathered for this Tiny Desk. ""We've tried to figure out a way to make it feel good and still give these messages.""

In the jazz world, Carrington is a celebrity — a 40-year professional musician who's won Grammy awards and performed with a seemingly infinite list of jazz dignitaries such as Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock and Geri Allen. An outspoken activist, teacher and mentor, she is also the founder and artistic director of the Berklee Institute of Jazz and Gender Justice, a multidisciplinary program whose motto is ""Jazz Without Patriarchy.""

Carrington visited the Desk with her current band, Social Science, a collaboration with pianist Aaron Parks and guitarist Matthew Stevens (both performing here). In the works for some time, their project culminated in 2016 when the cultural divisiveness brought on by the presidential election inspired the trio to take action. ""I think there's an awakening happening in society in general,"" Carrington writes on her website, ""I feel a calling in my life to merge my artistry with any form of activism that I'm able to engage in.""

This performance features music from the band's new album, Waiting Game. It's story-filled, groove-music performed by a group of accomplished musicians who improvise, rap and sing over complex but highly crafted and accessible instrumental motifs. A perfect synthesis of jazz, indie rock and hip-hop influences, the four songs they played address important, culturally relevant protest narratives: mass incarceration, collective liberation, police brutality and Native American genocide.

The third tune, ""Bells (Ring Loudly),"" written by Parks and Carrington, features actor Malcolm Jamal Warner who also wrote the spoken word. Carrington had just seen the Philando Castile shooting and her powerful lyrics imagined what she would say to the offending police officer.

""You took my love away from me.
I wanna know how did it feel to watch him tremble and bleed.
Tell me what gives you the right to kill so senselessly?
And when you're alone do you ever think of him or pray for his peace?""

""There is so much we can be angry about but you can't really stay there,"" Carrington told NPR. ""Instead, you can reach somebody on a human level.""

March 3, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- We've never had an original Mellotron at the Tiny Desk until now. Much like a Hammond organ, it's big, heavy and fragile. When they fired it up, with all its mechanical gears turning tape loops and moving play heads, the 15-year-old geek in me blissed out.a

The Mellotron was a magical 1960s invention that predates sampling. It's a keyboard instrument, with each piano key triggering a tape loop — the sound could be a string ensemble, a flamenco guitar, a saxophone and so much more. Think about the flute sounds on The Beatles' song ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" and you get the idea.

When Mellotron Variations keyboardist Robby Grant and I began discussing an all-Mellotron Tiny Desk, we quickly realized that having four of these beasts wouldn't fit behind my desk. So Robby Grant, Pat Sansone (Wilco) and Jonathan Kirkscey performed on the portable — and still incredible-sounding — 21st-century version of the instrument. At the same time, John Medeski (Medeski, Martin & Wood) tackled the original beast.

The sonic landscape they produce as Mellotron Variations is ingenious and impressive. It's a score with the audience as collective filmmaker, each one of us capable of creating imagery in our heads to this music of mystery and sometimes comedy. In the words of my teenaged self, ""it was a trip.""

March 2, 2020 | Felix Contreras -- When I produce a Tiny Desk Concert, one of my most important jobs is to make sure they run on time and that the performance sticks to our set time limit (roughly 15-minutes). So when Bob Weir and Wolf Bros achieved lift-off during a pre-show sound-check, it was my unthinkable responsibility to tell the guy who practically invented the jam band to... stop jamming.

Weir is a founding member of Grateful Dead, a band that launched countless jams from 1965 until the death of lead guitarist Jerry Garcia in 1995. And it also fell to me to keep looking at my watch during the performance, even as I realized that my favorite ""Dark Star"" jams alone lasted well beyond our fifteen-minute performance window. But the magic space behind the Desk has a way of bringing sharp focus to the task at hand, leading to exquisite performances that go well beyond the pale.

Such was the case in this gig by Bobby and his Wolf Bros, Jay Lane (drums) and Don Was (bass), as they played a set that was rich in Grateful Dead lore and that will likely create new memories for the Deadheads who were in the room and beyond.

""Only a River,"" from Weir's 2016 solo album Blue Mountain, feels like a memorial to Jerry Garcia, with a reference to the Shenandoah River, a body of water Garcia famously made reference to on the song, ""A Shenandoah Lullaby."" Weir turns the chorus into a mantra and seems to evoke the spirit of his fallen bandmate.

And what would a Grateful Dead-related performance be without a Bob Dylan song? The intimacy of the Tiny Desk turns Weir into a sage Master Storyteller during a version of ""When I Paint My Masterpiece"" with its reference to Botticelli and a lonely Roman hotel room.

With the addition of special guest, Mikaela Davis on harp, the final stretch of two Hunter-Garcia tunes takes on legendary status. When Weir switches to electric guitar midway during ""Bird Song,"" I looked at my watch because I knew we were in for some time travel. And the band didn't disappoint as the rhythmic interplay between Weir and Davis showed off his singular rhythm guitar style, honed from more than thirty years of playing alongside one the most idiosyncratic lead guitarists in modern music.

And I ain't gonna lie: I teared up at the end of ""Ripple,"" Grateful Dead's fifty-year-old sing-along from their album American Beauty. And it wasn't because of the treat of being just five feet from the action, but because of the song's celebration of hope and optimism, found in the spirit of all of the band's music. Bob Weir continues to evoke that spirit every time he picks up a guitar; and as we all sang along at the end, we evoked that spirit too: ""Let there be songs, to fill the air.""

Indeed.

Stephen Thompson | July 27, 2009 

Like many of Sarah Siskind's fans, I'd never heard of her until Bon Iver started covering her song ""Lovin's for Fools"" at its shows — sometimes with the band Bowerbirds, sometimes on its own and sometimes with Siskind herself singing along. Like a few other Siskind devotees, Bob Boilen had never heard of the Nashville singer-songwriter until her album Say It Louder showed up on his desk a few months ago; when he put it on, he was instantly smitten with the song ""Falling Stars,"" which he played on All Songs Considered.

If you've never heard of Sarah Siskind, click the video link on this page, and you're likely to praise her as effusively as Bob and I do at every opportunity. It's no faint praise to suggest that Bon Iver's version of ""Lovin's for Fools"" can't quite live up to Siskind's original: Hers is so wrenching, so infused with wounded grace, that it's essentially untouchable. Her strong but vulnerable voice, her impeccable phrasing and her gently masterful guitar work make her an underexposed treasure.

In this charming Tiny Desk concert, Siskind performs two of the highlights from Say It Louder — ""Falling Stars"" and the title track — before closing with a requested ""Lovin's for Fools."" Each song finds her concocting a heady cocktail of tender beauty and winsome regret, while employing a voice that's at once honeyed and raw.",2022-10-24 15:31:41,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X1uocXxyQo,NORMAL,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6X1uocXxyQo/default.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6X1uocXxyQo/mqdefault.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6X1uocXxyQo/hqdefault.jpg,NPR Music,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A

Feb. 28, 2020 | Felix Contreras -- When I presented Cimafunk at the Alt.Latino SXSW showcase last year, it was easily one of the most dynamic performances I had seen in more than ten years of attending the annual music festival. I couldn't wait to get them behind the Tiny Desk so the band could strut its intoxicating mix of Afro-Cuban dance music and 1970s funk-and-soul from the US.

From the moment Cimafunk and his band start their feathery intro to ""Alabao,"" it's clear that something different is about to go down. Lead vocalist Cimafunk (Erik Rodríguez) has mastered the mash-up of Cuban soneos (vocal improvisations) and deep, soul-singing over music that I swear could have been played by any of the funk bands I saw back in the '70s.

With a sound that would feel right at home in either the famed Apollo Theater or the hottest dance clubs of Havana, this young Afro-Cuban and crew take it to a whole different level. For example, the very traditional guajira piano riff on ""Cocinarte"" transitions to a James Brown-styled funk groove so easily, it sounds like they were made from the same root. (They are, but that is another story.)

The band breaks things down into the funkiest of bolero-swing only to have it explode into another funk romp, powered by lead singer Cimafunk's reimagining of 1960s soul singer Otis Redding and Cuban icon Benny Moré.

I've seen the band in Austin, Washington, D.C. and even on their home base in Havana, Cuba and every time, their tune ""Me Voy"" raises the roof and wakes the dead, with a deep Afro-Cuban, funk-party groove. This time, they turned the Tiny Desk into the hippest Cuban dance spot on the East Coast.

The band is making converts every time they play for new fans and you'll see why in this video. It catches them doing what they do best: combining two propulsive dance and musical traditions into one, singular musical vision.

Feb. 26, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- I asked everyone to gather a little closer than usual around my desk for this one.

The voice of Indigo Sparke feels fearless, but at moments it comes at a whisper. I was first taken by this Australian singer on a random journey, listening to around 1300 songs for last year's SXSW music fest. Her song ""the day i drove the car around the block"" has a mundane title that made me smile, but lyrics that both cut hard and comfort. ""Take off all my clothes, kiss me where the bruises are,"" and later the refrain, ""Love is the drug, and you are in my blood now."" Indigo told the NPR crowd about the song's origins of trying to learn how to drive on the other side of the road while in Los Angeles, with a huge vehicle and a stick shift. She just gave up and wrote this tale of defeat and solace.

On her third song, a tune that was so new at the time of this performance it had no title (now it's called ""Burn""), she's joined on guitar by her partner, Adrianne Lenker of Big Thief. It all made for a most intimate and sincere expression of honest emotion and a beautiful day with friends in the office.

Feb. 24, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- Having seen Jenny Lewis' recent concert spectacle, with its Las Vegas sparkle — complete with a multi-level stage — I loved the contrast her Tiny Desk Concert provided.

Jenny arrived at NPR with just her acoustic guitar and bandmates Emily Elbert, who sang and played guitar, and Anna Butterss on upright bass and vocals. Stripped of all the glitz, it was the words that found their way to my heart. A consummate storyteller, going as far back to her days with her band Rilo Kiley, Jenny's words have comforted and inspired so many.

She sings two of her three Tiny Desk songs from her fourth solo record, On the Line. These are tough breakup songs, though she redirects all the pain into thoughtful fun. She even turned ""Rabbit Hole"" into an NPR sing-along and gave us all a Hot Pockets surprise. You'll have to watch for that one.

June 29, 2009 | Stephen Thompson 

The Omaha-based folk-pop duo Azure Ray was built around the tension between its two very different halves: the playful experimentation of Orenda Fink and the straight-to-the-heart melancholy of Maria Taylor. Ever since Azure Ray went on hiatus in 2004, Fink and Taylor have released solo records and side projects — Fink popped up as half of O+S earlier this year, while both have performed in Now It's Overhead and Bright Eyes — that play to their respective strengths. In the case of Taylor, that's meant three terrific albums (11:11, Lynn Teeter Flower and the new LadyLuck) that bleed wistful beauty.

Azure Ray just announced a short reunion tour, with an album on the way thereafter, so it's a good time to revel in the quiet, sweet sadness of Taylor's solo side. It's clear from this Tiny Desk Concert, recorded without amplification at the desk of All Songs Considered host Bob Boilen while Bob was on vacation, that Taylor has never made a go of it as a busker: In terms of volume, she's closer to Laura Gibson than Tom Jones. But hers is a wonderfully warm presence, and the setting brings out her songs' winsome essence.

This three-song set features a pair of highlights of LadyLuck — the title track and the first single, ""Time Lapse Lifeline"" — before closing with a devastating song from Lynn Teeter Flower. Given a spare acoustic reading, ""Clean Getaway"" closes the set on a tender, reflective note. Amplification wouldn't have done it justice.",2022-10-24 15:30:39,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dqqknz0ERg,NORMAL,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5dqqknz0ERg/default.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5dqqknz0ERg/mqdefault.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5dqqknz0ERg/hqdefault.jpg,NPR Music,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A

Feb. 21 | Abby O'Neill -- ""If you've never been to a Drumhedz show... ...we're gonna take you on a quick journey as if you're going through a record store,"" Chris Dave told the NPR Music offices at the top of his set, ""picking up different genres of music and putting it in your bag.""

Chris Dave is reasonably described as your favorite drummer's favorite drummer, or better yet, your favorite musician's favorite drummer. As a veteran session artist in the music industry, he's recorded and written with everyone from D'Angelo to Adele. The Houston native leads the Drumhedz behind a trap set, with his unorthodox, stacked crash cymbals and percussive toys.

The set snuck in with a serpentine flute line that any '70s heist flick would be proud to have. Sonic smash-cuts between the musical ideas whisk away the misconception you're in control of the ride you're about to take. Vocalist and new Drumhedz member, Aaron Camper gathered the audience with a quick invocation, putting his unique range and texture on full display.

Elzhi, formerly of Slum Village, Detroit's true-school hip-hop outfit, surprised the room with an unannounced cameo, reprising his rapid-fire cadence on ""Whatever"" and inciting the crowd to nod along as the Drumhedz segued into ""Tainted,"" Slum Village's turn-of-the-millennium jam.

On ""Clear View,"" Camper and the Drumhedz ushered in '60s psychedelia reminiscent of Jefferson Airplane's ""White Rabbit,"" as if interpreted by Curtis Mayfield. Atmospheric keys played by Daniel Crawford ran roughshod over the mix, while Chris Dave, with his gift for syncopation, fostered a musical space for his bandmates to shine.

The melodic journey ended with a praise-song of gratitude and love of family called ""Job Well Done."" It was clear that Chris Dave and the Drumhedz had done just that.

Feb. 21, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- Watching Elisapie perform, her intensity is undeniable. I feel it in her gaze, in her deep, soulful bellow. Elisapie is a Canadian singer and songwriter born in Salluit, on the northern tip of Quebec. Her lyrics, most often sung in her native Inuktitut as well as English and French, touch on her life as an adopted child and on meeting her biological mother. Now, as a mother herself, she sings about what it must have meant to her own mother to give up her child. Elisapie left her birth-village, Salluit, as a teenager and headed to Montreal, leaving her community and her sick mom. The songs she sings, here all come from her album, The Ballad of the Runaway Girl and deal with the consequences of her leaving.

The sounds in Elisapie's music have roots in older rock music — in fact, she was a vinyl-spinning DJ and found a connection with the music of Neil Young and Bob Dylan, musicians with a message. Her band is also outstanding, from the bass saxophone of Jason Sharp to the guitars and sounds of Joe Grass and Josh Toal. And take some time to watch and listen to the tasteful drumming of Evan Tighe. This is an extraordinary Tiny Desk from an artist with something meaningful to say.

Feb. 18, 2020 | Sidney Madden -- Almost without trying, Snoh Aalegra has an unforgettable presence. Strolling into NPR's music department on the day of her Tiny Desk Concert debut, the striking Iranian-Swedish singer donned Off-White Nike Dunks, baggy jeans, dewy skin and a sleek ponytail, carrying herself with the kind of camera-ready, cool-girl aura that silenced a mass of people waiting for her. Even with all that, the moment she started to sing is when the real beauty shone through.

Like a fragile candle flame in a pool of melting wax, the texture of Aalegra's voice mesmerizes without overpowering. The 32-year-old has spent years perfecting that balance. Drawing her musical cues from Brandy and Sade while racking up a list of collaborators such as Vince Staples, James Fauntleroy and, most recently Pharrell Williams, Aalegra always finds her groove in the unexpected pockets of emotion. Much of her latest album, 2019's -Ugh, those feels again, is an ode to the comfortability of love, one that's even more appreciated within the close confines of the Tiny Desk.

On this day in particular, Aalegra's tracks were stripped of their punchier, album-version kick drums and trap echoes. In their absence, it's Aalegra's delicate vocal runs and chemistry with her supporting singers that resonated most. ""I Want You Around"" and ""Whoa,"" which usually rest on a bed of glitchy, spiraling production, felt lighter thanks to the dreamy string section, and by the time she sang her concert closer, ""Find Someone Like You,"" the room was in full swoon. It's clear that at just 16 minutes, Aalegra and her crew knew how to create a memorable moment.

Nov. 30, 2009 | Stephen Thompson 

Sometimes, an idea is so perverse and bizarre that it needs to be carried out and followed to its logical end. So once we hatched the idea to bring long-haired, wild-eyed, keyboard-pounding, sublimely over-the-top party-rocker Andrew W.K. to perform an intimate concert at Bob Boilen's desk, there was no abandoning it. It simply had to happen.

We had a pretty good sense that Andrew W.K. himself would be game. If one characteristic has defined his unpredictable career, it's the sort of monomaniacal fearlessness that's led him to make one of the most sonically overdriven rock records of all time (2001's I Get Wet), tour with a string quartet, release an album of piano instrumentals (the new 55 Cadillac), produce a Lee ""Scratch"" Perry record, appear as a commentator on Fox News, travel the world as a motivational speaker, and host a children's show for The Cartoon Network in which kids build gigantic metal contraptions and then blow the holy hell out of them. (That show's title would make a perfect Andrew W.K. song: Destroy Build Destroy.) Naturally, when we approached him with the Tiny Desk Concert challenge, he didn't shy away.

But then, as the date approached, people around the office kept asking me the same question: ""So, uh, what is Andrew W.K. going to do, anyway?"" His music, after all, doesn't lend itself to intimacy of any kind, and he'd be appearing by himself. I was in charge of bringing him in and setting up the show, so it was only fair that I should have some idea of what on earth was going to happen when he got here, but all I knew was that he needed a keyboard on site. The thing is, though, I didn't want to know. If it was going to be awkward and confusing and a little raw, so much the better: What's rock 'n' roll without an element of surprise?

What we got was... awkward, confusing and a little raw; so much the better. Andrew W.K. opened with two long improvisational piano pieces, performed a heavily reworked version of ""I Get Wet,"" and closed with a thoroughly unexpected cover of Jimmy Webb's ""The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress"" (popularized by Judy Collins, Joe Cocker, Linda Ronstadt and others). And there it is: in all likelihood, the first time Andrew W.K. and Linda Ronstadt have ever appeared in a sentence together. Now, that's rock 'n' roll.",2022-10-24 15:35:30,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k7_B07IyCA,NORMAL,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6k7_B07IyCA/default.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6k7_B07IyCA/mqdefault.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6k7_B07IyCA/hqdefault.jpg,NPR Music,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A

Feb. 14, 2020 | Stephen Thompson -- It was supposed to be so simple. Laura Stevenson, a singer-songwriter whose new material radiates warm intensity, would come in and knock us out with an intimate acoustic solo set performed behind Bob Boilen's desk. So I came to Bob with the idea, expecting a fast-track to the light-lift Laura Stevenson Tiny Desk concert of our dreams.

But Bob is nothing if not a pesky dreamer — a man who lives his life in pursuit of beauty and the creation of hard work for other people — so he suggested a wrinkle. What if we commissioned string arrangements for three songs from Stevenson's newest album, The Big Freeze?

So arranger Amy Domingues, who doubles as a marvelous D.C.-area cellist, dreamed up some charts and gathered a small ensemble (herself and violinists Shelley Matthews and Winston Yu) for accompaniment so gorgeous, Stevenson couldn't stop remarking on it between songs. When the singer hit the line in ""Living Room, NY"" about how ""It's a little stuffy in here,"" it was hard not to feel like the room had gotten a little dusty, too.

If the afternoon weren't already heartwarmingly swoony enough — Stevenson had brought a special guest to the set, performing while six months pregnant — we also got to witness what's almost definitely the first-ever Tiny Desk marriage proposal. Shortly after Stevenson's set had ended, Jonathan Zember got down on one knee as unobtrusively as possible and proposed to his girlfriend, Dena Rapoport; the two were attending the show as guests of an NPR staffer, and he figured it'd be a memorable spot for their big moment.

Chatting them up afterward, I told Jonathan that I'd appreciated how subtly he'd pulled off the ring reveal — quietly enough to give Dena the opportunity to say no if so inclined. She looked genuinely surprised by the suggestion and replied, ""Honestly, the thought never crossed my mind.""

Feb. 12, 2020 | Lars Gotrich -- Phil Elverum's songs come full circle, swooping down like vultures and floating up like ashes from flames. Throughout his work in Mount Eerie and The Microphones, idealism comes up against realism, existence entangles with impermanence and love discovers new forms. So when he sings, ""Let's get out the romance,"" in close harmony with Julie Doiron at the Tiny Desk, there's a history going back nearly two decades to an isolated cabin in Norway where he first wrote the phrase.

Lost Wisdom Pt. 2, released last year, is more than a continuation of a beloved collaboration; the sparsely decorated, deeply felt album meditates on a heart still breaking and mutating, but also gently reckons with a younger version of himself. That refrain on ""Belief"" — performed here with only an electric guitar and a nylon-string acoustic bought in Stockholm during that Scandinavian trip many years ago — not only references the cathartic singalong but also ""Flaming Home"" from 2008's Lost Wisdom.

Elverum remembers himself as a young man who begged ""the sky for some calamity to challenge my foundation."" We then become the Greek chorus, witness to the unfolding tragedy: first, the death of his wife and mother to their child, the musician and illustrator Geneviève Castrée, in 2016; then the marriage to actor Michelle Williams in 2018 and their divorce less than a year later. ""'The world always goes on,'"" Doiron sings in answer, quoting a Joanne Kyger poem, ""'Breaking us with its changes / Until our form, exhausted, runs true.'""

When ""Belief"" suddenly ends, seemingly in the middle of a thought, Elverum's eyes search the room. The audience responds with applause, but a version of this dynamic plays out everywhere he's performed for the last three years — long silences broken up by tentative claps, nervous laughs struck by grief and absurdity. The albums A Crow Looked At Me, Now Only and Lost Wisdom Pt. 2 engage Elverum and his fans in open wounds he chooses to share — death, love and the loss of love — and that we choose to listen to. Written with diaristic detail, but in awe of an endless horizon, Elverum's existentialism is exhausted, but seeking.

He smiles, says thanks, sighs and then sings once again.

Feb. 10, 2020 | Rodney Carmichael -- ""This is what real love sounds like.""

From any other new artist, a Tiny Desk declaration like that might sound a tad bit presumptuous if not altogether premature. But when the voice behind those words is as seasoned and vintage as Baby Rose's, everything it utters reverberates like the gospel truth. The D.C. native — who came of age in Fayetteville, N.C. before coming into her own as an artist in Atlanta — returned to her birthplace, backed by a big band including strings, to perform songs from her 2019 LP To Myself.

Studio debuts as stunning as To Myself don't come out every day, year or decade, for that matter. But to truly appreciate what Rose achieves on last year's release, you have to see her perform those songs live. In an era when the over-reliance on Autotune has nearly everybody in radio R&B land sounding like automatons, her unadulterated voice is almost otherworldly. It's confounding how a vocal tone so weathered and wise emerges from her so effortlessly. At 25, she mixes the bluesy melisma of Nina Simone and the deep register of Sarah Vaughan — two of her influences — with songwriting as devastating as her delivery.

""I would not be able to write with such emotion about these things without my fair share of regrets,"" she says, introducing her song ""Ragrets."" That kind of life experience seeps through in a performance plush with warmth and empathy. Dedicating the last song to herself — and ""to anyone here that's ever wanted to call or text somebody that you know you should not call or text"" — Rose introduced ""All To Myself"" by congratulating those of us who've refrained from squandering our emotions on the undeserved.

Funny enough, the last voice heard in Baby Rose's Tiny Desk belongs not to her but to her father, who arrived midway through her set before squeezing his way up to the front. ""That's my daughter!"" he shouts over the applause as Rose laughs and claps for him. The love was well-deserved.

Feb. 7, 2020 | Suraya Mohamed -- Here's a first: Steelpans at the Tiny Desk. It's true. Nearly a thousand performances into the series and the instrument has never been featured, until now. While the two bowls look shiny and new in this Jonathan Scales Fourchestra set, they were once authentic oil barrels, pounded, finished and tuned for bandleader, Jonathan Scales. But instrumentation and singularity aside, Scales' virtuosity, energy and connection to his bandmates wowed the NPR crowd, many of whom had never heard this music before.

Scales' musical hero, Béla Fleck, happened to be performing in the Washington, D.C. area on the same day as this performance, with just enough time to stop in for one song,""Focus Poem."" It's a cut Fleck originally played banjo on for the band's 2018 album Pillar. While the tune is a regular on the trio's setlist, this performance marks the first time they've played it live with Fleck. Scales later revealed that it was a little risky to open with such a technically complicated piece, but the execution was still superb.

Jonathan Scales Fourchestra has been performing for 13 years, now, redefining the steelpans as a signature jazz instrument. The first iteration of the band was a trio-plus-guitar, hence the ""four"" in the name. But when drummer Maison Guidry and bassist E'Lon JD joined Scales later, it was clear the trio's sound was complete. JD grounds the music with powerful bass lines, combined with guitar-like melodic and harmonic embellishments.

The other two songs in this set are also from Pillar. While it's not his most recent album, Scales calls it his most potent work to date, a quintessential representation of his music. ""We Came Through The Storm,"" with its heavy arrangement, is one of their most popular tunes, partly because of the dazzling drum riffs Guidry nails with playful proficiency. ""Fake Buddha's Inner Child"" closes the set on a sweet, softer note, showing the striking versatility of this band.

Feb. 5, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- There's intensity and clear intention to the music of Another Sky. I knew that from having seen this London band perform at SXSW. But in the confines of an office, hearing Catrin Vincent's unique voice, raw and un-amplified, brought it to another level. They came to NPR back in December to perform, opening their Tiny Desk set with a new song, released just this week. ""Brave Face"" is a window into the uncompromising sound and message of Another Sky, as Catrin sings in her impassioned voice:

""You must put yourself first
believe you will be loved 
only you can demand all you deserve 
You put on your brave face, now girl.""

This isn't a message that is easy to punctuate with music, but matching message with music is the strength of Another Sky. You can hear it in the way Jack Gilbert weaves his guitar lines around the haunting vocals, the way the rhythm section sets up a tension with the melody. On ""Avalanche,"" another song that deals with toxic masculinity, there's such ferocity, such commitment to the message.

During one moment between songs, Catrin brought some levity in the form of thanks. ""I used to work in an infamous thrift shop in London,"" she said, ""that paid me to sit and watch NPR Tiny Desks on loop, and I used to think, 'Oh we'll never get here,' and we did, so thank you.""

Another Sky is one of the few bands steeped in rock that, I find, uses this art form to convey meaningful, heartfelt beliefs, fueled with conviction and originality, without clichés.

SiR, the R&B singer from Inglewood, CA, seemed lost in thought as he stood behind the Tiny Desk. While his bandmates curiously bounced around the desk, joking and even searching for Bob Boilen, SiR remained particularly focused. About halfway through the performance, he eventually revealed what had been weighing on his heart. He told the NPR crowd he'd lost his infant godson a few days prior and dedicated the performance to him. ""We're doing this for him. It took a lot for me to be here today ...but we're gonna get through this.""

Since signing to hip-hop juggernaut Top Dawg Entertainment in 2017, Sir Darryl Farris been the most consistent, most reliable player on the roster outside of its original four (Jay Rock, Kendrick, Schoolboy Q and Ab-Soul.) His output has further solidified the label's stake in spaces outside of just rap music.

For his Tiny Desk concert, SiR treated the office to some of the best that his latest LP, Chasing Summer has to offer. Themes of regret loom throughout the album and he's never shied away from writing about personal flaws. His depiction of misdirected desires and heartbreak on ""John Redcorn"" and ""The Recipe"" reveal a cruel honesty that couples grapple with at times. The set was also a family affair with his mother and older brother offering support as two of the three background vocalists. We get a glimpse of his upbringing in the gospel choir once those harmonies open up.

Rising Appalachia's Tiny Desk Concert is charged with the roots music that sisters Leah Song and Chloe Smith learned in fiddle camps as kids. Growing up in urban Atlanta and beyond, they also heard rhythms from a wider world, and their music grew to reflect new sounds and their activism. When they came to NPR, their van was packed with a bodhrán (Irish drum), an ngoni (West African harp) a huge gourd, a cello, a baritone guitar and more, including the other musicians who make up this wandering, Atlanta-based band: David Brown, Biko Casini, Arouna Diarra and Duncan Wickel.

But American roots music sure seems to be the connecting tissue for this group. They end the set with a song Leah and Chloe ""learned from our mama, an old boot-stompin' Appalachian folk tune"" called ""Cuckoo,"" where the many worlds of American, Irish and African music and storytelling combine, and Rising Appalachia shines.

Jan. 29, 2020 | Lars Gotrich -- Jimmy Eat World showed up to the NPR Music office all smiles and no guitars, goofing off with toy instruments behind the Tiny Desk and cracking jokes. They borrowed a couple acoustics, a miniature gong and tambourine emblazoned with Bob Boilen's face, which set the tone for a slightly silly, but altogether gracious performance.

For 27 years, Jimmy Eat World has been the rock band with a bleeding, beating heart. Both its music and message have evolved in kind, from brokenhearted ballads to anthems of self-empowerment and the lessons of age. Joined by touring multi-instrumentalist Robin Vining and percussionist Zach Lind, Jim Adkins opens the stripped-down set with ""Love Never,"" a song about the hard work of sustaining love, which was originally released as a 7-inch in 2018. Adkins' and Vining's harmonies ring out brightly, and then Lind rings the gong.

""All The Way (Stay)"" comes from the band's tenth album, Surviving. Many of these new songs reflect older Jimmy Eat World themes: ""Your sense of self-worth coming from external validation is an empty pursuit,"" Jim Adkins tells the crowd. So as guitarist Tom Linton joins the band, they launch into ""The Middle."" Over time, this feel-good Bleed American single has remained a constant source of goodness in a sometimes bleak world. When the audience joins in for the last chorus, an uplifting catharsis streaked through our hearts as we all sang, ""Everything, everything will be just fine / Everything, everything will be all right, all right.""

Jan. 27, 2020 | Sidney Madden -- ""It's been a fairly short musical journey and we have seen fairly much success,"" Koffee told the NPR Music offices between songs during her Tiny Desk set. Flashing her braces with each grin, Jamaica's 19-year old tour de force wasn't exaggerating. Her debut EP, Rapture, just won a 2020 Grammy for Best Reggae Album, making her the first woman and the youngest artist to ever win in the category. It comes just two years after her tribute song to sprinter, eight-time Gold Medalist and fellow Jamaican Usain Bolt went viral online. Koffee has sustained a steady upwards momentum since then, finding her footing on festival stages and collaborating with others outside her genre. (Her latest single, ""W"" features Atlanta rapper, Gunna.)

Above all, what makes Koffee so refreshing is that she centers her music around faith, resilience and gratitude. She has a new perspective to add to the pantheon of mostly male reggae greats and it's resonating with a new generation that's just getting hip to the iconic sounds. As her Tiny Desk performance shows, Koffee makes the best of her surroundings, channeling the day's buzzy energy into a balancing act of youthful heart and old-pro precision, proving why she has become one of the most invigorating voices in reggae.

""I want to thank everybody who's been involved,"" Koffee told the crowd halfway during her show. ""You have now become a part of my journey.""

Jan. 24, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- J.S. Ondara's journey to the Tiny Desk is a fascinating one. From his home in Nairobi, he listened on his sister's radio to American artists, including Nirvana, Jeff Buckley, Death Cab For Cutie and, most importantly, Bob Dylan. He wanted to be a folk singer, so he moved to Minnesota, Dylan's home state.

At the Tiny Desk, after playing his song ""Lebanon,"" from his debut album Tales of America, J.S. Ondara told us his story. ""I remember, at one point, someone told me about this contest that you guys do called 'the Tiny Desk Contest.' And I was, at the time, desperately trying to be a folk singer. And I'm not quite. I'm not a big fan of contests, but I like NPR. So I figured I'd give it a shot. And I'd just written that song, 'Lebanon.' So I made a video of me playing that song, and I submitted it. And I suppose that things didn't go quite in my favor. So I figured I'd find a bit of a roundabout way to get here, which involved making a record and touring it relentlessly and stalking Bob [Boilen] all around South by Southwest. (I actually didn't do that part.) I was thinking about it. And now I'm here. The journey would have been a lot shorter had I just won the bloody contest. But in the very wise words of Miley Cyrus, 'it's not about how fast you get there, it's about the climb.'""

J.S. Ondara's music is sincere, with observations about America that are fresh and poetic. Here's how he compares the politics of our time, in his song, ""Days of Insanity:""

""There is a bear at the airport, waiting on a plane
There is a cow at the funeral, bidding farewell
There is a goat at the terminal, boarding the C-train
There is a horse at the hospital, dancing with the hare

""Somebody call the doctor, from the university
Somebody call upon the witch and the wizardry
Somebody call the rabbi, the pastor and the sheikh
Coz we are coming on the days of insanity
The days of insanity.""

And, now this Kenya-born singer is up for a Grammy award for Best Americana Album. Unbelievable, remarkable and well deserved.

Half way through this performance of Max Richter's achingly beautiful On The Nature Of Daylight, I looked around our NPR Music office and saw trembling chins and tearful eyes. Rarely have I seen so many Tiny Desk audience members moved in this way. There's something about Max Richter's music that triggers deep emotions.

In Daylight, which has been effectively used in movies such as Arrival and Shutter Island, a simple theme rolls out slowly in the low strings until a violin enters with a complimentary melody in a higher register. Richter, at the keyboard, adds a subterranean bass line for added gravitas, while high above another violin soars sweetly, mournfully. With all elements interlocked – and sensitively played by members of the American Contemporary Music Ensemble – the piece gently sways, building in intensity. It all adds up to a six-minute emotional journey that, if you open yourself to the sounds, can leave you wrung out.

""I'm very interested in the idea of a piece of music being a place to think,"" Richter explained, adding that he had written Daylight as a response to the 2003 Iraq War.

Richter, whose music can't be easily pigeonholed, lightened the mood with a miniature called Vladimir's Blues. Its delicately toggling chords are an homage to novelist Vladimir Nabokov who, in his spare time, was a respected lepidopterist, obsessed with a subfamily of gossamer-winged butterflies called the blues. Richter plays the piano with the practice pedal engaged for a warm, muted sound.

Again in the final piece, Richter counters violence with calming, thoughtful music. His ballet Infra is a meditation on the 2005 terrorist subway bombings in London. It's music about travel, too, Richter explains, saying that he was inspired by Schubert's melancholy song cycle Winterreise (Winter Journey).

In trying times, music by the soft-spoken Richter can feel like a safe haven, a place for personal reflection or a welcoming, utilitarian space to clear the mind.

Jan. 17, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- With her bouncy Afro and a big smile, Yola's presence behind the Tiny Desk was commanding, her energy captivating and, oh, that voice! I first saw Yola, then known as Yola Carter, in 2016 in Nashville, during AmericanaFest. Her soulful sound needed little amplification and, with her classic R&B swagger, I assumed her background was as a southern gospel singer, until she spoke. Her British accent was a shocker.

But Yola's affection for American music, from Dolly Parton to Aretha Franklin, is at the center of her character and expression. It's likely one of the reasons she chose to write and record her debut album, Walk Through Fire, at Dan Auerbach's Easy Eye Sound Studio in Nashville, and why it was such a perfect fit for her.

Now this singer from Bristol, who once sang for Massive Attack, and sampled by Iggy Azalea and The Chemical Brothers, is front-and-center and up for four Grammy awards in 2020, including Best New Artist. At this Tiny Desk Concert, you'll hear why.

Jan. 21, 2020 | Bobby Carter -- ""I was talking to J. Cole about me doing this,' Wale said as we rode the elevator up to the Tiny Desk. ""He told me to just do my thing, but I wish I had more time to work this set out."" Wale's friend and fellow MC was just one of several people who offered advice on how to approach his appearance for the Tiny Desk Fest. But I reminded him he's performed with a live band as much as any other rapper we've hosted, which seemed to put his mind at ease. Wale arrived eight hours before his scheduled set time and, after just minutes of rehearsal, quickly settled in and shook off any pre-show jitters.

More than 10 years ago, the man born Olubowale Victor Akintimehin generated a lot of buzz in the D.C. area with a host of mixtapes showcasing his MC skills over popular instrumentals. What separated him from the hundreds of other hopeful rappers trying to make names for themselves online was his ability to fuse go-go music — D.C.'s homegrown spin on funk — with hip-hop. (Well, that and a crazy mixtape tribute to Seinfeld.) In 2011, Wale joined forces with Rick Ross and his Maybach Music Group and had a real breakout with ""Lotus Flower Bomb,"" the lead single from his sophomore album, Ambition. It went on to earn him a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Song in 2013.

A native of the D.C., Maryland and Virginia area (or DMV), Wale's calling card remains the rap ballad, a streak he continued on his 2019 album, Wow... That's Crazy, which debuted at No. 7 on Billboard's Top 200. It reveals a man more self-aware than ever, exposing flaws and struggles while keeping his self confidence fully intact.

Wale's Tiny Desk concert opens with his very first hit record and ends with his latest. Sandwiched between are highlights from his catalogue with a special nod to his hometown sound, courtesy of his touring band, Tre And The Ppl (formerly UCB). Tre is Wale's right hand on stage and their effortless chemistry has been intact since the beginning.

Throughout 2019, Wale was pretty vocal on social media about the Tiny Desk. In September, he tweeted, ""Still never done tiny desk.. and it's like 20 min away..."". About a month later, on the same night Ward 5 Council member Kenyan McDuffie told the D.C. City Council go-go should be the official music of the district — and the night the Washington Nationals won the World Series — Wale finally made it.

Jan. 15, 2020 | Tom Huizenga -- When opera star Joyce DiDonato told us she wanted to sing centuries-old Italian love songs at the Tiny Desk we weren't surprised. But when she said she was bringing a jazz band to back her up, we did a double take. But that's Joyce, always taking risks. After all, the last time we filmed the down-to-earth diva, she insisted on singing an opera aria at the Stonewall Inn, the iconic gay tavern in Greenwich Village.

On paper, the idea of jazzing up old classical songs seems iffy. At the least it could come across as mannered and at worst, an anachronistic muddle. But DiDonato somehow makes it all sound indispensable, with her blend of rigor, wit and a sense of spontaneity.

The musical formula for these unorthodox arrangements makes room for typical jazz solos while DiDonato molds her phrases to the flexible rhythms and inserts old-school trills and flamboyant roulades.

Much of the credit goes to her crack band, especially trumpeter Charlie Porter with whom DiDonato trades riffs and raspy growls. Veteran bassist Chuck Israels, who keeps the music swinging hard, has played with everyone from Billie Holiday to the Kronos Quartet, and drummer Jason Haaheim's day job is principal timpanist of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra. Pianist Craig Terry, co-mastermind of the project, directs the young artist program at the Chicago Lyric Opera.

But the star of the show is the continually amazing DiDonato, whose voice is certainly one of the great wonders of her generation. The flexibility of the instrument, the colors she conjures and her fine-tuned dynamic range are a few of the reasons she's still at the peak of her powers. She looks and sounds like she's having the time of her life.

""It's such a rush to be here,"" DiDonato said to the appreciative audience of NPR staffers. Believe me, Joyce, the rush was all ours.

Jan. 13, 2020 | Suraya Mohamed -- Sometimes, things don't go smoothly at the Tiny Desk. After traveling all night, the soulful R&B artist Jordan Rakei and his band pulled up to NPR in their tour bus at the crack of dawn, only to find the Fender Rhodes we'd rented for him didn't have the right action. But after quickly ordering a replacement (that arrived moments before the Tiny Desk performance started), Rakei and his band locked-in and played a phenomenal set.

The band opened with ""Say Something,"" from the group's 2019 album, Origin. It's a song that encourages people to take action and speak up for themselves. They followed with ""Mind's Eye,"" a commentary on technology that questions whether advancements are always a good idea. After playing ""Talk To Me,"" from the group's 2016 debut album, Cloak, they returned to their most recent release to close with ""Speak,"" a reflective song with a beautiful solo piano accompaniment. Inspired by the TV show and book The Handmaid's Tale, it imagines a world where nuclear war has left half the women infertile, as technology runs amok.

Despite the sometimes dystopian themes in his music, Rakei's sound is easygoing and colorful. While steady grooves connect his singular blend of jazz and R&B, his tight chord voicings, compelling rhythms and mesmerizing vocals make for a wonderful performance.

Jan. 10, 2020 | Felix Contreras -- There must be something in the water down in Austin, Texas, because as soon as Brownout started playing behind the Tiny Desk, it was pretty obvious that a deep musicality is just a fact of life for Austin bands.

The slow groove of the opening song, ""Somewhere To Go,"" is punctuated by an old-school R&B horn section that's deceptively simple and emblematic of the power of their concept and spirit. The intricate interplay of the baritone sax, guitar, bongos and drums launch the second cut, ""Nain,"" into another down-tempo burner, with lyrics in Spanish about being different and not fitting in and seeing that as a positive. The band closed with ""You Don't Have To Fall,"" leaning into old-school Tower of Power horns that made quite a few heads dip and hips shake in our corner of the NPR building, highlighted by guitarist Beto Martinez's solo.

One of the things you need to know about this band is that they can change traditions or genres almost on a dime. The core members dip into soul, Latin funk, a form of Peruvian cumbia called chicha, and funk covers of both Black Sabbath and Public Enemy. What each configuration has in common is the almost telepathic bond the band has developed after 15 years of working stages across the country. As you can see on the video, it's so infectious that Prince once used them for a while as a back-up band.

Like I said, there must be something in the water in Austin. Watch the video and see for yourself.

Jan. 8, 2019 | Tom Huizenga -- After the ferociously talented harpist Bridget Kibbey unpacked her 47-stringed instrument at our NPR Music offices, she proceeded to crush the stereotype of the genteel harp, plucked by angels. She proved that the instrument can be as tempestuous as a tango, as complex as a Bach fugue and sing as serenely as a church choir.

Kibbey is crazy for the harp. She first heard one at a country church amid the Northwest Ohio cornfields where she grew up. Now she's the go-to harpist for contemporary composers, some of whom who are writing pieces especially for her.

For this Tiny Desk set, she deploys her arresting technique to rework music both old and new. Her blistering arrangement of J.S. Bach's familiar Toccata and Fugue in D minor offers tightly interwoven voices, like gears in a clock, with melodies and rhythms that sparkle. Her steamy rendition of jazz great Paquito D'Rivera's Bandoneon, the Argentine tango, struts proudly. And, finally, she returns to Bach, to let the instrument sing variations on the aching chorale ""O Sacred Head, Now Wounded,"" from the St. Matthew Passion.

With an irrepressible musician like Bridget Kibbey, we're going to have to start re-thinking the harp.

Dec. 31, 2019 | Felix Contreras -- When the crew that is Spanglish Fly pulled in behind the Tiny Desk, the group's vibrant version of boogaloo raised the temperature in the NPR Music offices quite a bit. Whether displaying their party spirit or even the slow burn of social consciousness on the song ""Los Niños En La Frontera,"" this band plays from the heart and engages both the mind and body.

There is something absolutely infectious about combining the deep groove of an Afro Cuban tumbao bass line with a conga marcha, while the horns answer a call-and-response with the vocalists, all in a confined space. The horn ensemble work that drives ""Boogaloo Shoes"" is worthy of the song's title, a name taken from the classic dance form that drove East Coast teens crazy in the 1960s. The percussion immediately causes hips to sway.

All of this is just the tip of the iceberg that makes Spanglish Fly one of the true pioneers of the boogaloo revival scene happening on the East Coast. For about sixteen minutes, our little corner of the building was the hottest Latin dance club in D.C.

Dec. 20, 2019 | Felix Contreras -- It's impossible to not be drawn in by the visual specter of Balún. The band has refined their electronic roots with their turn toward self-discovery on beautifully crafted studio albums, and this set behind the Tiny Desk shows how expertly they deliver the same meticulous, artful music live.

Their mix of traditional instruments with electronics creates not just a sonic treat but also a visual feast, as our eyes dart from one instrument to the other, drawn in by a Puerto Rican cuatro and a makeshift drum set.

But I didn't expect to be greeted by a mysterious, eighth member who made an appearance at the start of ""El Espanto"" in the form of programmed solenoids that struck the bottoms of pots and pans to create a rhythmic intro to one of their brilliantly crafted songs, mixing the folkloric with the modern.

Balún is part of a vanguard of bands that is expanding the musical landscape of Puerto Rico and it is a treat to watch them up close as they create an actual bridge between the ancient and the modern, set against a rich tapestry of vocals that extoll the virtues and challenges facing their beloved island these days.

Much like an island in the ocean, this performance is just the tip of the magic this band offers. Hopefully you'll be pulled into their visual and musical attractions as much as they have for me.

Dec. 18, 2019 | Felix Contreras -- When Los Lobos gathered behind the Tiny Desk, it felt like they were cramped in the back room of a family Christmas party. ""The only thing missing today are the tamales!,"" I told my office mates while introducing the band, a reference to a Mexican-American Christmas meal staple. The vibe in the room was definitely familia, with the presence of many long-time fans as well as folks who came for the holiday cheer, Lobos style.

The band called up tunes from the Latin Holiday song book, straight from their recently released, first-ever Christmas album, Llegó Navidad, a bilingual collection of songs from across Latin America and the U.S.

They kicked it off with an obscure novelty hit that was once popular in Latino households in the southwest, ""¿Dónde Está Santa Claus?."" It was originally a lushly orchestrated affair that is now a ""lowrider oldie.""

The new album's title cut, ""Llegó Navidad,"" is actually a classic from the Fania Records catalog originally performed by the Puerto Rican composer and singer Ismael Rivera. Los Lobos retains its pan Latin callout to holiday celebrations across Latin America, set to a slow burning montuno groove.

The band adds a David Hidalgo and Louie Perez original to the Latin holiday songbook with ""Christmas and You,"" a plaintive ballad about desperate loss that we would easily call a carte vena (vein cutter). The great Mexican essayist Alma Guillermoprieto once wrote that it's not a real Mexican party ""until someone cries"" and this song does the trick.

The party ends by sending everyone home, dancing with ""It's Christmas Time In Texas,"" a song by the great Tex- Mex troubadour, Freddy Fender. It's a Los Lobos scorcher, complete with accordion and good times that would get even abuelita dancing.

Dec. 16, 2019 | Bobby Carter -- Many bands make considerable adjustments to their playing style in order for their sound to properly fill the Tiny Desk space. LA-based trio Moonchild, along with three background singers and a drummer, arrived promptly for their load-in time, unpacked their gear and were ready to go within minutes. Aside from being especially efficient, their natural musical instincts made for a custom fit in our corner.

Amber Navran, Max Bryk and Andris Mattson joined forces in 2012 at the University of Southern California and their debut album, Be Free soon followed. This year, they released their fourth album, Little Ghost, intricately meshing jazz, R&B and hip-hop sounds under Amber's subtle vocal feats.

For their set, they pulled out all the stops: flutes, flugelhorns, saxophones, keyboards, ukuleles and some the best harmonies I've heard in recent memory. From the moment Amber walked into the building and throughout the performance, she wore a smile on her face and expressed sincere gratitude for the Tiny Desk platform. She took advantage of the moment and amplified a cause near and dear to her heart. She asked us to ""spend our privilege"" and do more in the fight for people of color in the United States. They closed with a jam from 2017's Voyager.

Dec. 13, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- The Comet is Coming is a force of nature. The British trio's approach to the Tiny Desk was ferocious. Shabaka Hutchings, aka King Shabaka, blew his sax hard while his effects pedal added reverb, expanding not only his sound but altering the office and making it a little eerier.

The set began with a deep drone from keyboardist Dan Leavers, aka Danalogue. It kicked into full gear when he leaped into the air and, on descent, drummer Max Hallett, aka Betamax, whacked the snare drum, setting off a transformative 19-minute concert.

The Comet is Coming is the kind of instrumental jazz trio that takes music lovers out of their comfort zone and into a musical realm they may never have explored. There's familiarity in these screechy sax/synth/drum dialogues, with the same kind of fuel that fires up Led Zeppelin or Fugazi, for example. Only here, what The Comet is Coming lacks in words, it makes up for in Shabaka's reedy lyricism, along with electronic textures from Dan Leavers.

These songs are from the band's second album, Trust in the Lifeforce of the Deep Mystery. This is music for adventure, a thrill-ride that may cleanse your musical palette and alter your taste.

Dec. 11, 2019 | Robin Hilton -- For most of her performance at the Tiny Desk, Nataile Mering, the transfixing voice behind Weyes Blood, sang with her eyes closed, lost and blissed out in the gently sweeping sounds. She didn't say a word until just before the last song, when she smiled and thanked everyone for coming. But you could feel the warmth and beauty and yearning in what was a tranquil, stirring set.

Mering and the other members of Weyes Blood kept the mix simple and restrained — a strummed guitar, two-part harmonies, a brushed beat — but still managed to re-create the majesty and wonder of the band's latest release, Titanic Rising, one of 2019's loftiest and most layered albums. The group played three cuts from the record, opening with ""Andromeda,"" an astral ode to love, followed by the awestruck ""Wild Time"" and ""Picture Me Better,"" a heartbreaking remembrance of a friend who died by suicide while Mering was working on the album.

Much of Weyes Blood's sound and vibe is rooted in '70s folk-pop traditions, with mystical themes of rambling on to find meaning and purpose. Mering's flawless voice recalls Karen Carpenter (though Mering says she doesn't care much about The Carpenters) and her melodies and progressions channel Joni Mitchell as much as Harry Nilsson. For this performance, Mering wore an all-white suit, a popular style of the era, and played a vintage acoustic Guild she bought ""from an old folksinger who had lived in London in the '70s and played a lot."" But, Mering later wrote in an email, the woman ""played her last show, placed her guitar in the case and barely touched it until I bought it in 2016."" Much like the journey of that guitar, Weyes Blood's appearance at the Tiny Desk was a beautiful trip.

Dec. 9, 2019 | Sidney Madden -- From the moment Raveena Aurora stepped into NPR's Music Department and looked at the Tiny Desk for the first time, she was ready. The Queens, N.Y. singer-songwriter and her team showed up early (which rarely happens) to meticulously arrange her stage props of homemade mushrooms and flowers, in the already endearingly cluttered space. These extra touches were meant to make clear that this performance would be all about community and safe spaces.

""A lot of my music talks about growing out of these really traumatic experiences,"" Raveena told the audience once the cameras started rolling. ""And if you've ever gone through something similar that I talk about in my music, I just want you to know that in this space that we're in, you're extremely, extremely loved.""

As Raveena pulled her audience in with the 2018 fan-favorite single ""Honey,"" and dreamy standouts from her 2019 debut album, Lucid, a hush fell over the office. Though sweet and soft-spoken, she exudes the confidence and clarity of a seasoned vet. Beyond an astounding vocal ability — the rising star cultivated her range by growing up on Minnie Riperton, Sade and Asha Puthli, India's '70s disco queen — it's Raveena's precision and charisma that shines brightest within the close quarters of the desk. From a coordinated band rocking a melted creamsicle palette to surrounding themselves with Raveena's homemade decor, it's the genuine attention to detail that makes this performance so mesmerizing.

Dec. 6, 2019 | Abby O'Neill -- This Freddie Gibbs and Madlib Tiny Desk performance was a year in the making, largely because Madlib insisted on playing with El Michels Affair, a vintage funk and soul band based out of New York. But it was worth the wait. When pianist Marco Benevento opened with a delicate, almost jazzy run, it created the perfect opening — and juxtaposition — for hard-hitting emcee, Gibbs to jump in and ride the hell out of that beat.

From the moment they launched into ""Education,"" a cut off the latest MadGibbs project Bandana, it was obvious Gibbs has spent countless hours honing his style. Meanwhile, Madlib, an enigmatic and reclusive producer known for his analog head-nodders, brought along a small thunder tube and vintage electric bongos circa 1960. Just getting a chance to see him ignited excitement in the NPR crowd.

But the conclusive jam in this killer set was ""Freestyle S***,"" a track that drips with the smoothness of satin and swagger of the seventies. It and the rest of the set elevated the room for both longtime purists and new fans alike. But the way Gibbs emphatically showed his love for Madlib was just as beautiful to witness. There's little doubt about their deep admiration and appreciation for each other. It was hands down, for me, the best Tiny Desk of the year.

This Tiny Desk concert was part of Tiny Desk Fest, a four-night series of extended concerts performed in front of a live audience and streamed live on YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.

Dec. 5, 2019 | Rodney Carmichael -- The first time Raphael Saadiq played Tiny Desk, ""it was really a tiny desk.""

""And honestly we were kinda complaining about it,"" Saadiq laughs, recalling that performance in 2009, back when hosting intimate little concerts behind Bob Boilen's desk was still a fledgling idea at NPR Music. ""Like, we kinda didn't wanna do it,"" he admits in hindsight. It wasn't until the video-taped version of his set hit the Internet and began picking up views that the lightbulb went off for Saadiq, too. ""It's like probably the biggest streaming I ever had, so it's kinda good to be back — not kinda good; it's really good to be back.""

As he tells this story, exactly one decade later, Saadiq's return to a slightly bigger Tiny Desk — to close out NPR's live-streamed Tiny Desk Fest — coincides with the biggest record of his career. Named for one of three brothers who succumbed to addiction, Jimmy Lee is his most personal, most vulnerable, most fearless work yet, and it comes at a point, more than 30 years into his career, when Saadiq has nothing left to prove or lose.

This is the same man, after all, who lit the fuse for soul's popular revival as the lead for Tony! Toni! Tone!, at a time when black bands bordered near-extinction. Then he led an entire generation of artists to the well and made them drink. In addition to a solo discography that cakewalks backward through the latter half of 20th-century funk and soul, his production credits read like a score card of black music MVPs over the last 20 years (D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Mary J. Blige, Ledisi, John Legend, Solange). If he's made it look effortless, that's because, sometimes, it has been.

Take the time when he was walking around the East Village in New York one day out of the blue. ""I was like, let me see where can I get a joint from,"" as he recalls during our post-performance conversation. The thought led him to Electric Lady Studios, where D'Angelo had taken up residence while working on his second solo album. ""I rung the bell: 'Is D'Angelo here?' He opens the door. He's like, 'What's up!' I said, 'You got a joint?' 'Hell yeah I got a joint.' He's like, 'Can we do a song?' I'm like, 'Yeah, whatever....'""

Needless to say the two already had history together — they'd co-written and co-produced ""Lady,"" D'Angelo's biggest hit until that point — and they were about to make more: ""We walk in and we do ""Untitled [(How Does It Feel)""] in maybe like two hours,"" he says.

True to form, Saadiq is still a talent magnet. For his Tiny Desk Fest set — recorded on Halloween, which explains the costumed crowd — he's joined by rising soul singer and songwriter Lucky Daye, who released his Grammy-nominated debut album, Painted, and made his own Tiny Desk debut this year. Daye performs two songs from that album, in addition to backing Saadiq, who also brought along a sousaphone player for his Instant Vintage classic, ""Still Ray.""

His collaborative performance with Daye is yet another testament to Saadiq's widespread influence, which remains something of an open secret to those in the know. Meanwhile, Jimmy Lee continues to garner Saadiq the kind of attention typically reserved for newer artists. After a career spent contributing so much of his genius behind the scenes and painting over the dark spots in his past with bright, ecstatic strokes, his latest feat feels like a revelation.

""I'm really just shocked about my whole career,"" he says. ""People say Raphael Saadiq is the most slept-on artist. I think I slept on myself, too. I would read this all the time [and] go, 'Slept on? I'm slept on? Cause I ain't Kanye? Cause I ain't talking loud?' Naw, they know.""

Indeed, we always have.

This Tiny Desk concert was part of Tiny Desk Fest, a four-night series of extended concerts performed in front of a live audience and streamed live on YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.

Dec. 3, 2019 | Stephen Thompson -- ""I heard a big thing on NPR about the shrinking of the attention span and how now, with pop songs, everything has like six seconds before you gotta change it, because the kids swipe over,"" Sheryl Crow tells the crowd early in her Tiny Desk Fest concert. ""I'm just gonna tell you right now: We're dinosaurs. ... And while the kids are all writing fast food — which is super-cool 'cause it tastes great, super-filling — we're sort of still writing salmon. We're the songwriters that are here to tax your attention span.""

Twenty-five years ago this fall, Crow was in the midst of a massive career breakthrough: Her inescapable hit ""All I Wanna Do"" was entrenched in the Top 5 — it would later win the Grammy for Record of the Year — and her 1993 debut album, Tuesday Night Music Club, was well on its way to selling more than 7 million copies in the U.S. alone. The years since have been similarly kind. A heavily decorated but eternally approachable star, Crow has released 11 albums and won nine Grammys en route to her latest, a duets collection called Threads.

For NPR's Tiny Desk Fest, Crow and her crack band of rock-and-roll lifers performed a 35-minute set (including two unexpected encores) that featured new material from Threads and a handful of hits that have morphed over the years into pop standards. From the easygoing opening strains of ""All I Wanna Do"" to the rousing final notes of ""If It Makes You Happy,"" we were in some of the surest hands in the business.

This Tiny Desk concert was part of Tiny Desk Fest, a four-night series of extended concerts performed in front of a live audience and streamed live on YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.

Dec. 2, 2019 | Sidney Madden -- ""I'm gonna get real comfortable with y'all, so I'm need y'all to get real comfortable with me,"" Megan Thee Stallion told the excited Tiny Desk Fest crowd as soon as she assumed her position behind the desk. After promptly switching out her patent leather heels for some fuzzy Louis Vuitton slippers, she let the room know, ""Now, don't be scared to get ratchet.""

From there, the Houston rapper wasted no time demonstrating why she's a superstar in the making. Megan exuded irresistible charisma, cracking jokes with the crowd and rattling off explicit bars from her award-winning mixtape, Fever, for the live audience watching on YouTube and social media.

From ""Hot Girl Summer"" to the platinum-selling ""Cash S***,"" Hot Girl Meg's raunchy hits took on new life thanks to a live backing band, Brooklyn's Phony Ppl, who seamlessly blend jazz, R&B and hip-hop. Midway through the spirited set, Megan and Phony Ppl surprised the audience by premiering an unreleased collaboration, a bouncy banger titled ""F***** Around."" After the first verse/chorus, the adoring crowd was singing along as if they'd known the song for years.

It was the first time Megan performed with a live band in public, but then again, there's been a lot of firsts over the past year. This time last fall, Megan was rapping her heart out at local shows, balancing classes at Texas Southern University and occasionally dropping a fire freestyle video from a suburban cul-de-sac driveway. Since then, the brilliant and bodacious rapper ascended to major festival stages, became one of the most sought-after features on other stars' songs, and electrified late-night television audiences.

Though she's dubbed herself a stallion because of her tall and voluptuous frame (Meg stands 5 feet 10 inches without heels,) the 24-year-old rapper has proven herself to be a workhorse when it comes to consistency. Her viral 2019 freestyles shot her online exposure through the roof and whichever alter ego she chooses in the moment — Tina Snow, Hot Girl Meg, Stalli — she's maintained the spotlight all year thanks to a steady stream of new music, an engaging personality and her own viral social media campaign, Hot Girl Summer.

Though she's usually known for extensive twerking during her stage performances, at the Tiny Desk, Meg played up a different skill set: impeccable timing and lung capacity. ""Yall talk about Meg's knees but sis breath control is pretty impressive too,"" one viewer tweeted out during the live video stream.

Megan's lyrical content lies in subverting established sexual dynamics and no matter the level of raunch she deploys, empowering women remains the artist's manifesto. Co-signs from all across hip-hop, from Q-Tip to Nicki Minaj to Chance the Rapper, have only bolstered her appeal and validated her bars in the eyes of the genre's cultural gatekeepers.

Dec. 2, 2019 | Abby O'Neill -- Considering the state of global politics, there's never been a better time to get reacquainted with the righteousness of Black Uhuru. The iconic reggae band, whose name means ""Black Freedom"" in Swahili, is still going strong after more than 40 years, and they brought their much-needed songs of solidarity to the Tiny Desk. Fittingly, the set begins with ""Here Comes Black Uhuru,"" a telling and literal re-introduction to the group's legacy for audiences that may be unfamiliar with their extensive catalogue.

While most-known for their late-'70s and early-'80s classics — years defined by a game of musical chairs within the group as played by founding members and/or collaborators Michael Rose, Garth Dennis, Don Carlos, Sandra ""Puma"" Jones, Sly Dunbar, Robbie Shakespeare and even Junior Reid — this incarnation of Black Uhuru, with frontman and co-lead Andrew Bees, has been touring and recording since about 1997 or so, longer than any of the configurations that precede it. As The World Turns, an album that was mired in issues around its master recordings, was finally released in 2018 — six years after it was recorded — and earned a Grammy nomination for best reggae album. Its title track is the second song of this set, followed up by ""I See You,"" a love song led by Derrick ""Duckie"" Simpson, a co-founder and the only steady member of the group since its beginnings in the early '70s.

The most well-known song of the performance — ""What Is Life?"" — explores the hopelessness endemic to those who are economically and socially disadvantaged, and explores the complexities of the human experience — what life could be, versus what it is. Despite being written and recorded in 1984, you can probably recognize the endurance of its themes.

Dec 2, 2019 | Rodney Carmichael -- Very few artists get to return to the Tiny Desk, and fewer still return twice in the same year. But after contributing background vocals behind the desk for Dreamville artist Bas in early 2019, we invited Mereba back for a solo set that puts her eclectic, major-label debut The Jungle Is The Only Way Out into sharp focus.

""I'm so excited to be here with you guys,"" she said one song into a set that features the multi-instrumentalist alternating between keys and guitar. ""Wow. Dreams coming true.""

The stripped-down soundscape Mereba achieves live with her four-piece band is equally dreamlike here, drawing from influences as wide-ranging as the many places she's called home (Alabama, Philly, North Carolina, Atlanta, Ethiopia). As she pulls from genres as seemingly disparate as folk, rap and spoken word, her set reflects the years she spent perfecting her craft on live stages in Atlanta cafes and clubs, where she attracted the attention of the indie creative collective Spillage Village (EarthGang, J.I.D, 6lack) before joining them in 2014.

But it's under the main spotlight that Mereba shines best, with her gift for lyrical storytelling putting her centerstage where the devil himself couldn't cast doubt on her dreams.

Nov. 25, 2019 | Lyndsey McKenna and Marissa Lorusso -- From the moment Carly Rae Jepsen arrived at NPR HQ for her Tiny Desk concert, she brought an obvious sense of joy. Take, for example, her sound check: Working with her band of longtime collaborators, she seemed downright delighted, beaming at the musicians as she gave notes after each meticulous run-through. It's that attention to detail that's helped build her a devoted fanbase ready to make memes of her every move.

Her performance was a long time coming: In 2012, Jepsen's No. 1 hit ""Call Me Maybe"" was inescapable, and her 2015 album E-MO-TION made her a critical darling. An extremely high proportion of NPR employees also happen to be fans of the left-of-center pop star; despite the nonstop impeachment hearing coverage happening just down the hall, Jepsen commanded a considerable and captivated crowd at the Tiny Desk.

For the performance, Jepsen and her band played three songs from her latest album, Dedicated, modulating the album's sparkling pop-disco vibe to fit our sun-filled office. From the smiling swagger of ""Want You In My Room"" to the head-rush of a new crush on ""Now That I Found You,"" to ""The Sound,"" Jepsen and her band even shared a few laughs during the set — and the whole crowd left smiling a little bit bigger.

Nov. 22, 2019 | Tom Huizenga -- When Russian-born pianist Igor Levit dropped in to play Beethoven at the Tiny Desk, he admitted he was – even after four cups of coffee – ""still in my time zone change."" A little jet-lagged, he had flown in from Berlin the night before and hopped an early train from New York to Washington, D.C.

But Levit easily slipped into his Beethoven zone – a space he knows all too well. Levit, 32, has been playing the German composer's music for half his life. He recently released a box set of all 32 Beethoven piano sonatas and once again he'll be performing complete cycles of the sonatas in various cities to mark the 250th anniversary of Beethoven's birth in 2020.

Levit's set placed the oddball, wryly-humored Andante from the neglected Tenth Sonata between two of the most famous pieces of western music: the opening movement of Beethoven's ""Moonlight"" Sonata and the tender, ubiquitous, bagatelle better known as ""Für Elise.""

Levit's ""Moonlight"" emphasized the mesmerizing qualities in the music, with its oscillating pulse, smoldering low end and tolling bells. The second piece proved Beethoven wasn't always the grumpy guy he's made out to be. His sly sense of humor percolates through the set of variations in a jaunty march rhythm, punctuated with a final, ironic, thundering chord. Levit closed with the ever popular ""Für Elise."" Sure, it's a ""total eye-roller,"" Levit admits, but he also describes it as ""one of the most beautiful treasures in the piano literature.""

Here we see three distinct sides of Beethoven – foreboding, funny and fetching – from one of his most ardent and thoughtful advocates. Now what could be better than that as an overture to the big Beethoven year ahead?

SET LIST
Beethoven: ""Piano Sonata No. 14 'Moonlight,' I. Adagio sostenuto""
Beethoven: ""Piano Sonata No. 10, II. Andante""
Beethoven: ""Bagatelle in A minor, 'Fur Elise'""

Nov. 20, 2019 | Colin Marshall -- Seconds before we hit record, Snarky Puppy's bandleader, Michael League leaned in to ask if he could ""do a little crowd work."" I suspect he waited until the last second on purpose, but it's been easy to trust this band when they have an idea, judging by the three Grammy Awards they get to dust off at home after every tour run.

What resulted was a Tiny Desk first: League divided the audience into two sections, one side clapping out a 3/4 beat and the other half a 4/4 beat, creating a polyrhythm that I'm sure a handful of coworkers didn't feel so confident trying to pull off. But this band pulls you in with simple instruction and a little faith.

Snarky Puppy has been a force for a while now, earning the ears of millions for more than a decade. And their secret sauce? A long-simmered recipe of jazz, funk and gospel. The band started as college friends in the jazz program at the University of North Texas back in 2003. But the formative era came a few years later, after League became a part of the gospel scene in Dallas and eventually brought the jazz students to church, where music plays a different role than it does in the classroom. In the pulpit, it's a channel for spiritual healing, a communal experience between players and congregation. As an experiment, League pulled his jazz friends and his gospel bandmates into one ensemble, where the two groups bonded together and established ground-zero for building the sonic identity of Snarky Puppy.

Thirteen albums later, you can still hear these gospel and jazz orbits crashing into each other. They're masters of theme and variation, offering anyone with a listening ear a place to grab hold. And people do. They're a band whose lyric-less melodies are still yelled (sung back) to them at their concerts around the world, as a shared catharsis for everyone in the room.

Nov. 13, 2019 | Suraya Mohamed -- Leslie Odom Jr. walked through the door with unassuming confidence and a big smile that brightened the room. Later, during his Tiny Desk performance, he recalled advice he'd received from a friend: ""You have to get used to it — you are part of a cultural phenomenon in New York City,"" Odom said, before quipping, ""I feel so blessed to be a part of Law & Order: SVU for three magnificent seasons.""

A Tony- and Grammy-winning star, Odom has added a slew of achievements to his portfolio since 2016, when he left his role playing Aaron Burr in Broadway's Hamilton. He's continued his work in television and film, written a book and released jazz and Christmas albums. He co-wrote most of the songs on his latest project, Mr; out earlier this month, it's his first album of original material.

While Mr features a range of genres, Odom brought three R&B songs to the desk. The first, ""Cold,"" is a hopeful ballad with a beautiful melody and a hint of contemporary musical theater. ""Foggy,"" which he describes as the album's most personal piece, is a love song filled with the regret of failed good intentions. Odom calls his set-closer, ""Hummingbird,"" an ""odd little bop,"" but really it's a happy song that's light and fun — it's his 2-year-old daughter's favorite.

A love of music runs through Odom's family. His wife, Nicolette Robinson, is one of the background singers here, and this isn't the first time the two have worked together. In 2018, they dropped a single called ""What Are We Waiting For."" Another notable performer here, Theron ""Neff-U"" Feemster, plays keys, piano and xylophone. One of the record's co-producers and co-writers, Feemster is a well-respected songwriter, producer and composer who's worked mostly in R&B for almost two decades. After working together on Mr for the last two years, Odom joked, ""I'm sure he's so ready for me to be out of his studio. It's taken us longer than we expected, but we're so proud of it.""

Nov. 8, 2019 | Rodney Carmichael -- Rather than squeezing in a stop by NPR's Washington D.C. headquarters between tour stops, the rapper Dave made a special trip all the way from the UK just for his Tiny Desk performance. If that isn't proof that it was a big deal, his nervousness before the show confirmed it. But he powered through in a performance that puts his gift for making the personal political on full display.

Behind Dave's British stoicism, you get an up-close look at the honest storytelling and stripped-down vulnerability that earned him a Mercury Prize in the UK for Psychodrama and an acting role in Netflix's crime drama reboot Top Boy. He blacks out, lyrically, with a four-piece band and background singer backing him after sharing the inspiration behind the aptly-titled song ""Black"" from his opus of a debut. ""It's just about the black British experience,"" he says. ""Everyone's experience of being black is a little bit different, but this is my take on it. I wanted to deliver it to the world and here it is for you guys.""

But the climax here comes near the end, when Dave takes a seat at the piano to accompany himself while rapping his 2018 hit, ""Hangman."" In the moment before he plays the opening keys, he pauses to take a breath before channeling the weight of the world through his fingers.

Oct. 25, 2019 | Felix Contreras -- For just about fifteen minutes, the members of Rio Mira created a living and very melodic connection to Africa. Set behind a large marimba — and drums that are unique to their corner of the world — the members of the band performed music that is the legacy of enslaved people who were in both Ecuador and Colombia. Rio Mira takes its name from a river that separates Ecuador and Colombia and empties into the Pacific Ocean.

Rio Mira's three songs in this performance are dominated by the marimba and accompanied by drums from both Europe and Africa. ""La Pepa de Tangaré"" references the culinary joys of life and, like the rest of their set, celebrates life along the river: soft breezes, loving friends, the embrace of Africa and, of course, lots of festejando (partying)!

If you're a little rusty on your college Spanish classes, the extended narration in ""Román Román"" tells the tale of a village man who has healing powers and challenges death.

For me, the principal attractions to this group are the instruments and the musical skills that were handed down for generations along the river, and how they eventually ended up here on this video for you to enjoy. I dare you to not move your hips along with these infectious grooves!

Oct. 21, 2019 | Felix Contreras -- Something happens for me when I hear jazz mixing it up with Brazilian rhythms. In the right hands it falls into the realm of magic.

Pianist, multi-instrumentalist and composer Jovino Santos Neto certainly cast a spell over those who gathered for this joyful turn behind the Tiny Desk.

His trio rushed right out of the gate with the samba-influenced ""Pantopé"" that introduces the concept of the trio: seamless interaction between the musicians that make the band sound like one big, melodic rhythm machine.

""Sempre Sim"" starts with percussionist Jeff Busch riffing on the traditional percussion instrument called berimbau, its ethereal sound creating the perfect intro to the dreamy melody and solo from Santos Neto on piano, while bassist Tim Carey echoes the double beat on the bass drum that drives Brazilian music.

Santos Neto says Erê represents the spirits of children in the Brazilian Umbanda tradition, which makes ""festa de Erê"" an appropriate title for the intensely whimsical tune that weaves in and out of the different traditional rhythms performed by all three musicians.

Jovino Santos Neto played for many years with Hermeto Pascoal, widely considered to be Brazil's greatest living musician. Pascoal can play practically anything he lays his hands on and some of that must have rubbed off on Jovino Santos Neto. You can see it when he picks up his flute mid song, then eventually plays both piano and flute at the same time.

Like the sometimes frenetic engery of the music they play, Jovino Santos Neto and his trio are perfect examples of musicians who have so much music coming from within, sometimes one instrument is just not enough.

Oct. 15, 2019 | Lyndsey McKenna -- As Taylor Swift settled in for her Tiny Desk, she looked out at the 300-plus NPR employees and guests. ""Wow! This is a lot of people in a tiny office!"" she said. ""I love it!"" Then, after introducing herself, she explained her objective: ""I just decided to take this as an opportunity to show you guys how the songs sounded when I first wrote them.""

It should come as no surprise that someone who commands stadium stages could hold court in NPR Music's corner of our Washington, D.C., office — specifically, behind Bob Boilen's desk — but Swift was truly at home in stripped-down, solo-session mode. (""It's just me. There's no dancers, unfortunately,"" she quipped.)

Opening with an acoustic rendition of ""The Man,"" from her 2019 album, Lover, Swift delivered a critique of gender double standards with a sense of humor (and a perfectly deployed hair toss), Leonardo DiCaprio name check and all. Turning to the piano with a smile for Lover's title track, she explained the guitar-string scars of the song's bridge. Picking up the guitar again for ""Death by a Thousand Cuts,"" Swift confronted a question that she says has haunted her career: What will you ever do if you get happy? Across the song's run-on thoughts and relentless searching, Swift offered an answer: She'll continue to excel at crafting superb story-songs.

Though most Tiny Desk concerts stop at three songs, we couldn't turn down the chance to hear ""All Too Well"" from Swift's 2012 album, Red. Routinely cited by critics and fans alike as a favorite, the beloved track has become the stuff of Swiftie legends, striking in its specificity (that scarf!) and relatable in a way that anyone who has loved and lost can understand.

That sense of connection is at the heart of it all. Some 800 Tiny Desk concerts since we published our very first back in April 2008, the aim remains the same: In the midst of meetings and conference calls, Tiny Desk concerts offer respite from the workday and opportunities to see artists reimagine their work in a strange setting. It's always special, but on some days, it feels downright magical. Watching Taylor Swift perform — and then interact with co-workers and guests who have grown up with her — was simply enchanting.

Oct. 21, 2019 | Rodney Carmichael -- Seconds before the cameras started to roll, Summer Walker showed just how much she was willing to sacrifice for her day at the Tiny Desk: She clipped her nails. It wasn't an aesthetic choice but a pragmatic one. Not even her love for a fresh set of bedazzled acrylics would get in the way of her strumming the soul out of her six-string Fender electric. The guitar wasn't the only thing she'd brought with her from Atlanta. In her lap sat ""Friend,"" the pink stuffed animal who no doubt provided a bit of emotional support during a five-song set that forced the shy enigma out of her creative shell.

""Look, I'm really freaking excited to be here but I have social anxiety like a mother******,"" Walker told the NPR crowd at the end of her set, barely mumbling the expletive in an attempt to censor herself. ""I'm freaked the hell out, I'm sweating, but this is so exciting for me.""

A 23-year old singer-songwriter with an uncensored pen and brown-liquor vocals, Walker has become something of a patron saint for colored girls who've considered bossing up when heartbreak is too much. With the release of her official studio debut Over It, she made history last week by racking up the biggest streaming week of any female R&B artist ever. Meanwhile, the first lady of upstart label Love Renaissance (LVRN) is lowkey leading a sonic revolution in Atlanta that's turning the trap capital back into an R&B town. Her team was equally insistent on tricking out the Tiny Desk space by hanging lights that brought a diffuse glow to Walker's creative set.

For an artist who rarely grants interviews and admittedly dreads the public spotlight — despite an Instagram feed that clearly shows off her humorous, exhibitionist flair — Walker's Tiny Desk is revealing. In the span of 15 minutes, she performs fan favorites (""Session 32,"" ""Wasted,"" ""Riot"") and the song that made Drake hop in her DMs, ""Girls Need Love,"" before ending with current single ""Playing Games."" Even behind the bright lights and oversized eyeglass frames, her unadorned soul shines through.

Oct. 15, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- From the moment Brittany Howard walked into the NPR offices, I could sense her intense commitment and passion. Her eight-piece backing band, all decked out in red and black, played with a soulful subtlety that bolstered Brittany Howard's tender songs about her family — stories of a mixed-race child growing up in Alabama.

All the songs performed at the Tiny Desk come from Jaime, an album Brittany Howard dedicated to her sister who died at the age of 13 from a rare form of eye cancer, the same disease that has left Brittany Howard partially blind in one eye. On these songs (and in particular at this Tiny Desk Concert), there is more nuance than I've heard in Brittany's past projects, including her work with Alabama Shakes and Thunderbitch. The music has a sense of wonder and playfulness, even when the subject is heavy, as in ""Georgia."" She tells the audience that it's a tale of ""a little young, black, gay girl having a crush on an older black girl and not knowing what to say and how I was feeling.""

Brittany Howard knows how to tell a story, to foster empathy and understanding and, in this intimate setting, the songs feel at home. The connection with the audience felt visceral as I looked around the room and into the eyes of my workmates and their friends. Even a small child in the arms of their parent screamed at the appropriate moment during the climax of Brittany's song, ""Baby."" It gave us all a good laugh just when the weight of the words felt the heaviest.

Oct. 9, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- Charly Bliss arrived at the Tiny Desk with roughly 20 gold balloons, a burst of energy and some glitter to match. The vibrancy, especially from singer Eva Hendricks, can feel childlike and candy-coated. On the other hand, the subject of these songs is more about the pain of entering adulthood and leaving some of that sweetness behind. The three songs performed at the Tiny Desk, all from the band's second album, Young Enough, are dark songs laced with the hope of bettering oneself.

While introducing the title track, Eva Hendricks tells the NPR crowd, ""It's been really incredible rearranging these songs for this [Tiny Desk Concert] because it makes you remember how you were feeling when you wrote it all. And this song is kind of about when you finally realize that you made it out to the other side of something really painful.""

Eva Hendricks wrote the lyrics to these songs. Her brother, Sam Hendricks — along with the other band members, Dan Shure and Spencer Fox — wrote the music. And to add texture and thrill to their sound, Charly Bliss added strings courtesy of Washington D.C.'s Rogue Collective. It all made for many moments of pure bliss.

Oct. 7, 2019 | Robin Hilton -- When Sharon Van Etten made her Tiny Desk debut back in the fall of 2010, her voice exuded fragile, gentle grace. Performing songs from that year's Epic, she huddled around a single acoustic guitar with backup singer Cat Martino to perform a set of tender and evocative folk-pop songs.

Cut to nearly a decade later. One of only a handful of artists to get a repeat headlining engagement at the Tiny Desk, Van Etten has spent the last few years purging her bucket list: She's become an actress (appearing as a guest star on The OA), released a string of increasingly aggressive albums (the latest of which is this year's synth-driven Remind Me Tomorrow), toured the world, performed on Twin Peaks, written music for films, become a mom, gone back to school and popped up in collaborations with everyone from Land of Talk to Jeff Goldblum.

So it's only natural that this Tiny Desk concert feels different; you can hear it before Van Etten and her band even show up onscreen. Its pace set by the ticking beat of a drum machine, ""Comeback Kid"" is in full bloom here, with a swaying arrangement that fills the room before Van Etten opens her mouth. Backed by a full band — including frequent Van Etten collaborator Heather Woods Broderick, who played the Tiny Desk as a member of Horse Feathers way back in 2009 — the singer performs with considerable intensity here, seething through ""You Shadow"" before punctuating the set-closing ""Seventeen"" with a scream that slashes through the office air.

Oct. 4, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- Molly Sarlé began her fascination with the multitude of objects shelved behind the Tiny Desk back when she sang with Mountain Man earlier this year. This time, with her own band, those objects left by others inspired a tale of a sweaty towel, an old lover and more.

At the heart of Molly Sarlé's songs are stories. Sometimes they feel like dreamy inner thoughts loosely connected. ""Human,"" her opening cut, is one of my very favorite songs of 2019. It may simply be a breakup song; but its wisdom is in recognizing our individual flaws, being OK with them and even finding pleasure in being imperfect beings.

I've been watching Ken Burns' Country Music documentary, and listening to Molly Sarlé sing here at the Tiny Desk — and then hearing the Carter Family in the documentary — I truly can imagine Molly as a soul from a century gone by. She's a captivating performer who sings as much with her eyes as she does her voice.

The songs Molly Sarlé performed at theTiny Desk are all from her debut solo album, Karaoke Angel. These songs aren't frivolous — they're thoughtful snapshots of life. Just before singing her final tune, ""Almost Free,"" Molly cleared her throat and said this song is ""about my dad wanting to talk to me about committing suicide — and it turns out writing a song about your dad talking to you about wanting to commit suicide is a great way to shift the conversation, because now we just talk about this song."" Molly Sarlé laughed a bit about the absurdity and truth of it all and, with what I sense as holding back a tear, sang a powerful, personal song in an awkward, open office space. It took hold of my emotions and thoughts as only a great songwriter and singer can and I'm grateful for that.

Sept. 30, 2019 | Bobby Carter -- The line of NPR staffers waiting to see the Jonas Brothers' Tiny Desk concert began forming four hours before the scheduled performance. Well aware of the actual start time, my colleagues sat patiently on the floor, working on their laptops with coffee in hand. By the time Kevin, Joe and Nick Jonas entered the building to chat with Michel Martin — and eventually make their way up to the Tiny Desk — the building was buzzing.

As the trio approached the desk, they were immediately drawn to the knickknacks and toy instruments scattered throughout the area. They ended up working them into their performance, adding a little childlike flair to three selections from their latest album, Happiness Begins, including ""Only Human"" and a jazzy rework of ""Sucker.""

It turns out the date of the performance was also Joe's birthday, so our video producer (and proud Joe-Bro fan), Morgan Noelle Smith brought a cake, and the large crowd serenaded him with ""Happy Birthday.""

The Jonas Brothers announced their reunion in February after a six-year hiatus and soon dropped a new single, ""Sucker,"" which debuted at number one of the Billboard Hot 100. It was the group's first number one. During their time apart, Kevin focused on family, Nick went solo and Joe formed the band DNCE. But watching their joyful and often playful set at the Tiny Desk, it was clear all the chemistry remains alive and well.

Sept. 27, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- Josh Ritter came to the Tiny Desk with the enthusiasm of a young child and the wisdom of an old soul. He arrived armed with a message and musical soulmates, Amanda Shires on fiddle and Jason Isbell on acoustic guitar. Both play on Josh's 2019 album Fever Breaks; in fact, Jason produced the record. This is Josh Ritter's second appearance at the Tiny Desk; his first was on Valentine's Day 2011. On this day, his heart was on America.

Each song was filled with frustrations regarding the treatment of refugees, immigration, politics and our hearts. On ""All Some Kind of Dream,"" he sings, ""There was a time when we were them / Just as now they all are we / Was there an hour when we took them in? / Or was it all some kind of dream?"" When the song ended, Josh stared into the NPR crowd. ""I feel like the big thing that we all have to fight against is this notion that we're not all human beings,"" he said. ""And they're trying to break us in every number of ways, all different little groups, and that we have no power, but we have power!""

Then he, Amanda and Jason launched into another Josh Ritter piece of passion, ""The Torch Committee,"" a song I believe is about evil and complacency. The trio ended with a new song, one I'd not heard before called ""The Gospel of Mary."" It imagines Joseph, Mary and their child as refugees. Honestly, it was a draining concert with challenges to who we are and who, as a country and a people, we wish to be. As the applause faded Josh hugged his bandmates, thanked the crowd, smiled and said, ""America, we love you, but you've gotta change!"" Music can do that, and Josh Ritter is an agent for that change.

Sept. 25, 2019 | Bobby Carter -- When Ari Lennox entered NPR Headquarters to perform at the Tiny Desk, we soon learned she was a little under the weather. Draped in a long, leopard-print coat, she greeted the band and approached the desk. I asked her if she was in any shape to sing, and she assured me she was. ""Oh, I'm fine and I'm ready!"" With that, she slipped off her coat, took her place behind the desk and began her warm up.

Earlier this Spring, Lennox staked her claim not only on J. Cole's Dreamville imprint as the sole female artist but also in the upper echelon of R&B with her debut album, Shea Butter Baby. Her nuanced but explicit — and sometimes lyrically graphic — approach to seemingly surface-level emotions and situations immediately struck a chord with fans, while slowly moving to the top of my favorite-albums list for 2019.

From the opening riffs of ""Speak to Me,"" her rich tone and vibrato drew the audience in, making the room feel small. The bonus in Ari Lennox's set is the glimpse you get of her bashful charm, which bought her much more leeway than a lot of us in the room expected. From the introduction of ""Pop"" to her NSFW call-and-response, to the song ""New Apartment,"" her personality beamed almost as bright as her voice. The D.C. native told NPR's Michel Martin that's she's always been slept-on. Those days may be in her rear view mirror after the year she's having.

Sept. 23, 2019 | Lauren Onkey -- Rosanne Cash and her band arrived at NPR to play the Tiny Desk on a freezing cold, bright sunny day in January — one of those brittle, crystal clear winter days when the snow reflects the sun and there's nowhere to hide from the light. Her intense performance had that same balance of heat and ice.

The songs that Cash performed at the desk, most taken from her 2018 album She Remembers Everything, have a lot of emotional heat, but they're shaped and sculpted by the wry wisdom of age and experience. More than at any time in her career, her spirit and approach to performance these days reflects the influence of her father, the legendary country singer Johnny Cash.

The audience was so focused on Cash and her band that it felt a little tense in the room until after the first song, the ominous ""She Remembers Everything."" Cash made a joke about the attentiveness of the ""NPR Listening Room"" and everyone relaxed. But the performance rewarded intense listening. John Leventhal's evocative guitar swirled around the haunting lyrics.

The band was as focused as the audience, which underscored the themes of memory and loss in the songs. Roseanne Cash has been making great records for forty years, but she's never played or written better music than she's doing right now.

Sept. 20, 2019 | Felix Contreras -- Luz Elena Mendoza has such a far-reaching creative spirit that it's almost impossible to confine her to a single musical identity. Which is why she's one of just a handful of artists who've been invited back to the Tiny Desk to offer a revised musical vision.

When she was here last with the band Y La Bamba, it was a vocal-heavy, folk outfit. The band's sound has always been about vocals and her music has become even more so over the years.

Now she's assembled a different crew with two electric guitars and keyboards that are layered underneath her passionate vocals. And for this turn behind the desk, having played together night after night results in a musical mind-meld that is heard in how the songs seamlessly morph from one to another.

Y La Bamba's albums are meticulously crafted sonic treats with her vocals layered like a choir made with a single voice. But in our offices, she called on vocalist Isabeau Waia'u Walker to replicate their distinct sound. ""Paloma Negra"" benefits from the voices of the entire band in a high-energy mediation on rhythm and voice.

There is a bruja energy and spirit to their performance, and not in the negative connotation that is the Spanish word for ""witch."" In Luz Elena Mendoza's hands a brujeria spirit is all about conjuring the kind of magic that took place on this video.

Sept. 18, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- There's a hush to the music of Nilüfer Yanya that made the Tiny Desk the perfect stage for her sound. On a hot summer day, the British singer and her band — made up of Jazzi Bobbi primarily on sax, Lucy Lu on bass, Ellis Dupuy on drums and Nilüfer on guitar and vocals — performed their three-song set with restraint and subtlety. At moments, the music felt like an eruption waiting to happen, though the suave, refined sound left an indelible vibe in the room.

The songs performed at the Tiny Desk all come from one of my top-10 albums of 2019, Miss Universe. It's an album of lovable pop songs awash in reverb but stark in tone, with Nilüfer's thickly accented, laid-back vocals and rich imagery at the forefront. Minus the production of the album, these songs are spare and spacious. The words lead the way as the ringing guitar tones embellish lines such as:

""Do you like pain? 
Again, again, again, again
Again, oh, again
Do you like pain?""

I don't know anyone who sings like Nilüfer, but I'm reminded of Astrud Gilberto singing bossa nova. There's a sophisticated sensibility rough enough around the edges that I find captivating.

Sept. 16, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- There is an intensity to Rhiannon Giddens I could feel from the moment she arrived at the Tiny Desk, and her songs reflect that spirit. ""Ten Thousand Voices,"" the first song in the set, was inspired by Rhiannon reading about the sub-Saharan slave trade. The follow-up piece was inspired by the American slave trade and a New England newspaper ad in the late 1700s of a young woman ""for sale"" and her 9-month old baby who was ""at the purchaser's option."" Rhiannon Giddens' thoughts of this young woman and how her life and her child were not under her control prompted the song ""At the Purchaser's Option.""

Despite its weightiness, Rhiannon Giddens' music is entertaining, and her voice, the melodies, and her accompaniment are engaging. But it is music infused with lessons and deep purpose — something all too rare in popular music in my opinion.

Three of the songs performed at the Tiny Desk are from her recent release, There Is No Other, recorded with her musical partner Francesco Turrisi. Francesco plays banjo, piano and frame drum here and is joined by Jason Sypher on upright bass. Rhiannon picks up a replica of an 1858 banjo for ""I'm On My Way,"" which she says helps her access her ancestors. ""So much beauty and so much horribleness wrapped up together seems to be our story,"" she says.

For her closing number, she focuses on the beauty. ""You can call it whatever you want, 'gravity,' 'God,' whatever. There's a force that I believe in, and that's what I focus on."" And with that the band takes us out on the beautiful gospel tune, ""He Will See You Through.""

Sept. 11, 2019 | Josh Rogosin -- Sixteen performers from the Broadway production of Come From Away recently climbed out of a chartered bus in front of NPR and crammed behind Bob Boilen's desk. They condensed their nearly two-hour show about the days following 9/11 into a relatively tiny 17 minutes. By the end of the diminutive set, there were more than a few tears shed.

Where were you on Sep. 11, 2001? Anyone who is old enough to remember can probably answer that question. Perhaps that's why the stories told in the Broadway musical Come From Away are so relatable.

In the aftermath of the Sep. 11 attacks, 38 planes carrying thousands of passengers were grounded in remote Gander, Newfoundland in Canada for five days. The creators of Come From Away traveled to Gander 10 years later and collected the tales that make up the musical.

In Gander there's an expression that, if you're visiting, you've ""come from away."" The people of Gander took in the come-from-aways, and their stories have resonated with audiences worldwide. The Broadway cast recently celebrated 1,000 performances and there are simultaneous productions running in London, Toronto, Melbourne and a national tour.

As one of the actors explains, ""The story we tell is not a 9/11 story, it's a 9/12 story. It's a story about the power of kindness in response to a terrible event, and how we can each live, leading with kindness, everyday.""

Sept. 9, 2019 | Felix Contreras -- There was a distinct feeling of history in the air when Damian ""Jr. Gong"" Marley took his place in our office with his band, and it wasn't just the legend behind his surname. For fifteen minutes, we were treated to the same socially relevant reggae that his father, legendary Jamaican reggae icon Bob Marley, made popular when he put the genre on the international music map.

With eyes shut, Marley dug deep into the healing power of music with songs from his 2017 album Stony Hill. ""So A Child May Follow"" addresses the troubles youth confront around the globe and how to persevere to succeed. ""Speak Life"" sums up the message of his music and his turn behind the Tiny Desk: live a life that will enable us to survive life's slings and arrows with dignity and love. But what makes his music stand out on this session is the prominence of the acoustic guitar and piano in the arrangements, which makes the familiar sound somewhat new.

And let's address the elephant in the room: Damian's father cast a giant, magnificent shadow on the world and it can't be easy to follow in those footsteps as a songwriter and musician. ""Jr. Gong"" (after his father's nickname of ""Tuff Gong"") seems to be undaunted by that legacy and instead draws on it for inspiration and guidance. Not to mention there is more than a hint of his father's unmistakable singing voice that so often preached the same messages of self-identity and self-determination that his youngest son is now doing so successfully.

Sept. 9, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- It's 10 years almost to the day since we published The Tallest Man On Earth's Tiny Desk in 2009. What I remember most about that performance was the intensity of Kristian Matsson and how astonished our audience was to discover him. I think of it as one of our very first viral videos. Tiny Desk Concerts were in their infancy in 2009; we had recorded only about 25 by the time he visited my desk. Now, almost 850 Tiny Desk Concerts later, The Tallest Man On Earth returns with a touch of grey and a beard, but still ever so slender and intense.

The Swedish singer now splits his time between Djurås, Sweden and Brooklyn, N.Y., and has just put out his fifth studio album titled, I Love You. It's a Fever Dream. I think Kristian Matsson's words are more focused, more observational and more appreciative of life than in the past. His new song, ""The Running Styles of New York,"" begins with, ""I hear beauty in things / Like the neighbors return / To their love and pride / Their day like a wicked ride / But then to belong.""

C.J. Camerieri joins him on French Horn and trumpet and those mournful sounds amplify these songs and their thoughtful intent. Hey, Kristian, want to come back in 2029?

Sept. 3, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- The last time we filmed these three Israeli sisters, they were sitting in my hotel room during South by Southwest, performing a heartbreaking lullaby, accompanied by just a guitarist. Now Liron, Tagel and Tair Haim are behind my desk with a full band of keyboards, bass, guitar and drums, singing more forlorn tunes in their unique three-part harmony.

Their songs mix Yemenite and Arabic traditions with splashes of reggae and hip-hop. Our Tiny Desk concert begins with ""Habib Galbi"" (""Love of My Heart""), a heartbreaking song that went viral for A-WA in 2016. A-WA have recently released a second album, Bayti Fi Rasi (My Home is in My Head). The record tells the story of their grandmother traveling from Yemen to Israel.

The final two songs come from that recent album. ""Al Asad"" is a metaphorical tale of facing down a lion in your path, while the last song ""Hana Mash Hu Al Yaman,"" (""Here is Not Yemen""), paints the struggles of coming to a new land, learning the language, finding work, a place to live and making it a home. This music is relatively upbeat with dark, thoughtful words. We've subtitled English translations as part of the video to help their message reach an even wider audience. This music is for our world at large.

Aug. 30, 2019 | Rodney Carmichael -- ""It's kinda hard to sing like that with the daylight out,"" The-Dream said after finishing the first number in a steamy set of songs more appropriate for the bedroom than the sunlit cubicles of NPR. Even more than the mega-hits he's written for the likes of Beyoncé (""Single Ladies"") and Rihanna (""Umbrella""), the self-styled radio killa's early solo oeuvre — known as the Love trio — helped cement the songwriter's saucy way with words.

It's a love language that finds The-Dream speaking directly to the streets, even as he aims to heat things up between the sheets. That metaphorical wink was on full display when he came to the Tiny Desk to share a couple of joints from his latest release, Ménage à Trois: Sextape Vol. 1, 2, 3.

""I know all the trappers, I know all the rappers / They who you see in the club and I'm who you love after,"" he sang in the opening verse of ""Bedroom."" Backed by keys, drums, bass and a three-piece horn section, The-Dream delivered his lyrics with that signature high-pitched whisper, just shy of a falsetto. Never one to be confused with a powerhouse vocalist, he's always been about setting the proper tone. ""I definitely wouldn't give Beyoncé a run for her money, at all. Not even on my best day,"" he told Frannie Kelley back in 2013. ""It's more emotion and feeling when it comes to me.""

R&B hasn't sounded the same since The-Dream changed the game. Maybe growing up off Bankhead on Atlanta's west side gifted him with a hip-hop swag native to the soil. Indeed, it's worth remembering that he preceded the current era of melodic, sing-songy rappers who disregard traditional lyricism for raw, heart-rending delivery. And long before young MCs became obsessed with stealing your girl, The-Dream was on that, too. So it was only right that he close his set with his infidelity classic, ""I Luv Your Girl"": ""Call it envy, I want her on me / All up in my head, now she in my bed.""

And all the shawties said, aye-aye, aye-yi-yi.

Aug. 29, 2019 | Colin Marshall -- Dan Tepfer has transformed the acoustic piano entirely with his new project, Natural Machines. Watch the keys and you'll see this Disklavier — a player piano — plucking notes on its own. But it's not a prerecorded script.

Here's how it works: Tepfer plays a note, and a computer program he authored reads those notes and tells the piano what to play in response. Tepfer can load different algorithms into the program that determine the pattern of playback, like one that returns the same note, only an octave higher. Another will play the inverted note based on the center of the piano keys. These rules create interesting restrictions that Tepfer says make room for thoughtful improvisation. In his words, he's not writing these songs, so much as writing the way they work. To better communicate what's happening between him and the piano, Tepfer converted these audio-impulse data into visualizations on the screen behind him, displaying in real time the notes he plays followed by the piano's feedback. We dive even deeper into this project in a recent Jazz Night in America video piece.

Perhaps the trickiest part here, unlike a human-to-human duo, is that the computer plays along with 100 percent accuracy based solely on Tepfer's moves. He compares it to dancing with a robot that never misses a beat. Tepfer has to play in kind to keep the train on the tracks, but if he falls out of step, so does the computer. On the other hand, Tepfer has unlocked a new frontier of music available to acoustic piano players: He's essentially given himself more limbs to play the piano at once, and at times we see more than 10 keys pressed at a time or a sequence of notes played at seemingly superhuman speeds. It's a central idea to what innovative technology enables for us — that which is impossible for us to achieve on our own.

Aug. 26, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- ""Is it ok if I do a little dance on your desk?"" asked 47SOUL singer and percussionist Walaa Sbeit on first seeing the Tiny Desk. I thought a minute, went under the desk, tightened the bolts, stuck some splints of wood under a few of the uneven legs and (feeling reassured) gave him the nod. It would be our first traditional Middle Eastern Dabke dancing atop the Tiny Desk and the first sounds of Shamstep (a kind of electronic dance music) behind it.

Shamstep is the creation of 47SOUL. At its heart is Arab roots music laced with dub, reggae and electronic dance music, including dubstep. It's positive-force music with freedom, celebration and hope for the people of the Sham region (Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria).

47SOUL's message of equality, heard here at the Tiny Desk (and on the group's current album, Balfron Promise) is meant for all the world. This is music without borders, mixing old and new, acoustic and electronic from a band formed in Amman Jordan, singing in Arabic and English. It's one big, positive and poignant party.

Aug. 23, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- Andrew Marlin and Emily Frantz made everything seem so easy, pulling a few acoustic instruments out of their car and, in no time, huddling around a single microphone behind the Tiny Desk. With that, Mandolin Orange was ready.

Emily bowed her fiddle while Andrew strummed a guitar and sang about his mom being carried away in a hearse. ""Golden Embers"" is the lead-off track to Mandolin Orange's 2019 album Tides of a Teardrop. This song shines a light on the darkness that fell on Andrew's family when he was 18.

Now ten years into playing together, this couple from Chapel Hill has a family of their own and recently released their sixth album. The two of them sing and play in such complementary ways; it's heartwarming to watch the ease with which they perform and harmonize. Their second song at the Tiny Desk, ""The Wolves,"" is a story song that, for me, tells a tale on an older woman's life, the ""hard road"" she's taken and that feeling of wanting to howl at the moon when all is finally right.

There is joy and thoughtfulness in the music of Mandolin Orange. The duo's set ends on the thoughtful side with ""Wildfire,"" a fan favorite from their 2016 album Blindfaller. It's a song with a wish that the Civil War would have left racism to rot on the battlefield, and yet it still rages like ""wildfire."" It's a sobering message presented with a gentle tone, a tone that instilled hope inside of me — hope that we may all learn the lessons of history and rise above them.

Aug 21, 2019 | Abby O'Neill -- Emerging artist Nicole Bus, who was born and raised in Amsterdam, had an immediate presence about her — a glow that radiated from all 6'1"" of her as she sauntered into the Tiny Desk area. She beamed a smile so infectious that her energy and aura were immediately felt. And this was before she graced us with her sultry voice.

Before launching into her performance, Nicole shared how meaningful this moment was and that playing at the tiny desk was a vision board aspiration she willfully manifested.

An ominous piano melody from keyboardist Eugene ""Man Man"" Roberts helped set an ever-evolving mood on the opening song, ""You,"" along with a seamless blend of horns and flute. Nicole followed by premiering a new song about women's empowerment, ""Love It,"" before closing with ""Mr. Big Shot,"" an up-tempo banger mixing high-energy rhythms with ragga-influenced vocals.

Nicole Bus' sound is nostalgic. It's reminiscent of vintage R&B, yet still feels current, and can transcend age and demographics.

Aug. 19, 2019 | Abby O'Neill -- Hailing from the southwest region of Houston and of Nigerian descent, Tobe Nwigwe made his Tiny Desk debut a family affair, with an entourage that included his seven-week old daughter. The baby was in the arms of Tobe's wife, Fat, known for her striking beauty and lead role in the magnificently directed music videos that have paved the way to Tobe's rapid growth on Instagram.

Baby Fat shared the stage with Tobe's exclusive producer and emcee, LaNell ""NELL"" Grant, band members and backup singers who, like soldiers in arms, performed a tight, orchestrated and musically rich set. If there were any doubters in the office, they were quickly won over.

Tobe's performance was a five-song medley sandwiched effortlessly into a 15-minute block. Launching with ""Houston Tribute,"" he used clever and evocative wordplay to rap about coming of age in the South. Accented almost hypnotically by a trio of harmonies provided by background vocalists Luke Whitney, David Michael Wyatt and Madeline Edwards, Tobe's mindful words are like a life hack for those seeking guidance. Throughout the set he offered pleas for listeners to look past inherent hardships and evil and to keep their eyes on the prize, while he reflected on his own decision to go against his Nigerian roots and parental expectations to pursue his dreams of being a rapper.

And through it all, young Baby Fat sat silently in her mom's arms, absorbing the spiritual energy of her dad's music.

Aug. 16, 2019 | Tom Huizenga -- It's not every day someone walks into our NPR Music offices and unpacks an instrument made in 1680. And yet Kian Soltani, the 27-year-old cellist who plays with the authority and poetry of someone twice his age, isn't exactly fazed by his rare Giovanni Grancino cello, which produces large, luminous tones. (He also plays a Stradivarius.)

And if you think the notion of a cello recital isn't exactly sexy or thrilling, just take a look at Soltani; he radiates joy and ingenuity as he performs three pieces that offer virtuosity, sweet lyricism and fire.

The Hungarian Rhapsody, by the late 19th century cellist and composer David Popper, traces its inspiration to similarly titled pieces by Franz Liszt and Johannes Brahms, but showcases a number of hot-dogging tricks for the cello, including stratospheric high notes, flamboyant slides and a specific high-velocity bouncing of the bow called sautillé. Soltani nails all of them with nonchalant elegance, backed with companionable accompaniment by pianist Christopher Schmitt.

To prove he can make his instrument truly sing, Soltani worked up his own arrangement of ""Nacht und Träume"" (Night and Dreams) by Franz Schubert, replacing the human voice with his cello's warm, intimate vocalizing. And in the Persian Fire Dance, Soltani's own composition, flavors from his Iranian roots – drones and spiky dance rhythms – commingle with percussive ornaments.

It all adds up to well-rounded, technically astute playing from a young cellist whose career is ascending in full flight.

Aug. 12, 2019 | Robin Hilton -- Well before arriving for this performance, the three guys in half•alive asked for the exact dimensions of the space behind Bob Boilen's desk. Known for their live shows, with elaborate, synchronized dancing and costume changes, the group naturally wondered how they'd pull everything off in such a cozy space.

Their solution? Have the dancers sit for the performance. The choreography, now restricted to the width of two chairs, was incredible. You'll see how it all works on the final song half•alive played, ""ice cold.,"" a new track from the band's just-released debut full-length, Now, Not Yet. And, if you're one of the 25-million people who've watched the band's must-see video for the song ""still feel,"" you'll likely recognize the dancers, Jordan Johnson and Aiden Carberry.

The band, fronted by singer and guitarist Josh Taylor, didn't try to squeeze in any costume changes. But in addition to the sitting dancers, they also brought along cellist Callie Galvez and violinist Emiko Bankson for a beautiful but propulsive version of the song ""RUNAWAY.""

Formed in Long Beach, Calif. in 2016, half•alive is a band with a clear vision and gift for design, not just in the earworms they write, but in their entire presentation, with often-matching outfits and carefully selected color schemes. It wasn't at all surprising to see and hear the care they took to make their Tiny Desk debut a memorable one.

Aug. 9, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- When Among Authors arrived at NPR, the Seattle band seemed like a pack of eager pups — and with good reason. The odds of this unsigned, self-managed quartet playing a Tiny Desk concert was pretty small, but Among Authors is a band that beats the odds. Nearly a dozen years ago, at 23, bandleader Ian Ketterer had open-heart surgery. Born without a thumb on his right hand and deaf in his right ear, he plays piano and sings. And, out of more than 6,000 entries to our 2018 Tiny Desk Contest, Among Authors was one of the most original bands I'd seen — so much so that we invited the group to perform as part of our Tiny Desk Contest tour in Seattle. I was even more impressed by Among Authors' songwriting and keen, spare musicianship at that KEXP-sponsored event, so I invited them to play a Tiny Desk concert. By the time their big day came, nearly a year later, they were ready — nervous, but ready.

Ian Ketterer sat behind our upright piano, partially hidden by his hair and hoodie. Patrick Brockwell's clean look provided a stark contrast, and his no-frills, perfectly placed rhythms matched his appearance. The two guitarists, Jon Livingston and Jason Ketterer (Ian's brother), played intertwining melodies, often lifting the songs from their dimness while embracing the mystery in the lyrics.

There's a clear sense of how deeply this band cares about its work. Among Authors' music isn't casual; there are songs within their songs, and they're not always catchy. They take you on a journey — one I'll continue to follow.

Aug. 7, 2019 | Colin Marshall -- Moments before the first note at the Tiny Desk, David Crosby needed the mics rearranged: He asked that his microphone be positioned evenly with the rest of his bandmates, rather than in front of them, explaining that while his name is the one on the marquee, The Lighthouse Band has no hierarchy.

That band is an inter-generational ensemble, featuring Snarky Puppy bandleader and bassist Michael League, as well as guitarist Becca Stevens and keyboardist Michelle Willis, both accomplished singers and songwriters in their own right. They all first came together while the members were collaboratively writing and recording for Crosby's 2016 album Lighthouse. Everybody sings in this band, trading lead vocals for harmonies and vice-versa in just about every combination.

If you follow him on Twitter, you know that Crosby hasn't abandoned the political poetics that once helped buttress the movement in the '60s and '70s, referencing the shifting cultural sands with lines like, ""It's time to turn the tide / Boys, sit back and let the other half drive."" Connecting the present to the past, the quartet also brought along a rearrangement of Joni Mitchell's ""Woodstock"" from a version Crosby recorded almost 50 years ago with Stephen Stills, Graham Nash and Neil Young on Déjà Vu. (It's also the final track on The Lighthouse Band's 2018 album, Here If You Listen.)

Aug. 2, 2019 | Felix Contreras -- When vocalist Ileana Cabra Joglar and her band visited the Tiny Desk, they'd just arrived from the front lines of the historic demonstrations taking place in Puerto Rico. Two days earlier, they were part of a crowd of tens of thousands who were on the streets calling for the resignation of embattled Gov. Ricardo Rosselló. (Rosselló recently stepped down, effective Friday.)

Right from the start, it was clear what was on iLe's mind in her song ""Curandera"" — ""I am a healer / I don't need candles to illuminate / I bring purifying water to cleanse / Removing pains so they never return"" — as congas and percussion shook the room with an Afro-Caribbean beat. The song is from the Calle 13 veteran's most recent album Almadura, which is filled with metaphors and allegories about the political, social and economic conditions in Puerto Rico. If there were any doubt as to her meaning, it was dispelled as she and the band transformed the passion and revolutionary spirit of the massive street demonstrations into a performance unlike many heard in our offices.

In the chorus of the slow-burning ""Contra Todo,"" iLe sings about channeling inner strengths and frustrations to win battles and remake the world. Her lyrics are rich with history, capturing the spirit of the streets of San Juan even as she stood, eyes closed, behind the Tiny Desk. Her entire performance is a startling reflection of this moment in Puerto Rican history.

By the time iLe and her band launched into ""Sin Masticar,"" they'd already captured the full power of protest, as their musical arrangements raged with the intensity of a crowd joined by a shared cause and pulse.

Aug. 8, 2019 | Bobby Carter -- Today, Aug. 8, marks the one-year anniversary of when NPR Music published the late Mac Miller's Tiny Desk. Last week, Ty Dolla $ign visited NPR headquarters to record a fantastic Tiny Desk concert of his own that will air in its entirety soon. But once we wrapped the taping, something special happened: I reminded Ty that he sat at the desk almost a year to the day that his friend, Mac, delivered what would be one of his final performances.

The band paused and huddled. They mulled over a few notes in a matter of seconds then gave me a signal that they were ready. The room was silenced and the cameras started rolling again.

Here's Ty performing a moving rendition of his 2016 collaboration with Mac, ""Cinderella"" from Mac's fourth studio album, The Divine Feminine. Ty's flanked by two close friends of Mac, Thundercat on bass and Justus West on guitar, both of whom played at the Tiny Desk with the Pittsburgh-born rapper a year ago.

Aug. 5, 2019 | Sidney Madden -- Back in January, Dreamville, one of rap's most formidable artist-run labels, invited a broad selection of hip-hop artists and creators to Atlanta to create the label's third compilation album, Revenge of the Dreamers III — and with Bas being one of Dreamville's most reliable wordsmiths, he was, naturally, part of that momentous camp.

But, as he was smack dab in the middle of recording his verses for ROTD3, the rapper had to hop on a plane to Washington D.C. — he had a performance date he just couldn't pass up.

""Let's get it!,"" Bas exclaimed, after walking straight off the plane and into his Tiny Desk concert. With only a brisk run-through with his band and back-up vocalist, Mereba, the Paris-born, Queens-bred MC delivered an energetic and comical set to an office full of fiends (Bas' endearing term for his fans, which doubles as a clothing line.)

""My new neighbor's mad cool. So shout out to Peggy,"" Bas joked mid-set, clarifying that the lyrics in his song ""Barack Obama Special,"" about hating his neighbors, were written in the past. ""Peggy be picking up my mail when I'm on tour.""

Just like his lyrically impressive and sometimes dance-inducing Tiny Desk — peep his headbanging and seated sambas throughout — Bas always balances his bravado with a relatable sense of humility. The songs performed provide a sample of his third studio album, Milky Way, a project that charts his story through the music industry thus far, taking stock of his strides and setbacks along with way. ""It's all in the timing / I had to get low, I had to get low,"" he sings on the chorus of ""Tribe.""

July 29, 2019 | Stephen Thompson -- Lots of musicians cut corners during sound check. It's a time to make sure everyone's in tune and in balance, everyone's blocked properly for the cameras, and every piece of recording equipment is doing its job the way it's supposed to, but it's not as if anyone's rolling tape for posterity. Sometimes, Tiny Desk artists do their sound check in shabby street clothes before ducking into the green room to don their fancy performance wear. It's standard procedure, and no big deal at all.

But from the second Lizzo entered the room, fresh off a long interview with Fresh Air's Terry Gross, she was on: all charm, vibrant and gracious, dressed to the nines and ready to sing her face off. In rehearsal, Lizzo belted out ""Cuz I Love You,"" the title track from her wonderful new album, with nothing off her fastball; if you were standing six feet away at the time, you'd swear the gale force of her voice was blowing your hair back. She was the star and the mayor rolled into one, at once ingratiating and commanding, as an audience of maybe 25 milled around and prepared to let in the crowd.

Once we opened the room, there were as many people as we've ever had at a Tiny Desk concert, hanging on Lizzo's every word as she held court and waited for the cameras to roll. She literally needed no introduction; one of us usually says a few words and gets the crowd to applaud for the start of the performance, but Lizzo was master of ceremonies from the second she walked in. Naturally, she needed all of two seconds to blow everyone's hair back once more.

Everything around the singer must have felt alien to her, starting with ""this tiny-ass desk"" and continuing through the crowd — perched mere feet away, with only a bit of office furniture and a few cameras as a barrier — and a backing band assembled, at Bob Boilen's request, just for the occasion. Lizzo usually performs with dancers and a backing track; the former, though much-missed here, stood in the crowd and bobbed along, while the latter got mothballed in favor of slyly funky arrangements. Together, Lizzo and that brand-new band preside over three songs from Cuz I Love You: the aforementioned title track, ""Truth Hurts"" (so winning, in spite of its repeated references to the Minnesota Vikings) and the literal and figurative show-stopper, ""Juice,"" which gave her the opportunity to pick up the flute she'd been waiting the whole set to bust out.

Aug 1, 2019 | Stephen Thompson -- Joey Burns and John Convertino had just about seen it all. Their band, Calexico, has been around for nearly a quarter-century, and in that time together they've churned out a long string of albums and collaborated with countless musicians on countless projects. But they'd never set foot behind the Tiny Desk until the day we recorded this performance.

By contrast, their pal Sam Beam — best known as the man behind Iron & Wine, with whom Calexico had just released a new album called Years to Burn — was already a Tiny Desk veteran. Beam recorded a solo set as Iron & Wine in 2011, then returned with singer-songwriter Jesca Hoop six years later, and he took great pains to gently tease the Calexico guys for taking so long. (""It's fun to be back,"" he noted between songs, adding, ""Isn't it, Joey?"")

Of course, ""taking so long"" is a part of this particular project's M.O. Calexico and Iron & Wine first made a record together back in 2005, when they released In the Reins, and took 14 years to release a follow-up. This set perfectly captures the easy patience of their interplay, as Burns, Convertino, Beam and a few of their most trusted collaborators performed two songs from Years to Burn. Then, as a reminder of the adage about good things coming to those who wait, they closed with ""He Lays in the Reins,"" for a Tiny Desk debut more than a decade in the making.

July 26, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- I was thrilled to have the gifted voice of Tamino gracing the Tiny Desk. But as charged as I was, that didn't match the excitement that Colin Greenwood expressed as we rode up the elevator. The Radiohead bassist (and bassist for this special performance) shared a brief text exchange with his son, basically telling his hugely accomplished dad that playing the Tiny Desk was ""the coolest thing he'd ever done!"" That made us all smile.

The attraction that brought Colin Greenwood and these other musicians to bond with Tamino, a young singer of Belgian, Egyptian, and Lebanese descent, is his voice; it's inescapable. For me a reference point is Jeff Buckley; they both have a way of soaring into the upper registers and into the ether; it's stunning. I first heard Tamino perform live at a convention center in Austin; he transformed and transcended the relatively soulless space.

The songs performed at the Tiny Desk by the 22-year-old singer come from both a 2018 EP titled Habibi and later that year an album titled Amir. His use of that falsetto had some faces in the NPR audience gasping in astonishment. There's a yearning in Tamino's songs that I don't often hear in popular music — he makes every vowel count. There's nothing casual about his expressions, whether he's singing about a sweetheart in the song ""Habibi"" or despair turned to joy in ""Indigo Night.""

Some of the inspiration for Tamino's approach comes from his heritage and in particular his grandfather Muharram Fouad, a well-known Egyptian singer known as ""The Sound of the Nile."" It was his late grandfather's old guitar that Tamino had first played. He got to know his grandfather's music through his cassettes. Tamino would later incorporate what he heard into his songs. It's ageless music that Tamino makes — it's melodies feel well worn, but it's also vibrant and intoxicating.

July 22, 2019 | Collin Marshall -- As the the NPR staff gathered to watch his performance, Jacob Collier sprinted full bore down the hallway. It seems the North London 24-year-old can hardly contain his creative energy. It comes out in his wardrobe and most definitely in his music, but it's not misdirected or out of control. These are intricate and precise compositions, like a ship in a bottle made of thousands of planks of wood, yet light enough to sail in a breeze. It's on a scale you wouldn't imagine. Here's an example: This year he covered Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer's ""Moon River"" by recording himself 5,000 times and working in 144 other vocal submissions, and then he printed and sold signed copies of his Logic Pro audio session for fans while on tour. Though this is is a regular day for Jacob, his output continues to astonish everyone around him, both in its quality and sheer quantity. This year alone, he's putting out a project called Djesse with four distinct and complete volumes. Many of the songs are being written along the way, including one crafted specifically for the Tiny Desk called ""It Don't Matter.""

The whole Tiny Desk Concert has a lot to unpack. Check my math, but by my count Jacob plays seven instruments, if you include his singing. And you should — Jacob's stamp has always been to use voice in his compositions like a Swiss army knife, and virtually every combination of band members harmonizes at some point in the show. It's reflective of his philosophy on music as a connecting tool, to use the instrument we all possess, which drew me to his art in the first place. And as if to make good on those beliefs and bring all of us into one moment, he invited the crowd to sing the final lyrics of the concert together. It was the end of the show, but not even close to the limit of Jacob's imaginative bounds. He obsessed over leaving us a gift: a fake ID fashioned out of a passport photo and an Oyster Card — London's public transit fare card — which now sits on the hallowed shelves of the Tiny Desk. Extra credit if you can spot it in future episodes.

July 23, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- We've been covering Priests, this fabulous, punk-infused art band, since 2013. I've seen them a lot (they're based here in D.C.). So the request of an upright piano was the last thing I expected when singer Katie Alice Greer and guitarist G.L. Jaguar talked about doing a Tiny Desk Concert. But we wheeled the Yamaha upright in place and they invited their accompanist Mary Voutsas to join bandmates Daniele Yandel and Alexandra Tyson. What we have is a kinder, gentler and starker version of this great band.

Priests played only songs from their personally groundbreaking, genre-stretching album The Seduction of Kansas, an album produced with the creative force of John Congleton. The lyrics for the album's title track are a gateway into their philosophy — how the personal is political. Katie sings, ""It's the last picture show, all the cowboys, they get ready / For a drawn-out, charismatic parody / Of what a country thought it used to be.""

I'm glad we waited a bit into this band's life to bring them to the Tiny Desk; they're at a creative peak and they brought it home.

July 24, 2019 | Sidney Madden -- Imagine for a moment if Cab Calloway, the Cotton Club's exuberant bandleader, was reincarnated in the 21st Century. Now imagine if he was dropped in the middle of the music world of today. He'd no doubt be a tall and slender, silky-wearing goof ball with a moisturized braid-out, instruments inscribed as knuckle tattoos and a penchant for genre-blending. Yes, the spirit of Cab lives on in Masego, the singer, producer and multi-instrumentalist who surprised NPR's Tiny Desk audience with a zany sense of showmanship and a demonstration of his own genre, TrapHouseJazz.

Masego's five-song set at the Desk wound up feeling something like a jam session — props and surprise guests included. First, before opening with the jazzy ""Tadow,"" Sego pulled off a quick, mini-prank by sending his friend, comedian Lorenzo Cromwell, up to the mic before stepping forth himself. Next, Sego tossed up 100 dollar bills with his face on it and beckoned the crowd into a call-and-response of ""hi-di-hi-di-hi-di-ho."" Finally, to have a few more moments of fun after ""I Do Everything"" — and to prove he really does do everything — Sego juggled water bottles to the rhythm of the luscious music his band providing.

Born in Jamaica and raised in Virginia, Masego grew up on gospel, jazz and hip-hop. With an appetite for all genres and an ambidextrous nature for learning music, the 26-year-old's been mixing all his influences up, traveling the world and collaborating with the likes of GoldLink, SiR and Ari Lennox. Where his sound takes him next is anyone's guess, but at the Tiny Desk, the multi-hyphenate found his sweet spot.

Lars Gotrich | July 12, 2019 -- Every time I've seen Erin Rae live, she transforms her quiet storms into different hues of squalling introspection. Her performance at the Tiny Desk opens with a soft tide of ambient tones — both a way to ease into the song but also understand that life's unease is ever-present. Then a lilting acoustic melody introduces ""Bad Mind,"" a stunning statement of identity from a Nashville singer-songwriter who shares the secrets we keep close.

Erin Rae writes songs about letting go of lovers and thoughts that weigh you down, embracing contentment and recognizing the small moments that add up to the grand scheme. But more importantly her songs make you just sit in your thoughts for a tick longer. Putting On Airs, the album Erin Rae released last year, wraps these subtle shifts of folkloric psychedelia in deeply personal songwriting that hits hard two, three listens in.

She's joined here by Jerry Bernhardt, a treasured collaborator and a guitarist who knows how to play decorative but unobtrusive figures. He and drummer Dom Billet both appear on Putting On Airs, taking those arrangements and stretching them out at the Tiny Desk with Mellotron/Rhodes piano player Ben Tanner and bassist Joe Garner. Inventive in these altered live versions, this Tiny Desk closes with ""the summer jam,"" as Erin Rae jokingly calls ""Love Like Before,"" offering another opportunity to reflect as you bop: ""Been looking for something I can't track down / Love that I knew before.""

July 10, 2019 | Josh Rogosin -- Sting and Shaggy might not be the most likely musical pairing. But one thing is certain, they love playing each other's music. On a bright autumn morning, the legends arrived at the NPR Music office bleary-eyed yet excited to play for the diverse staff of Shaggy and Sting fans. What surprised many of my NPR colleagues is just how well the collaboration works.

Their success as a duo shouldn't come as a total shock. After all, pulsing through many Police songs (Sting's famed band of the '70s and '80s) is a Reggae backbeat. It's impossible not to hear the influence in classics like ""Walking On The Moon"" and ""So Lonely.""

Shaggy (zoinks! - his nom de guerre comes from the Scooby-Doo cartoon character) was born in Kingston, Jamaica. He moved to New York when he was 18 and his music evokes only good vibes. The positive energy he brought to their opening song, ""Englishman [and Jamaican] In New York,"" had everyone in the room grinning ear to ear, ""early morning Reggae style,"" as he put it. After the tune, Sting announced ""I never sang that song before 8 PM... Ever!""

Sting's familiar, raspy voice was accompanied by his battered 1957 Fender Precision bass he's plucked for over 25 years. His long-time guitarist and collaborator, Dominic Miller, strummed Reggae offbeats on acoustic guitar and co-wrote the hauntingly beautiful ""Shape Of My Heart."" That song is mashed-up with Juice Wrld's ""Lucid Dream,"" sung by Gene Noble, offering a refreshing counter to Sting's nuanced melody.

Shaggy affectionately refers to his collaborator as ""Stingy,"" putting his arm around him mid-performance. It's easy to see the comradery that being on the road together affords these veteran musicians, to say nothing of the breath of fresh air they bring to each other's music.

July 8, 2019 | Lars Gotrich -- Who would've thought that American Football's fruitful reunion would include a children's choir at the Tiny Desk?

Twenty years after a self-titled debut that featured one heartbroken mixtape-worthy song after another, American Football is writing some of the best music of its career right now. Once an emo trio from Central Illinois, American Football brought its expanded band to the Tiny Desk, including a vibraphonist, backing singer and, yes, six children from a D.C. choir.

American Football's thoughtful and expansive return has yielded two self-titled records in just three years. This set culls from LP3, as it's colloquially known, as Pure Bathing Culture's Sarah Versprille steps in to sing backing vocals for ""Every Wave to Ever Rise"" and takes a verse on ""Uncomfortably Numb,"" whose recorded versions feature Land of Talk's Elizabeth Powell and Paramore's Hayley Williams. These spacious songs acts as revelatory meditations on what it means to grow older in love and relationships, with lovers and family.

For ""Heir Apparent,"" we reached out to members of the Children's Chorus of Washington to sing the coda's quiet mantra. When the 12-to-14-year olds asked frontman Mike Kinsella what the song meant, in order to capture the right emotion, he told them, in so many words, that it was a sad song, but that he'd like them to wear paper crowns while singing it. Just a touch of Kinsella irony, as he grinned ear-to-ear and they sang, ""Heir apparent to the throne / The king of all alone.""

SET LIST
""Every Wave To Ever Rise

July 5, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- Miya Folick began her Tiny Desk Concert with an apology in the form of a song. ""Thingamajig"" opens with Wynne Bennett's stark piano. The song is also the lead-off track on Miya Folick's 2018 album Premonitions. On that version, the song crescendos with strings backed by a vocal loop. Here at the Tiny Desk, we get to hear why Miya Folick is such an astonishing performer, her classically trained voice taking charge, wrapping around those melodic piano lines while singing, ""I am sorry / I know I am wrong / So take it all / I want to be out of control.""

Miya Folick was raised a Buddhist in Santa Ana, Calif., and is of Ukrainian and Japanese descent. She sings of conviction, not fiction. I find a stirring sense of truth driving that powerful voice of hers.

For her second tune at the Tiny Desk, ""Deadbody,"" she sings, ""I need you to know I'm not powerless / My strength lies within my gentleness."" And by the time the chorus kicks in, her little band of two is in full throttle while Miya sings, ""Over my dead body,"" addressing the cruelty of men toward women.

I could see a deep appreciation for this day in Miya's eyes. And before she played her final song, she took a moment to be thankful for being in this space. Miya stopped to say that she's been watching Tiny Desk Concerts since before she was even playing music. Then she tuned her guitar, took a deep breath and launched into the darkness for her final tune.

I've seen Miya Folick a lot since roughly 2015; this day was magic.

July 3, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- In the NPR parking garage, Gemma Doherty pulled her 34-string lever harp from the band's vehicle; it seemed bigger than all of us. The other instruments were less exotic — a few small synthesizers, a sampler, electronic drum pads — but I was feeling thrilled by what was about to unfold.

Saint Sister makes the sort of music I've been fascinated with for much of my life, music that mixes the organic with the electronic. In this case, the organic sounds come from that Dusty Strings harp and the harmonies of Gemma Doherty and Morgan Macintyre, with electronics performed on keyboards by Morgan and Dek Hynes, and the mostly digital drums of Shane Gough.

Some find this kind of joy in the pairing of wine and food, the way one element enhances the other. That blend is at the heart of my passion for Saint Sister. You can hear it in the chiming sounds of the Roland keyboard, the click of the drum and how it extends and enhances the sound of the harp. All the while Gemma and Morgan are singing about lost love, with lines like ""You on the blue carpet / We swapped bodies for a while / What was I doing all of those years?"" from the song ""Causing Trouble.""

Saint Sister have only been putting music out into the world since Madrid, their first EP in 2015, and then Shape of Silence, one of my favorite albums of 2018. There's a spaciousness in this music, something they acknowledge in the title of that album. It's a welcoming sound that works magically in this setting.

July 1, 2019 | Stephen Thompson -- From the moment they arrived for their Tiny Desk debut, the cast and crew of the Broadway musical Be More Chill radiated kind exuberance. They posed for selfies behind the desk, shared stories from the previous night's Tony Awards and clowned around with cast member Jason SweetTooth Williams, who'd torn a muscle in his leg 48 hours earlier and used a wheelchair to get from the charter bus to the desk and back.

The night before, Be More Chill had gone 0-for-1 at the Tonys, winding down a disappointing awards season. Even its big Tonys moment — a skit in which host James Corden parodied the musical's breakout song, ""Michael in the Bathroom"" — passed by without anyone bothering to name the source material.

But you wouldn't have known it the next morning, as the Be More Chill crew — composer Joe Iconis, all but three members of the principal cast and a handful of musicians, each of whom held a key role in shaping the musical's sound — bused from New York to NPR's D.C. headquarters. Their arrival was a genuine event: For our Sesame Street Tiny Desk concert earlier this summer, we'd encouraged our coworkers to bring their young children, but this time around, we asked for their teenagers — the young theater enthusiasts in their lives, and anyone else they knew who'd fallen under the spell of Be More Chill and its pair of prolifically streamed cast albums. (Set to wiry, hard-driving synth-rock music, the show has been a true cult phenomenon, with an intense online following and one of the youngest audiences Broadway has ever seen. But its ticket sales waned and the show is now scheduled to close August 11.)

Each song they performed at the Tiny Desk tapped into a key plot point from Be More Chill, which tells the story of Jeremy, an average high-school geek whose life is upended when he swallows a pill-sized supercomputer that teaches him how to improve his social standing, albeit at the expense of his closest relationships and mental well-being.

On the Broadway stage, Be More Chill has been a playful burst of frenetic energy and silly, stealthy sweetness. At the Tiny Desk, it holds onto that rowdy, generous spirit while peeling off bells and whistles to reveal some remarkably sturdy songcraft. In any form, it's a joy to behold.

June 26, 2019 | Josh Rogosin -- One of my favorite things about Tiny Desk concerts is that artists are often inspired to experiment. Betty Who was in town recently for a three-night residency at D.C.'s famed 9:30 Club where her sound was larger than life. The subwoofers cranked out backing tracks you could feel in your gut and dancers flanked the pop star, punctuating every pulsating beat. But she began her Tiny Desk performance with only her cello and her voice — the first time she's ever accompanied one of her original songs with the instrument. She grew up in Sydney, Australia, and started playing at the age of four (just like Yo-Yo Ma). Maybe it had something to do with her mom being in the room, but emotions ran high for the charismatic and chatty singer. ""I didn't want to be the girl who played cello and sang,"" she told the crowd gathered to watch. ""'Cause that girl feels really far away from ass-out, sparkle-covered pop-star me.""

Betty Who's third LP, Betty, falls squarely in the Roséwave, sun's-out, buns-out pop genre. When all the studio production is stripped away, what's left are intricate melodies that soar through Betty's impressive vocal range and relatable lyrics. As the audio engineer for the Tiny Desk concert series, I'm always curious how the vocals will translate without the aid of pitch correction and tons of effects you hear on the album. I'm a sucker for great melody and Betty Who's raw vocal performance at her Tiny Desk had me in a state of aural ecstasy.

Adding to the jazzy vibe of the intimate performance are Betty's touring musicians, Myla Bocage on keys and Ian Barnett on the drum pad. Jemila Dunham is in full-on beast-mode on bass.

Betty Who says she dreamed of having a Tiny Desk concert ever since she was a teenager. She chose to end hers by asking everyone to sing along to the track, ""I Remember."" The melody worms its way into my ear, whisking me off to summer in my mind's eye. Poolside. Glass of rosé in hand. Later, I'm jumping up and down at the club in perfect sync with new-found friends. Everyone's screaming along to the words as I realize I'm not sun-kissed, I'm sunburned. Never mind, it's time to sing:

Dancing under the stars

Kissing you in the dark

I remember your love, oh

Never giving you up, giving you up, oh

June 24, 2019 | Suraya Mohamed -- I first saw Tasha Cobbs Leonard sing live in my church's 4,000-seat sanctuary. Her voice easily powered-over the PA system and I was amazed by how well I could hear its beautiful resonance and clarity. Since my producer hat is always on, I couldn't wait to invite her to perform here at the desk. Months later, sitting just a few feet away, I was captivated by the un-amplified brilliance that filled the room.

While her impeccable talent is one of the reasons Tasha Cobbs Leonard is regarded as one of the best gospel singers performing today — she's won numerous awards, including a Grammy — on her website she simply credits ""God's grace as the reason for it all.""

Her Tiny Desk set started out with one of her favorite songs and her most popular tune, ""Break Every Chain,"" an anthem that reminds many of us that ""there is power in the name of Jesus.""

Her second song, ""You Know My Name,"" is one Cobbs Leonard wrote a few years ago with South African musician and friend, Brenton Brown. Before beginning she explained that ""the song talks about how God knows you outside of what anybody else has called you. Sometimes people will try and speak things over you that God did not design for your life; and no matter what they've said about you, He knows who He called you to be and what your purpose is on Earth."" The message was so powerful, many in the audience were moved to tears.

The performance ended with a country-influenced tune, ""The River of the Lord,"" written by her husband, musical director and producer, Kenneth Leonard, along with some of their friends. Originally from Jesup, Georgia, Cobbs Leonard explained that ""where I'm from, this is called a hand-clapping, foot-stomping, church song. We're going to clap a little bit, put a smile on our faces and celebrate the river and the joy of the Lord.""

June 20, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- In the course of a few songs at the Tiny Desk, Imogen Heap took us through her many musical talents. The concert began with her old Frou Frou musical partner, Guy Sigsworth — and their first new song in 17 years — and ended with an extraordinary demonstration and performance of her high-tech musical gloves.

Imogen Heap not only has an enchanting voice but also the talents of a world-class audio engineer. She's completely engrossed in a technology she's helped to develop, one that makes it possible to alter sounds, create loops and compose tunes all with the wave of her glove-wearing hands. The high-tech gloves, now called Mi.Mu Gloves, were first shown at a TEDGlobal conference eight years ago. Her performances, with her sound-altering arm and hand gestures, resemble a summoning of spirits, a far more compelling live experience than what Imogen said used to look like she was standing behind her laptop checking email.

And though there's not been a new Imogen Heap album since 2014, this Tiny Desk Concert includes a reworking of ""Hide and Seek,"" the song that made her a household name, and one she reimagined for the Broadway play, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.

It's a thoroughly enchanting Tiny Desk Concert.

wMehItNQKAA,IDLES: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Watch Idles play ""Never Fight A Man With A Perm"", ""Mercedes Marxist"" and ""I'm Scum"" at the Tiny Desk.


June 18, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- My first time seeing Idles ended with guitarist Mark ""Bobo"" Bowen frenetically dancing on a bar, his guitar still keeping time, until the swinging neck suddenly shattered some low-hanging, glass lighting fixtures. The band's set at South by Southwest was fierce and I knew it'd be a challenge trying to figure out how to bring that cathartic rage behind my desk. There was talk for a while of some members of the band strapping on pocket-sized guitar amps and beating on a single drum. But a week before this bunch of British madmen arrived at NPR, the instrument list had grown and what ensued was just about the loudest, most fun and most raucous Tiny Desk Concert in memory.

What lead singer Joe Talbot and his mates bring to their shows is a mix of love and outrage. Their songs are often bursts of fury, but the message is insightful and not intended to incite. Joe Talbot says their opening Tiny Desk song, ""Never Fight A Man With A Perm,"" from their album Joy as an Act of Resistance, is an ""exploration of the horrid corners of my past.""

It only took a few seconds for Joe's face to turn blood-red; as he growled, it stayed that way for the next 13-minutes, even as he curtseyed at the end of the first song and bounced his way into the second. ""Bobo"" meanwhile moved from standing and pounding the bass drum to thrashing a guitar. I think a water bottle and some miscellaneous objects got knocked from the shelves while guitarist Lee Kiernan played. But watching his hyperactive movements in this confined space, it's actually hard to believe that so few things broke. ""We are not the Jonas Brothers,"" Joe Talbot explained before their final tune. ""People get confused."" He said this with his charming smile and began to run in place while singing ""I'm Scum,"" just to make it clear who they are.

June 10, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- This just in: The Muppets have arrived at NPR!

The news has stopped!Count von Count and the NPR kids count us down: 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1!

And there they are at the Tiny Desk: Big Bird, Bert and Ernie, Rosita, Abby Cadabby and Cookie Monster, all singing about a sunny day and how everything is A-OK. The Sesame Street crew — including Elmo, Grover and other surprise guests — visited NPR's headquarters in Washington, D.C., to celebrate Sesame Street's 50 years of teaching the world its A-B-Cs, its 1-2-3s, how to be kind and how to be proud, all while spreading love and joy.Sesame Street has won more major awards than any other group to play the Tiny Desk, including 11 Grammys and 192 Emmys. There was a lot of love as the cast of Sesame Street got to meet NPR hosts and newscasters, who in turn got to geek out meeting their favorite Muppets and the creators behind the felt and fur. These folks include Matt Vogel, Sesame Street's puppet captain and performer, and music director Bill Sherman.

I even got to sing with Grover. And I'll also say, on a personal note, that this may well have been the hardest-working, most dedicated group of performers I've ever worked with. I'm so proud of these Muppets and so happy to celebrate all that they've meant to the world for these 50 years.

Jo3XEdt1Yhs,Foxing: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Watch Foxing play Slapstick, Nearer My God and Grand Paradise at the Tiny Desk.



June 12, 2019 | Lyndsey McKenna and Marissa Lorusso -- When we invited Foxing to NPR HQ, we wondered how the band's big sound would translate to such a (forgive us) tiny space. Would Foxing bring a bagpiper to recreate the shrill accent it snuck onto its latest album, 2018's Nearer My God, or try to replicate the cathartic energy of its live shows over the hum of computers and fluorescent lights?

Not quite. Instead, the St. Louis-based group brought the same sense of purpose to its Tiny Desk arrangement that's impressed us across its three full-length releases. Performing to larger audiences with each new album, Foxing is at the forefront of what's referred to as ""emo revival,"" a term for today's crop of bands heavily influenced by late-'90s and early 2000s groups like Sunny Day Real Estate, Cap'n Jazz, American Football and others. But with each new LP, Foxing's ambitions reach beyond the genre's boundaries, incorporating broader inspiration.

For its Tiny Desk, Foxing spotlighted three standout tracks from Nearer My God. The quieter instrumentation pushed singer Conor Murphy's starkly confessional lyrics and shattering delivery to the forefront, especially on the set's opening song, ""Slapstick."" And even with minimal amplification, the swelling chorus of the title cut ""Nearer My God"" is just as impressive as performed during the band's explosive concerts.

For this performance, Foxing expanded its numbers, bringing a saxophonist and a couple of string players to accompany the band's touring lineup — and somehow, we managed to fit everyone behind Bob Boilen's desk.

NyK9DbPzReo,Tomberlin: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Watch Tomberlin play ""Any Other Way"", ""Self-Help"" and ""Untitled 1"" at the Tiny Desk.




June 6, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- Before I bring an artist to the Tiny Desk, I try to see them perform live. It helps me get a handle on what they'll be capable of doing at my desk, minus all the artful tinkering of a studio. But I never saw Tomberlin before she came to my desk. My desire to see Mitski and Overcoats when Tomberlin was last in town had me at another venue and another opportunity failed to happen. But I was simply in love with Tomberlin's ethereal debut album At Weddings and took a chance.

I didn't know how her fragile songs would translate; all I knew was that Tomberlin was coming to the Tiny Desk to play acoustic guitar and sing, along with her musical partner Andrew Boylan. The eerie production that felt like the backbone to the fragile songs on At Weddings would be gone.

But when Tomberlin began to sing at her Tiny Desk Concert, wearing a bit of Tiny Desk nervousness on her sleeve while singing ""I know I'm not eternal, I'm just a young girl,"" these songs questioning her religious beliefs, felt deep and personal.

Tomberlin is the daughter of a Baptist pastor, grew up singing in the church and, since her teens, has questioned her own beliefs in God and faith. And as you listen to her sing these delicate, vulnerable songs, you may find your way to a new songwriter, capable of distilling doubt and isolation while forming a community around her music and expressing assurance.

wzyR_MWEGBU,Quinn Christopherson: NPR Music Tiny Desk Contest Winner 2019,"Watch the 2019 Tiny Desk Contest Winner play at the Tiny Desk.

June 3, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- A moment after our 2019 Tiny Desk Contest winner, Quinn Christopherson, finished his first song at the NPR offices, he made a confession. He looked at me, while tuning his ""vintage white"" Fender Telecaster, and said, ""I don't know if you know this, but when you called me and you told me, 'You won!' I got off the phone and I thought, 'Dang, I should buy a guitar.' Legit, did not have one. But that's Anchorage; that's the music community there. Everyone just borrowed me their stuff long term.""

Quinn and his musical partner, guitarist and singer Nick Carpenter, arrived from the cool of Anchorage to the swelter of D.C. They both donned shorts at the desk; Quinn's were newly cut off to conform to the weather.

What was most striking about their performance was their unfettered confidence. Watching them play together and hearing their songs, with their interweaving guitar lines and vocal harmonies, feels like seeing two brothers performing old favorites. The concert was fun and, at moments, reverent.

After opening with his brand-new tune, ""You Told Me,"" Quinn sang ""Glenn,"" a moving song about his father and their beautiful two-peas-in-a pod relationship. There's a line in that song that goes to the heart of Quinn's songwriting talents: ""My dad, he plays guitar, says he knows more than he can do. He tells me that I do more than I know."" Quinn writes story-songs about what he knows best, his mom and sister, about their addictions and his love for them. But on his contest-winning song, the one that closes this Tiny Desk performance, he took a close look at himself. ""Erase Me"" is about his recent transition, what it now means to be a man and how he sees the way the world treats him differently after so many years of being ""used to pulling the short stick"" as a woman. It's a revealing look at the roles of men and women in our culture at a pivotal time from a songwriter who, I believe, will be a defining voice in the future of music.

LIP7efANp0E,LADAMA: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Watch LADAMA perform ""Sin Ataduras"", ""Elo"", ""Tierra Tiembla"", and ""Inmigrante"" at the Tiny Desk.




May 30, 2019 | Felix Contreras -- During the course of their performance behind the desk, the four core members of LADAMA — Lara Klaus, Daniela Serna, Mafer Bandola and Sara Lucas — had a chance to display their individual cultural and musical roots as part of an engaging and mesmerizing whole. Represented in glorious musical virtuosity are Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela, with a dash of New York City thrown in just to make it interesting.

The video starts, for example, zeroed-in on the Venezuelan bandola llanera (or an updated version of it) while another song starts with the Brazilian pandeiro. Those instruments are put to work on rhythms from each of those countries, as well as Colombia, in songs that always percolate, even at slower tempos.

The four women in LADAMA met at a music workshop. Each are also music educators and dedicated to both celebrating and expanding the idea of cultural expression, with the help of bassist Pat Swoboda.

It's the fiery ""Inmigrante"" that finally raised the BPM meter and got hips swaying in our corner of NPR's HQ, with its call-and-response back-and-forth and a very enthusiastic audience. The band left us after the performance to travel to Brazil and record their next album. Judging from their musical spirit on display here, it can only mean great things to come.

nsM_d4eb3XM,Lucky Daye: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Watch Lucky Daye play ""Roll Some Mo"", ""Misunderstood"" and
""Late Night"" at the Tiny Desk.



May 28, 2019 | Sidney Madden -- Sometimes, a Tiny Desk is just meant to be. NPR Music's Bobby Carter and I have been checking for Lucky Daye since last year when we dubbed him one of the ""Kings of R&B."" Then, after seeing Lucky perform live in Washington D.C., we knew his charisma and control, even for a new name, would translate well to the Tiny Desk. The same week we saw him live for the first time, we knew he was ready for the challenge.

Hailing from New Orleans and inheriting a love of sticky, bass-bumping funk early on, Lucky wanted to bring the full flavor of his debut album, Painted to NPR. So he brought along a 10-person band, including a quartet of horns, and his go-to producer Dernst ""D'Mile"" Emile II on bass. Like the record, which incorporates bouncy pop, a light, wallowing nod to jazz and show-stopping soul (notice the dramatic pause of the beat during the final song, ""Late Night""), Lucky took the vibe of the Tiny Desk from chill to rowdy within the span of 15 minutes. He even let the audience in on a secret: ""I've never performed that song in front of anyone with a band,"" he said, trying to laugh off mid-set jitters and bask in the moment. ""This is amazing, y'all. I'm really grateful.""

HF6CfGndHH8,Jeremy Dutcher: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"May 22, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- Jeremy Dutcher came to the Tiny Desk with sparkling, purple streams of glitter draped around his shoulders. Then he set his iPad on our Yamaha upright piano, not to read his score as pianists do these days, but to play a centuries-old wax cylinder recording of a song sung in the incredibly rare language of Wolastoq. Jeremy Dutcher, along with cellist Blanche Israel and percussionist and electronics wizard Greg Harrison, wove that old recording into a remarkably passionate performance that was very 21st-century, with a deep nod to a century past.

There is no one making music like this 27-year-old, classically trained opera tenor and pianist. He's not only a member of the Tobique First Nation in New Brunswick, Canada, but one of fewer than 100 people who still speak — and in his case also sing — in Wolastoq. His Tiny Desk performance illustrates his deep respect for his heritage, even as he sings through vocal processors and looping devices of the very present. It's a dialog with the past that earned him a Polaris prize for his 2018 album Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa (one of NPR Music's top albums of that year). But more importantly, he stresses awareness of a people nearly extinct, to a culture often too steeped in the present.

Watch this remarkably artful performance and take a moment to reflect on those who inhabited our recent past and remain a part of who we are.

BVnSJ4SL7sI,Magos Herrera and Brooklyn Rider: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"May 15, 2019 | Tom Huizenga -- When the intrepid string quartet known as Brooklyn Rider first visited the Tiny Desk nine years ago, no one knew what the musicians might play. They're as likely to trot out an Asian folk tune as they are a string quartet by Beethoven, or one of their own compositions.

For this visit though, we knew exactly what was on tap. The band, fronted by the smoky-voiced Magos Herrera and backed by percussionist Mathias Kunzli, performed three songs from the album Dreamers, a collection steeped in Latin American traditions.

The versatile Mexican singer, who has never sounded more expressive, notes that these songs emerge from struggle.

Gilberto Gil's bossa nova-inspired ""Eu vim da Bahia"" is a tribute to his home state. He released it in 1965 as Brazil's military dictatorship took charge. The atmospheric, flamenco-tinged ""La Aurora de Nueva York,"" by Vicente Amigo, sets a gritty depiction of the city by Federico García Lorca, who fell to assassins during the Spanish Civil War in 1936. And ""Balderrama,"" by the Argentine folk legend Gustavo Leguizamón, ruminates on a café which served as a safe haven for artists to talk about their work.

The music and the poetry, Herrera explained, ""transcended dark times"" for its authors. These fresh performances, imbued with both joy and pain, recall the past and point to the present.

jd99SAKuun8,Ensemble Signal Plays Jonny Greenwood: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"May 20, 2019 | Jonny Greenwood -- I've watched a lot of Tiny Desk concerts over the years. It's good to see musicians in the raw, away from stage lighting and backing tracks — as if they've just stopped by an office to play over a lunch break, with desk-bound employees watching on. The performances should expose flaws, but instead they tend to expose musicians being casually brilliant, like the members of Ensemble Signal, who certainly play these pieces beautifully.



Unfortunately, I was nowhere near Washington, D.C. for this recording. And I still find it bizarre that you can put a musical idea on paper and have it reproduced at such a distance — and with such added life. We're used to sounds and images being shared as exact clones of one another, but the pleasure in using ink and paper is that the music is interpreted rather than just reproduced. All those years of practice, in all those players, distilled into 15 minutes of music. It's a big privilege — and a continuing motivation to write the best I can.

The first piece, Three Miniatures from Water, was originally a sketch for an Australian Chamber Orchestra commission in 2014. I thought it'd be easier to approach writing for full orchestra by starting with a piano miniature and scaling it up. In fact, only some of the material made it to the final commission, and I always felt the original three miniatures hung together well enough as its own piece of music.

I'm a big admirer of composer Olivier Messiaen, and one of the musical scales he favored was the octatonic mode. It's a lot like an Indian rag in that it's a rigid set of notes, yet isn't necessarily in a major or minor key. There are hundreds of rags in Indian music, but I was surprised to find that Messiaen's octatonic scale isn't one of them. Despite this, it sits nicely over a drone — and that was the starting point for this music. That and the glorious sound of the tanpura, the drone instrument that underpins everything in classical Indian music.

The piece is called Water, after the Philip Larkin poem with the same title, and was especially inspired by the final stanza:

And I should raise in the east
A glass of water
Where any-angled light
Would congregate endlessly.

The second piece, called 88 (No. 1), is also in one of Messiaen's modes in the first half, before becoming a celebration of the mechanical nature of the piano. The performer has to put fingerless gloves on halfway through, partly in tribute to the immortal Glenn Gould, and partly because the technique requires some painful hammering. But don't let that fool you into thinking the music is dark or angry: It is — or is meant to be — joyful.

LB96pjoQrtM,Ohmme: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"May 9, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- When Sima Cunningham and Macie Stewart fired up their angular guitar sounds during soundcheck at the Tiny Desk, I was thrilled. The shrieking, rhythmic noise these two classically trained musicians make as Ohmme is what made their debut album, Parts, a musical highlight for me in 2018. But hearing them in the office, trading vocals with such ping-pong precision, sent me into euphoria. This is now one of my all-time favorite Tiny Desk concerts.

Sima Cunningham and Macie Stewart, along with drummer Matt Carroll, steer clear of rock music clichés that plague so much of the music I hear these days. Their adventurous spirit, reminiscent of Dirty Projectors, is sometimes challenging. But it opens a window on what the voice can be. It also redefines what the guitar can do — at one moment it's a stuttering percussive instrument, the next it's a bed of noise with a harsh tone that somehow morphs its way into the melody.

For this Tiny Desk, we hear four well-crafted songs from that 2018 album, Parts, with subject matters ranging from the wretched times we live in to understanding human behavior and the tale of an aging grandmother who loses her body before her mind. This brilliant band from Chicago has a creative future ahead of it, and I feel like we captured a bit of lightning in a bottle and a glimpse toward that bright future.

IUVYgCwpv7Y,Thou: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"May 6, 2019 | Lars Gotrich -- The first-ever metal band at the Tiny Desk is a little bit of a head fake. Make no mistake, Thou makes some of the heaviest, most tortuous music around; but the band also constantly experiments with beautifully ornate arrangements that balance its most extreme measures. In a set culled from the acoustic-driven Inconsolable — one of six full-lengths, EPs and splits the band released last year (no, really) — Thou shows us just how crushing quiet can be.

""This is the softest I've ever played,"" guitarist KC Stafford told me during sound check. Yes, their downtuned guitars are turned down low at the NPR Music office, but the weight is still ever-present. Stafford takes the lead on ""The Hammer"" as co-vocalists Emily McWilliams and Melissa Guion (who also makes ambient-pop music under the name MJ Guider) sing, ""Bring down the hammer / A bludgeon to my shrines / Bring down the hammer / To the corpse of my worship."" These are the cryptic lyrics and melodies largely written by Bryan Funck, who normally screams his existential despair for Thou. But for these songs and this Tiny Desk, he lurked in the audience.

Thou's decade-plus discography is an exercise in exploration and refinement, finding new textures in heft, which is why this set offers such a slow-burning thrill to its oeuvre. Case in point: the closing cut, ""The Unspeakable Oath,"" lead by guitarist Matthew Thudium, is a twinkling grunge song that overlaps guitar melodies with the grace and grandiosity of a whale.

apUE3nAeszw,Laraaji: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"May 2, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- Prepare to be calmed.

It begins with a small bell, a set of tiny wind chimes and a plucked, angelic zither sounding much like a harp. Laraaji and his musical partner Arji ""OceAnanda"" Cakouros came to NPR draped in loose-fitted, saffron-tinted clothes, with a table draped in a similar orange fabric — almost the tones of a setting sun with all the beauty that implies. As I watched, I could feel my breath letting go; my muscles were less tense. Then Laraaji began to laugh. I smiled. (His laugh is infectious). Then more of us in the office smiled as he brushed rhythms on his zither and processed the sounds to add delay and intensify the hypnotic pulse.

I first discovered the music of Laraaji almost 40 years ago when Brian Eno produced an ambient album of his music called Ambient 3: Day of Radiance as part of a series of ambient records from Eno that began with 1978's Ambient 1: Music for Airports. Edward Larry Gordon, now known as Laraaji, was a comedian as well as a musician. I suppose that explains the laughter as part of his meditative and therapeutic music. Laraaji is now in his mid-70s, has released over 50 recordings as well as an abundance of sound-healing sessions. His concert in the NPR offices was proof of the atmospheric, altering power of the music he makes along with Arji. Maybe you'll find yourself enjoying a musical sunset plopped down right in the middle of your day.

hYnC7FCsNO8,Toro y Moi: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"April 29, 2019 | Bobby Carter -- Chaz Bear, who performs as Toro y Moi, is going to do what he feels. In preparation for his Tiny Desk concert, we were given two possible sound scenarios: aim to recreate the heavily electronic and lustrous aura that birthed his latest LP, Outer Peace or strip away the bells and whistles for an acoustic performance. The game-time decision was the latter and fans were treated to brand new iterations of these songs.

Toro y Moi's discography conveys that same unpredictability and showcases his affinity for a wide span of genres. While largely known as an early pioneer of chillwave, Outer Peace is anything but. It's hard-hitting, funky and directly to the point, as is this Tiny Desk concert. Stripping down such heavily produced songs could risk revealing weaknesses. In this case, the rhythms move just the same. Removing the Auto-Tune, synths and effects make way for some insightful songwriting that's often hard to hear in the recorded version.

""Life is only wishing we could load it
Level up, you've got to make a bonus
Mystic staring at his phone for oneness
Silver or black mirror, what's the difference?""

With shaker in tow, Bear sat front and center at a stool to deliver four of my favorites from Outer Peace, including ""Ordinary Pleasure,"" with bongo assistance from Foots of Foot and Coles.

ucV-erYqy8U,The Calidore String Quartet: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"April 22, 2019 | Tom Huizenga -- If just one thing can be confirmed from these compelling Tiny Desk performances by the Calidore String Quartet, it should be that the centuries-old formula – two violins, a viola and a cello – is still very much alive and evolving. Indeed, an impromptu show of hands in the audience before the concert began revealed that almost everyone had seen a string quartet perform live.

The genre was born some 250 years ago and pioneered by Joseph Haydn, but composers today are still tinkering with its possibilities. Consider Caroline Shaw. The young, Pulitzer-winning composer wrote the opening work in this set, First Essay: Nimrod, especially for the Calidore String Quartet.

Over a span of eight minutes, the supple theme that opens this extraordinary work takes a circuitous adventure. It unfolds into a song for the cello, is sliced into melodic shards, gets bathed in soft light, becomes gritty and aggressive and disguises itself in accents of the old master composers. Midway through, the piece erupts in spasms that slowly dissolve back into the theme.

The Calidore players also chose music by the quirky Czech composer, Leoš Janáček who, in 1913, set one of his operas on the moon. He wrote only two string quartets but they are dazzling. The opening Adagio, from his first quartet, is typical Janáček, with hairpin turns that veer from passionate romance to prickly anxiety.

Reaching back farther, the ensemble closes the set with an early quartet by Beethoven, who took what Haydn threw down and ran with it. The final movement from Beethoven's Fourth Quartet both looks back at Haydn's elegance and implies the rambunctious, even violent, risks his music would soon take.

The performance turns out to be a fascinating through-line, traced from Beethoven's early incarnation of the string quartet, straight through to Caroline Shaw's new sounds, which occasionally glance backward.

SET LIST
Caroline Shaw: ""First Essay: Nimrod""
Janáček: ""String Quartet No. 1, 'Adagio'""
Beethoven: ""String Quartet Op. 18, No. 4, Allegro - Prestissimo""

j1Yz-NyLV90,Better Oblivion Community Center: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"April 24, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- When this fabulous new duo arrived for their Tiny Desk, it felt like old friends coming home. Both Conor Oberst and Phoebe Bridgers are Tiny Desk alum. Conor's first Tiny Desk Concert came during his Upside Down Mountain Tour in 2014. Phoebe has come by twice in the past few years, first as a solo artist in 2017 and then as part of another creative and collaborative endeavor with Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker as boygenius in 2018. So, unlike the bundle of nerves that often come with an appearance at the NPR offices, this one was fun and, at times, silly, like when Conor Oberst sang into a fake rubber microphone on the other end of a chopstick that was sitting on my desk. But there was nothing trivial about the songs or the collaboration.

Better Oblivion Community Center came as a surprise to us all this year and, at the moment, their self-titled release is my favorite record of 2019. It's that rare musical partnership where each injects vibrancy into the other's creative side. And when their voices intertwine, there's a radiance that often feels joyful even while singing words like the ones on their opening number, ""Dylan Thomas.""

""I'm getting used to these dizzy spells
I'm taking a shower at the Bates Motel
I'm getting greedy with this private hell
I'll go it alone, but that's just as well""

Christian Lee Hutson backed the duet on guitar and electronics. Phoebe and Conor also had me playing whirly tube on the final tune, ""My City."" So I was whipping a corrugated, ribbed plastic hose over my head, creating a high pitched siren sound, trying to blend in with Christian's electronics on ""My City."" It was my Tiny Desk performance debut, and I was thrilled to be part of this magical act.

yNG0ZoWjrJM,Theodore: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"April 17, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- Our bright, sunny office took a dark, moody turn as Theodore's music began. The pulsing, throbbing rhythm gave way to a lyrical piano line and, by the time Theodore began to sing, a dark vibe had cast over the Tiny Desk. That's the transformative magic that is the music of Greek composer/performer, Theodore. The opening song, titled ""Disorientation,"" explores the complete loss of inner direction as Theodore examines his inner dualities in search of clarity and, perhaps, new ways to look at the world.

Watch the way these five musicians navigate these tunes. There is finesse and attention to detail; each note, each beat of Theodore's music feels essential and well-timed. It's the sort of spare elegance you can hear in Sigur Rós or Pink Floyd.

Theodore's 2018 album Inner Dynamics has been a late-evening companion in my life. Now, having seen its transformative powers in broad daylight, I can see that it's the music — and music alone — that casts its sorcery.

SjFo6l4c-oc,Gary Clark Jr.: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"April 16, 2019 | Stephen Thompson -- Gary Clark Jr. had good reason to sweat. The blues-rock singer and guitarist opted to play his first-ever Tiny Desk concert — in front of a huge crowd that warmed the room considerably — while clad in a thick knit cap and heavy jacket. Plus, he'd brought his young son on tour with him and had to contend with a traditional parenting dilemma: How do you bring your kid to the office and still get work done?

But once Clark and his formidable band got done cranking out three songs from this year's blistering This Land, he wasn't the only one in the room who needed to wipe away the sweat. Clark's set leaned toward some of This Land's softer sentiments — ""When I'm Gone"" is about missing his family on the road, while ""Pearl Cadillac"" exudes gratitude for his mother's sacrifices — leaving its more politically incendiary material for louder live shows. But these songs still roared with the assurance and force of a showman at the top of his game.

qoyc83-56EY,Karine Polwart Trio: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"April 10, 2019 | Suraya Mohamed -- Scottish singer, songwriter and essayist Karine Polwart seldom comes stateside. She prefers to limit air travel in order to minimize her carbon footprint. She took exception, however, to fly from Edinburgh to New York City to participate in the Carnegie Hall Migrations festival, a celebration of the history of the movement of people all around the world. Polwart and her brother, guitarist Steven Polwart and multi-instrumentalist, Inge Thomson, then escaped New York for a day to play the Tiny Desk here in Washington, D.C.

Polwart writes songs about hope, music that harnesses spiritual power and lyrics that address important social justice themes. Stories of human emotion and the human experience are also commonplace as in the first tune, ""Ophelia.""

""There's a wind in from the desert
Red dust blows across the sun
It bleeds into the evening
We watch it from the garden
Your hair glints in the strange yellow light
We let go of all our fighting
Ophelia""

Her second song at the desk, ""I Burn But I Am Not Consumed,"" includes a mesmerizing spoken word denunciation of President Donald Trump, while the closing tune, ""King of Birds,"" praises the power of small things. In it Polwart recounts the legend of a wren who piggybacks a lift on an eagle's wing. Just as the large bird is unable to fly any higher in the sky, the tiny wren catches a breath of air, soars higher than the eagle and is crowned the king of all birds.

""At Ludgate Hill
where the towers of smoke and mirrors bruise the sky
the pilgrims huddle in
as the tiny King of Birds begins to cry
the people start to sing
to light glory in the dark
to ring the bell
and to breathe hope in every heart""

Lyricism and messages of hope and beauty heard throughout punctuate a stunning accompaniment of inventive instrumentation. The steady, resonant guitar riffs played by Steven Polwart ground the delicate vocal harmonies. Inge Thomson's accordion lines, combined with an array of percussion instruments and synth-generated effects, add a complimentary layer of sound without overpowering the music. Karine Polwart's bellowing and drone-like Shruti box provides a sweet serenity.

This performance will quite likely inspire you to learn more about Polwart. The NPR program, The Thistle and Shamrock often features her music. This recent episode features cuts from Polwart's latest album, plus her ideas on movement and migration.

8Otlu-H_5to,Georgia Anne Muldrow: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"April 8,  2019 | Bobby Carter -- Georgia Anne Muldrow is all about showing and spreading love. That fact became clear as we discussed the set list for her Tiny Desk performance. She and the band were floating the possibility of swapping the duet with her partner in music and life, Dudley Perkins with another song. But she decided it was more important to showcase their shared love on the song ""Flowers,"" originally from Perkins' 2003 album A Lil' Light.

The first song I ever heard from Georgia Anne Muldrow, back in the early 2000s, was called ""Break You Down."" The opening line spoke directly to my experience as a twentysomething coming into my own:

""Don't let them make you forget who you are
Don't let them break you down""

I later found that she wrote, produced and performed that song when she was only 17-years old. She possessed talent and perspective beyond her years and I became a fan.

Some time would pass before she eventually released her debut album, Olesi: Fragments of an Earth, in 2006. Since then, she's released well over a dozen, mostly self-produced projects. While much of her music's focus has been on the healing, preservation and education of African American people, the themes are universal: family, struggle and of course, love. The beats are a combination of J Dilla and Battlecat while her voice carries soul that sounds like it was groomed in the backwoods of Jackson, Miss. She's also made a name for herself as a collaborator with artists that include Madlib, Mos Def and Erykah Badu, with whom she introduced the notion of ""staying woke"" to the world, years before it was appropriated as a hashtag.

During her set, Muldrow performed, reworked and animated versions of the song ""Flowers,"" along with two selections from her latest album, Overload, including an extended and jazzy version of ""Ciao.""

-pRkWrQgTWI,Courtney Marie Andrews: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"April 3, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- It was a day when sunlight drenched the office and the songs of heart from Courtney Marie Andrews felt right at home. It's been a year since her comforting album, May Your Kindness Remain, came out. Amazingly it's her sixth record, and yet she's still a just few years shy of 30. The opening number here at the Tiny Desk, the album's title track, is a shining example of why the songs of Courtney Marie Andrews endure, beginning with her words, based on friendships, and the understanding of a kind soul.

""And if your money runs out
And your good looks fade
May your kindness remain
Oh, may your kindness remain""

Then there's her voice, with a power that feels so unexpected coming from her small frame. Courtney Marie supports the stories she tells with her delicate yet powerful guitar and a band of musicians here at the Tiny Desk with a great understanding of the subtleties that make her music sustain and strengthen over many listens.

t8UKQJZsv4o,Weezer: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"April 1, 2019 | Robin Hilton -- This is probably the loosest you'll ever see Weezer. Known for meticulously produced — and electric — live shows, frontman Rivers Cuomo and the rest of the band settled in behind the Tiny Desk for an entirely acoustic set without the in-ear monitors, click track or vocal separation they usually employ to stay locked-in and tight for bigger performances. The result is surprisingly intimate, with songs that feel lived-in and rumpled, like an old flannel shirt from the '90s.

Weezer opened with one of the band's rarer songs: ""Longtime Sunshine,"" a 1994 track that's only appeared as a Rivers Cuomo home recording on bootlegs and compilations, and on the deluxe edition of Pinkerton. Then the band performed a stripped-down version of its electro-pop song ""Living in L.A.,"" from Weezer's new self-titled ""Black Album,"" followed by another deep cut, ""Across the Sea."" It's a song Cuomo originally wrote in his early 20s, inspired by a fan letter he'd received from a young woman in Japan. While beloved by many Gen-Xers who'd first heard it on 1996's Pinkerton, the song's lyrics haven't aged terribly well.

Weezer returned to its newest material to close the set with ""High as a Kite,"" from the new album. A song of innocence and escapism, Cuomo sings about daydreaming and how he wants to disappear — which is exactly what the band did once the song was over, but not before Cuomo told the crowd, ""We are Weezer, from the planet Earth. Have a nice life!""

HN4Mk3LWWC4,Andrea Cruz: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"March 27, 2019 | Felix Contreras -- Andrea Cruz brought a little bit of Puerto Rico with her when she took her place behind the Tiny Desk. It was present by way of the flag she hung up on the shelves, as well as in the lyrics of the songs and the style of music she expresses herself with.

It's important to note that the instrumentation of the band that traveled with her (keyboard, two percussionists and trombone) hardly fits what you'd expect music from the island to sound like these days. But Cruz is part of a movement in Puerto Rico that emphasizes largely acoustic instruments and a folk-based approach to interpreting life before and after the hurricane of 2017. It's a bold creative statement in a land of reggaeton and salsa.

Cruz drew on songs from her first album, 2017's Tejido de Laurel. The emotion of the lyrics of the first song, ""No Toquemos Tierra,"" is evident in her angelic voice as she makes a declaration of love for the earth as a metaphor for a lover. The beauty of the song is in her poetic lyrics set to a melody that defies language.

I was very pleased to see that Cruz's live performance is very much like the stripped-down sound on her album and the handful of singles she's released. In fact, I would say her music is a perfect soundtrack to a growing, back-to-nature movement in Puerto Rico that encourages local farming and a careful stewardship of the environment. ""Santas Flores"" also digs deep into that philosophy as she sings about ""holy flowers.""

Andrea Cruz spent her time talking to the audience in a mix of English and Spanish and there was no mistaking the intense feeling behind her song about femicide on the island in the song, ""Canción de Amargura."" The sound of the entire ensemble was elevated by Cruz's plaintive vocals at the end.

Andrea Cruz is a bright new voice coming from an island with a deep history of revered vocalists and, as you can see, she more than holds her own.

jxIK19PQngA,&More (Chill Moody & Donn T): NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"March 25, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- I had a surprise for Chill Moody when he arrived at the Tiny Desk: a concealed strawberry shortcake (his favorite) for his 34th birthday. His musical partners, singer Donn T and the rest of his Philly crew known as &More, all brought out the cake and candles, sharing in the celebration. It was a fitting moment to have between the group's performance of inspirational songs. &More's music is often about the experience of being black in America, blending hip-hop and R&B with a motivational message and a Philadelphia flair. The three songs they played are from their debut album Ethyl Bobcat, coming out on April 5.

I first discovered &More while sifting through hundreds of Tiny Desk Contest video entries last year. Their standout video was for a song called ""WHOA,"" which is also the third song they played during their visit to the Tiny Desk. It's a song that expresses exasperation at current events, when words just can't be found, and when all one can say is, ""whoa!"" But despite the intensity of the subject matter, much of what &More, Donn T and Chill Moody play stays positive. You can hear it in the refrain of the song: ""The hate you give, won't stop and let you think; the love you save keeps you on the brink."" The positivity is infectious.

YxUaLKJ_978,Alejandro Escovedo: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"March 20, 2019 | Felix Contreras -- When Alejandro Escovedo and his backing band known as Don Antonio set up behind the Tiny Desk, their first sounds were blistering loud. That's when we broke the news: We wouldn't amplify Alejandro's voice. We got a slightly sullen look from the band; but despite the toned-down volume, they were all still amped up.

The musician, who once opened for the Sex Pistols, obliged with a smile and seemed to appreciate the difference between being pelted with spit and debris by punk rock fans and being showered with loving appreciation in the NPR Music office.

Escovedo pulled the three-song set from The Crossing, the most recent chapter in his ongoing odyssey and a typically hard-rocking, literate saga about two teenagers looking for their American Dream of rock and roll and beat poetry.

The close quarters of the Tiny Desk allows for a kind of backstage insight into the musical and visual interplay between Escovedo and the veteran Italian band Don Antonio. Lead guitarist Antonio Gramentieri is the perfect foil for Escovedo, who adds a heavy dose of edginess to the sound with his power strumming.

Alejandro Escovedo fans are a close-knit group. We've followed his lead and have been treated to various musical aggregations over the years. But as you see in this video, this setup seems to be working just fine and may be his strongest yet.

Set List

xdGLK_sOWb0,Nao: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"March 18, 2019 | Sidney Madden -- In astrology, your Saturn return is the time in life when Saturn goes back to the same spot it was at the time of your birth. As Nao explained during her appearance at NPR's Tiny Desk, ""It's about leaving adolescence and going into adulthood."" This crossing of the threshold that happens around your late 20s to early 30s is the inspiration for Saturn, Nao's sophomore effort and one of 2018's best albums. When the U.K. singer-songwriter brought her band and cosmic energy to the Tiny Desk — sneaking in her 2015 breakthrough track, ""Bad Blood,"" alongside Saturn standouts — the strength and conviction of her performance had fans in the office strapped in for the emotional ride.

While Nao usually performs with synthy, electronic twinkles, her day at the Tiny Desk was stripped down by comparison. At times, her lyrics ring out with just a sparse guitar to carry them. Like a roller coaster of unexpected upheaval, Nao's distinctive vocal range on this four-song set goes from bellowing and husky to soft and coy, often within the same verse. Be it the breezy, Brazilian funk of ""If You Ever,"" the hallowed harmony of ""Orbit"" (complete with prayer hands) or the valiant soul-searching of ""Make It Out Alive,"" it's almost as if Nao duets with herself, answering her own questions, settling into her own quirks.

Saturn return can be marked with new responsibilities, confusion and poison-thorned serendipity. But by creating astral, intentional music through her growing pains, Nao ended up grounding herself.

jmvz0ZdVphg,Kaia Kater: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"March 13, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- The expectation upon seeing a banjo hanging is one of rollicking rowdiness, but when Kaia Kater began to strum her five-string, the mood in the office turned plaintive and a bit mournful. The Afro-Caribbean-Canadian singer and songwriter, who studied Appalachian music at West Virginia's Davis & Elkins College, often references the Black Lives Matter movement, within a music form that doesn't exactly snap to mind as being in dialogue with modern issues.

These days, Kaia Kater records for Smithsonian Folkways, and some of the songs she brought to the Tiny Desk come from her recent recording Grenades, a record she worked on while exploring her father's home country of Grenada.

It's a country that has ""experienced a lot of political turmoil,"" she says. ""My father left when he was 16 years old and he came to Canada as a refugee, on his own. It's a story I ran away from for a long time, where I didn't want to reconcile with myself being this kind of hyphenated Canadian."" Kaia Kater tries to come to terms with that history on the last song at the Tiny Desk, also the title track of Grenades. ""Rain heavy like carpet bombs, sweetgrass, and lemonade / Fold the memory into your arms and whisper it away."" The imagery is stunning, her Tiny Desk Concert sublime.

AB-S8wL-AKY,Leikeli47: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"March 11, 2019 | Rodney Carmichael -- Remember that scene in The Color Purple when Shug Avery was somewhere between the juke joint and her daddy's church, singing at the top of her lungs, and the Saturday night sinners got all mixed in with the Sunday morning saints, and it was hard to tell if they were praising the high heavens or raising holy hell?

That's what Leikeli47's Tiny Desk felt like in the flesh.

She came masked up, as always, the better to catch a glimpse of her soul. And there was so much soul to bare. Backed by a four-piece band of bruhs dressed as uniformed TSA agents (introduced as ""the TSA Band, taking flight with me""), Leikeli47 and her working-class crew proceeded to transform Bob Boilen's Tiny Desk into something akin to a pulpit or a mid-century parlor room. Portier sat hunched over the upright piano, while Justus West plucked guitar strings, Simba Scott tapped out bass lines and Timmy Manson Jr. kept everything in sync on drums.

They traversed the entirety of black music, translating her hip-hop and afro-electro empowerment anthems to live instruments by jazzing up songs like ""Attitude,"" from her 2017 Wash & Set major-label debut, and laying down the vamps on ""Girl Blunt"" from her 2018 LP Acrylic. It wasn't genre-bending as much as it was a musical remembering of the blues that brought her here — from the hoods of Brooklyn to down-south Virginia and everywhere else she's called home.

In an era when women are no longer the anomaly but rap's new standard bearers, Leikeli47 deserves all the praise for pushing the genre forward with both feet steeped firmly in tradition.

vSMt8qbhu0w,Meg Myers: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"March 6, 2019 | Robin Hilton -- Meg Myers put out one of 2018's most intense and cathartic albums. Take Me to the Disco raged and threw sonic punches at anyone who'd ever attempted to use or abuse her, from former record executives to past lovers. Dressed in a sparkling blue leotard, Myers re-creates that fire and ferocity behind the Tiny Desk, replacing her album's roaring electric guitars and electronics with a pulsing string quartet, piano and brushed drums.

But the most intense part of the performance is Myers herself. The distant, piercing looks she gives during the set's opening cut, ""Jealous Sea,"" are unforgettable and unforgiving as she sings about a rat's nest of feelings — anger, fear, jealousy, desire — over an ex. ""Everything's right, everything's wrong / When you call my name,"" she sings while half-hugging herself. ""And I don't think I can stop the jealousy / When it comes, it comes like waves and I can't breathe.""

Myers follows with a searing version of what she calls ""a very lovely, uplifting song"" from Take Me to the Disco called ""Tear Me to Pieces,"" a frenzied takedown of liars, buried secrets and ""wicked temptations."" She then dials back the fury and indignation to close with a surprising version of ""Running Up That Hill"" by Kate Bush. Myers is a longtime fan, and often gets compared to the British singer. But Myers tells the audience she fell in love with the song for its meaning. ""It's about men and women and the differences between them, and learning to have empathy for each other.""

At the end of it all, standing behind the desk, Myers seems to finally exhale and let go of the fury as she paws playfully at her band, grateful to have gotten through it together.

5gP0-sDkFS8,Phony Ppl: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"March 4, 2019 | Bobby Carter -- ""I wish I could've savored that moment longer,"" Phony Ppl lead singer Elbee Thrie said to me as we rode the elevator down, following the band's Tiny Desk performance. ""I'll never forget this.""

Throughout the set, you see Thrie scan the entire office, taking mental inventory of the entire experience. Phony Ppl is a group that emits a vigorous energy on and off stage. In this case, the spirit was exchanged between the band and the NPR staff from the moment they gathered behind the desk and gave a zesty greeting.

The Brooklynites formed in high school and stand out as one of a handful of R&B bands in the industry that makes eclectic choices in fashion and lyrical narratives. Their fifth full-length, 2015's Yesterday's Tomorrow, was praised for the way the band seamlessly melds jazz, R&B and hip-hop. After consecutive residencies at the Blue Note jazz club in New York City — and a tour with rapper Pusha T — Phony Ppl arrived at the Tiny Desk more refined than ever. They entered the building like they were shot out of cannon, with guitarist Elijah Rawk spending a hefty chunk of his prep time twisting his hair. Right before the cameras started rolling we unsuccessfully scrambled to hide their bag of shea butter. If you look closely, you'll spot it sticking out next to our turntable.

Donning a black turtleneck and sweaters, they invited returning guest Braxton Cook on saxophone to play their four-song set. They opened with ""Compromise,"" a highlight from Yesterday's Tomorrow, and locked into an up-tempo pocket as if it was a second skin. From there, they wove in three more songs, including two from their latest project, mō'zā-ik.

1JuiNySKc1w,Zaytoven: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Feb. 28, 2019 | Rodney Carmichael -- The Lord works in mysterious ways. It might sound cliché, but there's really no better way to describe the circumstances that led to prolific producer Zaytoven's impromptu Tiny Desk.

Last month, Zaytoven arrived at Bob Boilen's desk with a full band in tow with the intent of backing up his Atlanta friend and collaborator Future, who had dropped his latest album, The Wzrd, earlier that day. The plan was to translate the bass-heavy trap sound Zaytoven helped originate to real instruments with Neil Garrard on guitar, Bernard ""TreWay"" Lambert on drums, DJ Spinz and Elena on flute (for what would've been a live version of ""Mask Off"").

After several hours of waiting, with the band all warmed up and ready, word came that Future would be a no-show. So, to our thrill, Zaytoven redeemed the occasion with his own Tiny Desk concert, featuring instrumental versions of a couple of the earliest hits he produced for Future's Beast Mode, the mixtape that helped usher their respective rebirths in 2015.

The Tiny Desk also served as the perfect platform to highlight Zaytoven's own career-long faith walk.

""I wasn't even allowed to listen to this type of music, let alone to be producing it,"" he told me a little over a year ago in the church outside Atlanta where he plays organ every Sunday morning. He was remembering how conflicted he'd once felt as a young producer who'd grown up in the church to be playing his trade for street artists like future trap god Gucci Mane (who Zaytoven would later back on keys during his first visit to the Tiny Desk). ""To be the godfather of the sound, it was almost embarrassing for me, like, 'Hold on, bruh. This ain't really how I was brought up. This ain't really what I do.' I'm a guy that's in the church and I try to lead people more so that way.""

Indeed, there's a long legacy of sanctified musicians who took their gift, honed in the choir stand, and went the secular route, before finally renouncing their fame and returning to their gospel roots. But Zaytoven sidestepped that guilt trip on the way to becoming one of the most celebrated and imitated hip-hop producers of the last decade. Where so many musicians before him fell into a morality trap, Zay found a way to make trap music his ministry.

""God made it where my sound has been heard over the years by millions of people,"" he said. Instead of preaching to the choir, he brought his faith to the trap.

9pTEygixKGY,Natalie Prass: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Feb. 25, 2019 | Joshua Bote -- Full disclosure: We here at NPR Music have decreed Natalie Prass something of a patron saint for roséwave — our groove-laden, pink drink-soaked soundtrack for the summer. So, when the Richmond, Va. artist arrived at the Tiny Desk, it was a cause for celebration, especially amid the January blues that seemed to permeate the NPR Music office. Decked out in matching, cobalt blue outfits (with a matching keyboard stand to boot), Prass and her backing band, comprised of Eric Slick, Alan Parker, Jacob Ungerleider and Brandon Lane, seemed to bring a warm breeze in with them.

There's a sly political bent to Prass' 2018 album, The Future and the Past. Ahead of its release, she said she actually had a different album nearly finished, but scrapped a huge chunk of it after Donald Trump's election, which in turn led her to make this album instead. She highlights this mission statement on the album opener — and first song she performed at the desk — ""Oh My."" It's a track that speaks pointedly about the abject feeling of horror and exhaustion that seeps in when you tune into the news cycle, with bleak lyrics set against bright, dance-y music.

For the unabashedly delightful ""Short Court Style,"" Prass brings on Angelica Garcia and Kenneka Cook, two backup singers who, like Prass, are from Richmond. It's a rare kind of song that celebrates hard-won love in all its intricacies.

Before closing with ""Hot for the Mountain,"" Prass tells the NPR office that ""the song's a little off the beaten path, but, I don't know, it's my favorite."" ""We'll take you on / We can take you on,"" Prass, Garcia and Cook sing in unison, a refrain that resounds emphatically. Her vision was clear: If you want to overcome the times, find strength in numbers.

GP3jS_gFs-g,The Pedrito Martinez Group: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Feb. 20, 2019 | Felix Contreras -- Something happens when you get a chance to see Afro-Cuban percussionist Pedrito Martinez perform. First of all, his smile radiates. It's hard to imagine someone happier than he is to make music in front of people; and as we saw during his turn behind Bob Boilen's desk, he mesmerizes with this almost otherworldly talent on congas. His hands can be a blur because they move so quickly. To the untrained eye, it's hard to see exactly what he is doing to draw out the sounds he does from his drums. I even know a little about playing hand drums and it still doesn't make it easier to fathom his remarkable talent.

Pedrito Martinez has gathered around him musicians who are helping him make the music he hears in his head. As you'll hear, it's full of twists and turns and unexpected stops that resolve into grooves so ferocious it's hard to resist moving your entire body in appreciation.

This particular performance at the Tiny Desk is highlighted by a stunning, unaccompanied conga solo that dazzled both neophytes and long-time fans of Afro-Cuban music.

Go ahead. Watch it repeatedly. It will still amaze each time you watch it.

HwgV6MJneR8,Scott Mulvahill: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Feb. 18, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- Scott Mulvahill has been trying to win the Tiny Desk Contest for each of its four years. He's always been one of our favorites, though he's never been our winner. The double bassist entered his song, ""Begin Againers"" in 2016 and though it wasn't the winning entry, we all loved it so much, I invited him to my desk to perform his extraordinary song. He opened the Tiny Desk with it, only this time he was joined by bandmates Jesse Isley and Josh Shilling who shared vocal harmonies.

Scott Mulvahill honed his craft touring with the great bluegrass mandolin player Ricky Skaggs. ""Playing bluegrass with him is like playing jazz with Miles Davis,"" Scott told the Tiny Desk crowd.


Each of the three tunes Scott Mulvahill played represents different aspects of his creative spirit. He challenges himself to find ways to use the bass as a solo instrument, but its most common role is to accompany others. So he brought his band along for his most rollicking song, ""Gold Plated Lie."" There's a bit of Jackson Browne in his voice and a bit of Paul Simon shows through in his self-reflective words.

For the final tune, the title track from his self-released and current album Himalayas, Scott Mulvahill goes solo, brings out a bow for that bass and we hear a spaciousness I don't often find in the Nashville world he inhabits. This is a perfect introduction to an artist with enormous talent and an artist seeking to stretch his musical world.

wcj2jJOlWls,Mountain Man: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Feb. 13, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- Mountain Man is the perfect band for a Tiny Desk concert. These three women make the most intimate music; and behind the desk, the voices of Amelia Meath, Molly Erin Sarlé and Alexandra Sauser-Monnig were the stars. Adorned by only light, rhythmic acoustic guitar, they sing songs that conjure a simpler life: dogs, friends, moonlight, sunlight, skinny dipping, beach towels and sand.

These dear friends have known each other for more than ten years, since their college days in Vermont. They released their first album in 2010 called Made The Harbor and only recently had a follow-up with the pleasantly surprising, 2018 fall release of Magic Ship.

In the eight years between Mountain Man records, Amelia Meath went on to create Sylvan Esso with Nick Sanborn. Molly Sarlé, meanwhile, was in a meditation center in California — at a cliffside trailer in Big Sur — and worked on her own, beautiful solo album, which is due out soon. And Alexandra Sauser-Monnig worked with Hiss Golden Messenger, released her own music under the name ASM and has a new record coming as well.

But there's a true kinship that happens in this trio. Things get quiet, sometimes funny and playful or, at moments, awkward, especially when they talk about ""savory oatmeal."" Mountain Man is endearing. There's a tour about to happen, and hopefully they won't vanish after that for another eight years. There's no other band like them.

o4Abt48WxkA,Lau Noah: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Feb. 11, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- There's a magical aura that surrounds Lau Noah as she sits behind my desk and embraces her guitar with one foot propped unnaturally high on a stool. As melodies pour from the strings, she sings these words in Spanish: ""On the verge of the soul, there is a red petal, attached to the skins of mortals."" A few lines later in the song she continues, ""a fragile petal that drinks the water of the most cruel stories: children who have never heard a fairytale, lovers who love, dressed in regret."" This is the sort of poetic tale that captured my heart amongst the thousands of entries I watched during the Tiny Desk Contest in 2018. Her song she submitted for the contest is called ""La Realidad.""

Lau Noah's journey as a songwriter and guitarist occurred by happenstance. She was born in Reus, Spain barely a few hours drive from Barcelona. She speaks and now sings in Catalan, Spanish, English and sometimes Hebrew. She'd played piano growing up (never guitar) and left Spain for New York City five years ago while in her late teens.

On a visit to Montreal in 2016, Lau hoped to go to a Patrick Watson concert with friends. But the performance sold out and she was left alone in an apartment while her friends went to the show. Then a snowstorm ensued. The apartment had two guitars and, with nothing else to do, she picked one up and began to play. She wrote her first song, ""Pequitas,"" which means ""Little Freckles."" Now, not too many years later, her creativity on both classical guitar, her narrative poetry and the singing of that poetry make the musician Lau Noah a unique spirit.

Before she played her final song, ""Red Bird,"" at the Tiny Desk, she quoted Spanish writer Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, from his novel Don Quixote: ""When life itself seems lunatic, who knows where madness lies,"" Lau said, reading from her notes. ""Perhaps to be too practical is madness. To surrender dreams is madness. And maddest of all: to see life as it is and not as it should be.""

Lau Noah herself writes the kinds of story-songs that provoke that sort of thought, so we've included translations for you to fully enjoy her vision.

HPpjFtNPnAc,Kurt Vile: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Feb. 6, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- Kurt Vile exudes a casualness at the Tiny Desk in his style and body language that is so unlike most anxious artists who come to play behind my desk. Sure, he's done this Tiny Desk thing before, with Courtney Barnett. But even then, I remember thinking that he's got something else on his mind — and it made me laugh this time around when Kurt played his opening tune, ""Bassackwards,"" and sang these words: ""I was on the beach but I was thinking about the bay / Got to the bay but by then I was far away.""

That idea of being one place and thinking about another, for me, also connects to the way he plays guitar. He seems distracted, yet the complex guitar lines he so nonchalantly plays, along with his musical mate Rob Laakso, are effortlessly beautiful and lyrical.

After they played two new tunes from Kurt Vile's latest record, Bottle It In, Kurt goes solo on an older, self-described ""juvenile"" song from long ago, recently revived during his Courtney Barnett collaboration last year. ""Peeping Tomboy"" has its own schizophrenic issues as Kurt sings, ""I don't wanna change but I don't wanna stay the same / I don't wanna go but I'm runnin' / I don't wanna work but I don't wanna sit around / All day frownin'.""

On the surface, it all can seem just chill. But there's a lot of rumination in these songs — and even when he's gazing into the overhead office lights, I think he got his mind on the stars and the world at large.

BX2bCSoMOOc,Cat Power: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Feb. 4, 2019 | Robin Hilton -- Most artists who play the Tiny Desk are at least a little nervous. Performing in broad daylight in a working office full of staring faces is outside the comfort zones of most people. But Chan Marshall, the unforgettable voice behind Cat Power, seemed especially uneasy when she settled in for her set. Rather than taking center stage, close to the audience, she stepped back and to the side to be closer to her pianist and friend, Erik Paparazzi, for much of the performance. She intermittently steadied herself by resting a hand under her chin while clutching a cup of tea, and she ran through three songs without a break, making her set sound more like a Cat Power medley than a series of distinct songs.

Regardless, the music was arresting and beautifully orchestrated, with simple piano lines and brushed drums backing a voice that could only be hers. Opening with ""Wanderer,"" the title track to Cat Power's latest album, Marshall sang of restless love and yearning with a nod toward motherhood and her 3-year-old son: ""Twist of fate would have me sing at your wedding / With a baby on my mind, now your soul is in between."" She followed with ""Woman,"" another track from Wanderer — originally recorded with Lana Del Rey — before closing with ""The Moon,"" from her 2006 album The Greatest.

As the band played out its final notes, Marshall leaned on her pianist with a look of relief, as if to say, ""We got through it!"" But she was all smiles afterward, lingering long after the performance to chat warmly with friends and fans — particularly a small group of young children who'd attended with their parents. It was a sweetly endearing end to a memorable afternoon.

0wZpheK98Gc,Blood Orange: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Jan. 29, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- This Blood Orange Tiny Desk is a beautifully conceived concert showing off the craft and care that has made Devonté Hynes a groundbreaking producer and songwriter. It's a distillation of themes found on Dev Hynes' fourth album as Blood Orange, titled Negro Swan. Themes of identity, both sexual and racial, through the eyes of a black East Londoner (now living in New York) run through this album and concert. Dev Hynes is a composer who fits as comfortably in the worlds of R&B, gospel and electronics as he does in the classical world of someone like Philip Glass.

The opening song at the Tiny Desk, ""By Ourselves,"" features Dev Hynes on piano, Jason Arce on saxophone, Eva Tolkin and Ian Isiah on vocals along with a powerful spoken word performance by Ashlee Haze. Ashlee's story is a tale of finding herself and her identity in the words and music of Missy Elliott when she was, in Ashlee's own words, an eight-year old, ""fat black girl from Chicago"" who discovered ""she could dance until she felt pretty"" and ""be a woman playing a man's game.""

""Jewelry,"" the second song performed, welcomes Mikey Freedom Hart on piano while Dev moves on to electric guitar and vocals reminiscent of a languid Jimi Hendrix, with soul-baring lyrics of pride. The group then offers a rendition of ""Holy Will,"" inspired by the Detroit gospel group The Clark Sisters, as singer Ian Isiah takes this song of praise to a whole new level.

Blood Orange ends as a trio on the final song, ""Dagenham Dream."" Eva Tolkin and Ian Isiah are on vocals; Dev Hynes works an organ sound while singing about being beaten and bullied as a school kid in his hometown of Dagenham in east London. The power of each of these songs is magnified by the way Blood Orange has woven this performance together. He's a rich, rare and caring talent we first met 11 years ago in a grassy field in Austin, Texas back when he still used the moniker Lightspeed Champion. Now his thoughts are deeper, his message of finding one's place in this world more deep-seated, with a clarity few artists ever achieve.

pbSvaHuDYKA,Stella Donnelly: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Jan. 22, 2019 | Robin Hilton -- When Stella Donnelly showed up for this Tiny Desk performance with just her guitar in hand, she immediately won the office over with her broad smile, warmth and good-natured sense of humor. It's the kind of easy-going, open-hearted spirit that makes her one of the most affable live performers you'll see. While there's no doubting her sincerity, she's also got a disarming way of making her often dark and brutal songs a little easier to take in.

For this set, she performed entirely new — and, as of this writing, unreleased — songs from her upcoming full-length debut, Beware of the Dogs. Opening with the title cut, Donnelly smiled cheerfully through the entire performance while reflecting on the horrors that often lurk beneath the surface of seemingly idyllic lives. ""This street is haunted like a beast that doesn't know its face is frightening to behold,"" she sings. ""All the painted little gnomes, smiling in a line, trying to get your vote.""

She follows with ""U Owe Me"" — a song that's both comical and eviscerating as she describes a horrible boss she once worked for at a pub in Australia — before closing with what Donnelly describes as ""a more run-of-the-mill breakup song"" called ""Allergies.""

Surprisingly, Donnelly chose not to play any of the songs that have gotten her to where she is in her young career — songs like 2017's ""Boys Will Be Boys"" or last year's ""Talking,"" two savagely frank examinations of misogyny and violence that earned her the reputation for being a fearless and uncompromising songwriter. But the new material demonstrates that her unflinching perspective and potent voice is only getting stronger.

Beware of the Dogs is out March 18 via Secretly Canadian.

HQrZmIm64NM,Nate Wood - fOUR: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Jan. 16, 2019 | Colin Marshall -- Nate Wood says he only wishes he had more limbs. He made the comment in an interview NPR partner station WBGO, noting only the limitations of his physical body, rather than his ability to multitask. In his latest project, Nate Wood - fOUR, Wood's brain splits attention between four synthesizers, an electric bass and a drum kit, all while singing about futurism. He's his own engineer and roadie, too, who drove himself from Brooklyn to our D.C. office and quietly set up his gear, alone.

His setup is made possible through a long road of ergonomic trial-and-error that includes the precise height of the keyboards, the instrument sequencing and a wearable microphone to minimize physical demand and maximize as many possibilities as he can fit within arm's reach of a drum throne. It's a feat of ingenuity, especially considering Wood plays all of fOUR's tunes in one take. No backing tracks. No overdubs.

But while it's a thrill to see the multi-instrumentalist wizardry here, his music is perhaps best appreciated with eyes closed. Nate Wood pulls us into an industrial, neon dystopia with tunes that stand alone as headphone music without the accompanying visuals, meticulously crafted and with precise execution. This isn't novelty music. You're hearing (and seeing) a mastermind songwriter and mad scientist at work. Just look at that lab coat!

YSrJ4amfO84,Aaron Lee Tasjan: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Jan. 15, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- Aaron Lee Tasjan arrived at the Tiny Desk in his fashionable ascot and mustard-colored shirt, sporting reflective, red, rounded sunglasses and mutton chops. As he warmed up, the sound of the middle-and-late 1960s came through his seagreen, Gorsuch 12-string guitar while his voice felt both familiar and fresh. This buoyant, East Nashville-via-Ohio soul and his fabulous band have a knack for channeling Paul McCartney, Tom Petty and The Kinks.

Aaron Lee Tasjan's love for this older sound infuses Karma For Cheap, his recent album, with an optimistic THC-veiled sentiment — one that can be heard on ""Songbird,"" his opening number here at the Tiny Desk. ""There's a songbird singing, I'm laying on the floor. Something feels right that has never felt right before.""

These are songs of encouragement, and the final tune in this Tiny set, ""Set You Free,"" invokes that sentiment in plain-spoken language: ""You gotta change your mind, you gotta plant the seed and let it set you free."" All the while, drummer Seth Earnest, guitarist Brian Wright and bassist Tommy Scifres seemingly channeled their love of David Bowie's 1972 song, ""The Jean Genie"" (a song mixed in Nashville), in its rhythms and vibes. It's all in good fun, exploring the ages and traversing music history. Aaron Lee Tasjan has a knack for making music that is timeless, as good music wants to do.

SA09W7orJCE,Carolina Eyck and Clarice Jensen: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Jan. 11, 2019 | Tom Huizenga -- How do you play an instrument you never physically touch? Watch Carolina Eyck. She's the first to bring a theremin to the Tiny Desk. The early electronic instrument with the slithery sound was invented almost 100 years ago by Leon Theremin, a Soviet scientist with a penchant for espionage. It looks like a simple black metal box with a couple of protruding antennae, but to play the theremin like Eyck does, with her lyrical phrasing and precisely ""fingered"" articulation, takes a special kind of virtuosity.

""I'm really playing air,"" she tells the Tiny Desk audience. ""I don't touch anything while I play."" The position of the hands influences electromagnetic fields to produce pitch and volume. Recognized as one of today's preeminent theremin specialists, Eyck writes her own compositions, such as the pulsating ""Delphic"" which opens the set, and she's got big shot composers writing theremin concertos for her.

Joining Eyck for this two-musician-in-one Tiny Desk is cellist Clarice Jensen. When she's not making gorgeous, drone-infused albums like last year's For This From That Will be Filled, Jensen directs one of today's leading new music outfits, ACME, the American Contemporary Music Ensemble. ""Three Leos,"" composed by Jensen, offers her masterful art of looping the cello into symphonic layers of swirling, submerged choirs with a wistful tune soaring above.

The two musicians close with ""Frequencies,"" a piece jointly composed specifically for this Tiny Desk performance. Amid roiling figures in cello and melodies hovering in the theremin, listen closely for a wink at the NPR Morning Edition theme music.

UU5a8xIiuWc,Buddy: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Jan. 9, 2019 | Rodney Carmichael -- When Buddy, a preacher's son from Compton, turns to me with eyebrows raised on the elevator ride inside NPR's corporate headquarters, it's hard to tell if the question that comes next is in preparation for his performance or pure provocation.

""Can we smoke in here?!"" he asks with a grin that elicits stifled laughter from his bandmates and a few newsroom journalists along for the ride. It's a blunt request, even from a self-professed ""weed connoisseur,"" and it kicks off one of the most dramatic Tiny Desks in recent memory.

If 2018 signaled the year of disruption in rap — with a shortlist of vets and newcomers trolling their way to the top of the charts — it was dominated by a groundswell of emerging voices who found more creative means to make their mark. Buddy's anticipated full-length debut Harlan & Alondra, named for the cross streets where he lived as a child, placed him among the better company (and on NPR's Best Rap Albums Of 2018). The same soulful hybrid of rapping and singing that compelled Pharrell to sign him as a teenager found Buddy stretching L.A. hip-hop beyond its typical gangsta narrative, while dancing with his dreams and shaking off his demons.

But sometimes being a nonconformist works both ways. So when Buddy proceeded to fire up a blunt midway through his set, we had to stop the show and ask him to put it out before re-recording his song, ""Hey Up There."" (Smoking is not allowed on NPR property.) The performance was still lit, owing in part to Buddy's Baptist bona fides and his hood's close proximity to Hollywood. He grew up a singing in the choir and watching his dad work the crowd from the pulpit. He's also an alumni of actress Wendy Raquel Robinson's Amazing Grace Conservatory, an L.A. program known for steeping inner-city kids in the performing arts. Between the two, he earned his dramatic chops early. ""I'm so used to being in front of an audience of people,"" he tells me, ""just doing my thing and not really caring about it."" He's definitely not afraid of the camera. In fact, he's one of the rare Tiny Desk guests who stares directly into it throughout much of his set, performing for the camera in the most literal sense.

While onstage drama kept Buddy a safe distance from the streets, he still experienced the kind of coming-of-age struggles that shaped his personal and political outlook. On ""Real Life S**t,"" the opening song on his album and the last song in his Tiny Desk set, he conveys that reality with raw sentiment for the sitting President in lyrics straight from the record. It's that freedom of expression, from unbridled joy to middle-finger attitude, that makes him a provocateur in the purest sense. ""If you don't like it, you weird,"" he tells me about his music before acknowledging the unintended irony behind his characterization: ""Yeah, I am weird. So I guess being weird doesn't matter.""

Spektral Quartet: Tiny Desk Concert,"Jan. 4, 2019 | Felix Contreras -- Saxophonist Miguel Zenón is a big thinker — that much is clear from his recorded output, with its deep and inspiring connection to the folk traditions of his native Puerto Rico. But you also get that sense from his turn behind the Tiny Desk, where we can watch the concentration on his face and those of his adventurous band, the Spektral Quartet. This is life-affirming music with curious twists and turns, expertly performed by amazingly talented musicians.

There are two ways to marvel at the stunning unison playing that comes about three-quarters of the way through ""Milagrosa."" First, listen with your eyes closed. The notes cascade at a such a fast clip, it can leave you breathless. Now, watch with your eyes open: It's a joy to see Zenón and his band read the notes from the page, at times sneaking in visual cues with smiles just below the surface. It must be such a pleasure to make music like this.

DcnMDkX1PZg,Amy Grant: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Dec. 17, 2018 | Lars Gotrich -- Growing up in the '90s, there was never a Christmas without Amy Grant's music. Home for Christmas, in particular, was a favorite around our household, its string-swept nostalgia wrapped around the family den like a warm blanket and a plate of cookies. So when I invited the Nashville pop singer to perform our annual holiday Tiny Desk, I had to bring my mom.

You could almost map Grant's fabulous four-decade career by those Christmas records (four in total, five if you count her reading of Jimmy Webb's The Animals' Christmas with Art Garfunkel). In them, you not only hear an artist progress — from '80s synth-pop to lush string arrangements to a contemporary Nashville sound — but as a person, as her own feelings and faith surrounding the season evolve with a mixture of melancholy and cheer.

""As I've gotten older, sometimes I've realized the bravest thing you can do at Christmas is go home,"" she tells the Tiny Desk audience after performing ""To Be Together,"" from 2016's cozy, yet lived-in Tennessee Christmas. ""Sometimes the bravest thing you can do is open the door and welcome everybody back.""

And that's when it all comes home for Amy Grant. ""Tennessee Christmas,"" written 35 years ago, takes on new meaning here — this was the first time she's performed the song since her father died this year. You see her eyes glisten, and her voice catch on the final ""tender Tennessee Christmas,"" everyone feeling that wistful tenderness and offering some back in return.

To shake out her sadness, Grant dons reindeer antlers (generously provided by someone at NPR because of course someone at NPR keeps festive wear on hand) and dashes through a delightful version of ""Jingle Bells."" Happiest of holidays from all of us at NPR Music!

Tennessee Christmas is available now.

0pzIzOgIGyg,Harold López-Nussa Trio: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Dec. 14, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- Cuba is known as much for their pianists as their percussionists — you'll see why with this performance.

Cuban pianist Harold López-Nussa and his trio open their performance with some help from a recording of famed Afro-Cuban folkloric singer Lázaro Ros. Ros is both a musical and spiritual guide for this performance; the trio dug deep into the ritual music of santeria for inspiration with ""Eleguá,"" a tribute to one of the Afro-Cuban deities. (Special mention should be made of Harold's brother, Ruy López-Nussa, on drums, and bassist Gastón Joya, who both fill the spaces between the beats while elegantly leaving breathing room within the performances.)

""Preludio"" demonstrates the telepathic connection between these musicians, while subtlety and emotion are not sacrificed for the slower tempo.

""Hialeah"" has the recognizable piano riffs — called guajeos — that we can recognize as originating with Cuban dance music, but the trio deftly melds that rhythm to a complex jazz exploration, without compromising its danceable pulse.

hxxcEzM8r-4,H.E.R.: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Dec. 12, 2018 | Bobby Carter -- It's been said that you only get one chance to make a first impression. In H.E.R.'s case, you get two. She stunned us as a special guest for Daniel Ceasar's Tiny Desk concert earlier this year, in an appearance that showcased her vocal mastery. That earned her an invite to play again, front-and-center. She attacked her second go 'round with more fervor than the first, highlighting her skills as a multi-instrumentalist, maneuvering between acoustic and electric guitars, then the Fender Rhodes.

While H.E.R. stands for ""Having Everything Revealed,"" she's an artist who's built her reputation on a certain degree of anonymity. The cover art for her debut, 2016 EP, H.E.R. Volume 1, shows a woman's silhouette over a blue backdrop. Her visuals never provide the audience a clear shot of her face and her signature accessory for every outfit is a pair of large, dark sunglasses.

As fans collectively squinted to get a better view, she delivered more projects. Another EP, H.E.R. Vol 2, came in 2017, followed months later by H.E.R. which combined songs from both volumes with a handful of new songs. The latter earned her five nominations for 2019's Grammy Awards, including Album Of The Year and Best New Artist Of The Year. She was born Gabriella Wilson to a Filipino mother and Black father. She first attracted the spotlight as a child prodigy, eventually signing a record contract when she was 14-years old. At 21, she's yet to release her debut LP.

There were two standout moments during her Tiny Desk set. One came at the midway point of her biggest hit so far, ""Focus."" When the instruments dropped out and background vocalists Ajanee Hambrick and Malik Spence chimed in with their lush harmonies, the audience melted. The second came when her focus was interrupted by a charming and sincere expression of gratitude for the Tiny Desk platform. For a split second it appears as though she's about to remove those sunglasses. ""Not saying that I'm your favorite artist, but maybe me being here today says a lot.""

ALUKDkOxVPo,Wu-Tang Clan: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Dec. 5, 2018 | Abby O'Neill -- The Wu-Tang Clan gathered at the Tiny Desk to commemorate the 25 years since the release of the group's landmark album Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers). With more than 60 albums between the various members, The Clan's combined discography left them spoiled for choice when it came to narrowing down the set list for their performance. The result was an extended, 20-minute medley of songs from across the group's iconic catalog.

The retrospective mashup of Wu classics started with the posse cut ""Triumph."" Backed by strings (The Green Project), the performance morphed into an old-school cipher as Raekwon, Inspectah Deck and Cappadonna traded verses with Masta Killa and U-God. Young Dirty Bastard, son of original member Ol' Dirty Bastard, provided a spark of energy reminiscent of his father.

At one moment in the performance, RZA — the mastermind behind the Clan's success — omits some explicit lyrics from earlier in his Wu journey, while alluding to the #MeToo movement mid-cadence. But it's the poetic interlude, read from his phone at the close of the set, that better reflects his current state of consciousness. ""Wu-Tang is for the kids!"" RZA proclaims. The core of the group began as childhood pals in Staten Island in the early '90s, when the crew's creative philosophy was influenced by everything from Saturday afternoon kung-fu flicks to the spiritual wisdom of the Five-Percent Nation. As they've matured, Raekwon still describes the Wu as ""superfriends."" They've allowed each other to grow and form various offshoots in recent years. But when the Wu-Tang Clan comes together, they still bring a love for the culture and for their brotherhood.

cfhzD3QWipU,Dirty Projectors: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Dec. 4, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- Sometimes the world turns obstacles into magic. When Dirty Projectors let us know they couldn't make it to the band's Tiny Desk performance until late in the day, we were sad because the clocks had recently turned back for the fall, we knew that our beautiful, natural light would be gone and it'd be dark. But with candles left over from a late-winter day performance by Rhye — and some LED panels and spots — we were set up right on time for David Longstreth to sing these words: ""The sky has darkened, earth turned to hell / Some said a light got shined where darkness dwelt / So I won't cry or collapse, overwhelmed / Time like a song just might rhyme with itself."" That song, ""Right Now,"" and the other two tracks from Dirty Projectors' brilliant 2018 release Lamp Lit Prose, felt more poignant than ever.

Dirty Projectors' eighth album is often loving and forgiving. It's full of the quirks of production and rhythm and rhyme that had me fall for their music when I first heard it about a dozen years ago. What's wonderful about this Tiny Desk Concert is watching these talented people arrange this complicated music without amplification and seeing the joy on their face when it all worked out. Obstacles into magic indeed.

_NIFz8wRvMs,Joey Alexander: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Nov. 30, 2018 | Lauren Onkey -- When a baby grand piano rolls into the office for a Tiny Desk concert, you expect something special. But none of us could have imagined what it's like to see 15-year old Joey Alexander play that piano with such mastery. The thing is, when you see him play live, you quickly forget his age and get lost in the intense focus of his performance. Alexander and his stellar supporting cast — Reuben Rogers on bass and Kendrick Scott on drums — form a tight trio, locking eyes as Alexander's compositions unfold. The relaxed, seasoned veterans looked thrilled to be playing with Alexander at the Tiny Desk, and he was clearly inspired playing with them. The crowd was both mesmerized and humbled by the memories of what they were doing at 15.

Born in Indonesia, Alexander learned to play by listening to his father's jazz albums. When he was just 10-years old, Wynton Marsalis invited him to play at a Jazz at Lincoln Center gala, and the young Alexander set the jazz world buzzing. He made his mark covering classics by Thelonious Monk and John Coltrane, but he's now recording and performing more of his own compositions. He showcased that original work during his Tiny Desk performance. Alexander's vigorously rhythmic playing was playful in the opening ""Eclipse"" (from his latest album of the same name), which he described as ""spontaneous playing."" ""Bali,"" also from Eclipse, followed, while ""City Lights"" (from his 2016 album Countdown) closed a set that ranks among the year's finest jazz performances at the Tiny Desk.

_RT5tZtCAD0,The Innocence Mission: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Nov. 28, 2018 | Lars Gotrich -- Some days, you can hear a go-go band revving up the party or a pianist busting the keys wide open, luring NPR staff to the Tiny Desk. But in the hushed performances, your ears need to lean into the sound so that your entire being can take in every fingerpick of string and each hummed melody. The Innocence Mission, ever the most careful cultivators of quiet, encouraged us to come closer, to discover the ""thing beautiful enough"" in the moment it's delivered.

The trio — now three decades into its existence — bookends this performance with two songs from 2018's Sun on the Square. ""Green Bus"" and ""Light of Winter"" thread the long and winding needle of Karen Peris' evocative words with her husband Don Peris' decorative-but-nuanced guitar and Mike Bitts' deft bass lines. In some of my favorite lyrics of the year, Karen Peris tangles the tender and the tempestuous:

And what could I bring you,
now in the meantime?
Fruit from the sunlight,
quartz from the bay?
And where will I find this,
perfect and wondrous?
I look into shops,
I slip into rain.

Between those newer songs, The Innocence Mission plays ""Tomorrow on the Runway,"" the opening cut from 2003's Befriended, which Iron & Wine recently covered in Stephanie Laing's film Irreplaceable You. Nursing a small cold, Peris' voice slightly breaks when she sings, ""Did you still leave the darkness without me? You're always miles ahead"" — but the humbling effect, however unintended, lingers in your being.

4ORnkWCeplg,dvsn: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Nov. 19, 2018 | Sidney Madden -- When dvsn visited NPR for this Tiny Desk concert, it reminded me of the first time I saw them two years ago in New York City. They decided to wash the desk in vibrant blue, purple and orange lighting, brought in by dvsn's team to make the space feel like a concert hall. And while the audience at NPR was almost as densely packed as that NYC venue, it felt much like my live introduction to the group — grandiose in presentation, but at the same time, deliberately intimate in delivery.

With a four-piece band and three pristine backup vocalists for support, singer Daniel Daley flexed his falsetto pipes and a shiny gold grill, running through a sampler of fan-favorites about breaking up, making up and trying to move on. The short-and-sweet set is an example of the kind of audible acrobatics you don't often hear at contemporary R&B shows anymore.

Though it's easy to mistake dvsn as simply the stage moniker of Daley, the act is really a duo comprised of the singer and Grammy Award-winning producer Nineteen85, the (almost) secret weapon behind the boards. Together, the Toronto-based duo has released two albums so far — 2016's Sept. 5th and 2017's Morning After. And on the day of the Tiny Desk concert, while Daley gleamed in the spotlight behind dark shades, Nineteen85 hung back in the audience to, as always, play the role of humble maestro.

OS48Lp34Zic,boygenius: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Nov. 16, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- The group is new, but all of the members of boygenius — Julien Baker, Lucy Dacus and Phoebe Bridgers — are Tiny Desk Concert alumae. In fact, Julien has been behind my desk twice before. So when the usual nerve-racking session was over and I shouted out, ""So, is it any easier the second or third time?"" I had to laugh when I got a resounding ""No!"" from all of them. The notion of playing in broad daylight, in an office, without having your voice coming out of a PA and with an audience close enough to touch is not only intensely intimate but also intimidating. That's not only true to these three, newly collaborating, under-25-year-olds. It was also true of, say, Ralph Stanley (who was older than their ages combined) when he sang a cappella behind my desk.

But what came through as these three heartfelt singers performed was the strength of their songs. My first attraction to each of them as artists was the songwriting. In fact, the title track to Julien Baker's first album, Sprained Ankle, is what got me to a show of hers early in 2016, which introduced me to the opening act, Lucy Dacus. (You can hear them tell their tale on an upcoming All Songs Considered.) Boygenius only has six total tunes, all from their just-released, self-titled EP, and here they perform half of that catalog. What you get at the Tiny Desk is a frailer version of these more fleshed-out songs from a band that is likely quite temporary.

For their closing tune at the Tiny Desk, ""Ketchum, ID,"" Julien, Phoebe and Lucy each take a verse. Lucy's verse ends the song with the line, ""Let's dissolve the band, move to Idaho."" And the chorus to the song, in stunning harmony, echoes the mileage of the lifestyle, how they live and how they met: ""I am never anywhere / Anywhere I go / When I'm home I'm never there / Long enough to know.""

This trio is a special gift to us all in 2018.

UPQsEoYHekg,Bernie And The Believers Feat. Essence: Tiny Desk Concert,"Nov. 12, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- The story of Bernie and the Believers is the most powerful I've ever come across at the Tiny Desk. It's about a beautiful act of compassion that ultimately led to this performance, and left me and my coworkers in tears.

I discovered the music of Bernie Dalton among the thousands of Tiny Desk Contest entries we received earlier this year. The band's singer, Essence Goldman, had submitted the entry and shared Bernie's story. You should hear her tell it in her own words at the Tiny Desk (and I choke up every time I hear it). In summary she said that a few years ago, Bernie — a father, a songwriter and a musician in his mid-forties, and an avid surfer with a day job as a pool cleaner — answered an ad she had posted offering voice lessons. Essence was a performer trying to manage her own career as a single mom, and Bernie was trying to improve his talents.

Bernie drove 90-minutes from Santa Cruz to San Francisco, eagerly showing up early to his voice lessons with Essence. But not long after they started working together, Bernie lost his voice. They didn't think much of a it at first, but then things got worse. He had trouble swallowing and eating. Essence encouraged Bernie to see a doctor and after some tests Bernie Dalton was diagnosed with bulbar-onset ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease. He began to lose the use of his hands and, along with it, the ability to play guitar.

With a prognosis of only one-to-three years left to live, Essence offered to raise money so that Bernie and his daughter could travel together. But what Bernie wanted more than anything was to make a record. So he asked Essence to not just be his voice teacher, but his voice. From there, they got to business. Essence pulled together a team of producers, engineers and musicians, while Bernie guided the creative direction through gestures and a dry-erase board. They wrote and recorded a new song every day. Their first single, ""Unusual Boy,"" was the one they included in their 2018 Tiny Desk Contest entry.

Now Bernie's friends have gathered here in Washington, D.C. to perform his songs. All the while, Bernie watched and listened from his hospital bed on the West coast, communicating with us in a live video feed through his eye-gaze device. What you are about to witness is the ultimate act of love: Essence sacrificing her own musical ambitions to fulfill the dreams of Bernie Dalton. Through tragedy there was beauty.

vGQrBz4YqzI,Half Waif: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Nov. 9, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- Midway through Half Waif's Tiny Desk, singer Nandi Rose Plunkett stops to let us all know that this particular Half Waif show is extra special. ""So today we're actually 'Full Waif,' because I am joined by my dear friends,"" she says. ""These are all musicians who have played with the band Half Waif over the past five years, but we've never all played together until now! So thanks for the opportunity to get 'Full Waif' together.""

The band, more often a trio, with Nandi singing her songs and playing keyboards, with Zack Levine on drums and Adan Carlo bass synth and guitar, put out their third album Lavender earlier in the year. The three intimate songs performed here, all from that album, are stripped to their essence. So when they closed with ""Salt Candy,"" the line ""I wanted to be carried in my mother's arms / I wanted to be buried in my mother's arms,"" in this setting and with the spare punctuation of electronic drums and textures, sitting alongside Nandi's voice, was particularly chilling.

I've always found a sense of solitude in Half Waif's music and their lead-off performance of ""Lavender Burning,"" with its opening line, ""Staring out into the shifting darkness / Tryin' to give a name to the place where my heart is,"" reinforces my love for their peaceful, almost backwoods calm.

C3z7edMwGao,Pedro The Lion: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Nov. 8, 2018 | Lars Gotrich -- ""I've made music under many brand names. It was a dumb idea,"" David Bazan jokes during his performance at the Tiny Desk, in his own particularly reflective and self-deprecating way. You can find that music filed under his previous ""brands"" or incarnations as Headphones, Lo Tom (with TW Walsh and members of Starflyer 59) and his own name. But here Bazan returns to the one that first gave him voice: Pedro the Lion, a name he now says he intends to keep.

No matter how dark or disastrous, there's always been an undercurrent of grace to the music of David Bazan. Even in his most righteous anger, empathy seeps through. ""When They Really Get to Know You They Will Run"" opens the Tiny Desk set with sparse instrumentation — Erik Walters on guitar, Bazan on bass, Sean Lane on brushes and snare — not unlike performances of yesteryear, when slyly clever-yet-quiet riffs put Bazan's sardonic wit front and center. Twenty years after being released on Pedro the Lion's debut album, It's Hard to Find a Friend, the cheeky song about hypocrisy (exposing the toxic male gaze through double standards of beauty) still rings painfully true.

Bazan then introduces ""Yellow Bike,"" from Pedro the Lion's forthcoming Phoenix, as ""cheeky in a different way."" With a hiccuping rhythm that rolls like a Tom Petty joint down uncertain roads, Bazan recounts the thrill found in childhood bike rides, and the somewhat terrifying price of freedom that accompanies onset adulthood.

So what about all of those songs released as ""David Bazan"" from the past decade? Those are now Pedro the Lion songs! That includes ""Kept Secrets,"" originally released on 2016's Blanco. Its slow, doleful sway closed out the Tiny Desk with a hidden hope washed in snow, ""white with ocean foam.""

Phoenix comes out Jan. 18 via Polyvinyl Records.

f_dSlxgD2Fo,Nicholas Payton Trio: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Nov. 2, 2018 | Suraya Mohamed -- He should have been exhausted, but instead played the Tiny Desk with incredible stamina, holding a single trumpet note that lasted longer than most people can hold their breath. In the days just before this performance, Nicholas Payton played at the Joy of Jazz Festival in Johannesburg, South Africa, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, then Santiago, Chile and, finally, New York City. A member of his team drove them the four hours from NYC so he could nap in the car and be ready to play.

Payton dazzled the audience, simultaneously playing his trumpet and a Fender Rhodes. It's his signature, resonant sound. With the rest of his trio - the rhythmic precision of drummer Jonathan Barber and bassist Ben Williams - Payton's genius virtuosity captivated both faithful fans and anyone in the NPR crowd just discovering his music for the first time.

All three compositions in this set are from Payton's 2017 album, Afro-Caribbean Mixtape. ""It is often said that New Orleans is the northernmost region of the Caribbean,"" says Payton on his website. ""Africa is the source of all rhythms. The Afro-Caribbean Mixtape is a study of how those rhythms were dispersed by way of the Middle Passage throughout Cuba, Haiti, and Puerto Rico, then funneled through the mouthpiece of New Orleans to North America and the rest of the world.""

Racial constructs are notably relevant in the last tune, ""Jazz Is A Four-Letter Word,"" which was inspired by the autobiography of drummer and activist Max Roach. You can even hear Roach's sampled voice, fused into the infectious groove, a narrative of black consciousness on display. Ideology aside, the music was on point and the audience couldn't help but sing and clap as the trio took us out on a soulful rhythmic vamp.

tCrLnfwX088,Liniker e os Caramelows: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Oct. 29, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- Watching this performance is to witness a spell being cast, note-by-note. Liniker e os Caramelows (Liniker and the Caramelows) are from Brazil but steeped in the tradition of soul from here in the U.S. They started their turn behind the desk with the ballad ""Calmô,"" a testament to the power of slow songs dripping with soulful emotion. It was a bold statement of just who they are as a band and what they stand for.

You have to go back to the co-mingling of jazz and Brazilian music in the late 1950s to appreciate the affinity our two countries have had for each other musically. Lead vocalist Liniker Barros has obviously done her share of listening to soul singers and she effortlessly slides from lower registers to an emotional falsetto, though the Tiny Desk space did restrict the kind of vigorous floor show of dancing and moving from all the band members that I've seen at the bigger live performances they've done.

Liniker and the band shook things up to high-gear, Brazilian funk on the second part of ""Tua,"" complete with a mid-song, church-revival breakdown, featuring tenor sax. ""Remonta"" displayed the band's flexibility as they moved from ballad to a reggae bridge, eventually exploding into a majestic African-based Candomblé rhythmic finish.

This performance catches Liniker e os Caramelows as they spiral upwards toward wider acclaim and recognition. Seeing them this close helps to understand just how they cast their musical magic on their audiences.

KfDY0eodPMU,Jim James: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Oct. 26, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- A single voice can send a powerful message - and that's just what Jim James did at the Tiny Desk, with just his voice and an acoustic guitar. His lead-off song, ""I'm Amazed,"" comes from My Morning Jacket's 2008 album Evil Urges. It's a prophetic song in many ways - it speaks not only of a divided nation and the need for justice but also to the beauty in the life and plight of others. It's something Jim James would find greater appreciation for after he fell from a stage at a My Morning Jacket concert, just three days before Evil Urges was to be released, sustaining life-threatening injuries. It would be a life-changing event and the inspiration for his first solo album years later, in 2013, Regions of Light and Sound of God.

Jim James' second song at the Tiny Desk, ""Same Old Lie,"" comes from an album he released just days before the 2016 Presidential election. The lyrics take on a deeper meaning now, just days before the 2018 elections. ""It's the same old lie you been reading about / Bleeding out - now who's getting cheated out? / You best believe it's the silent majority / If you don't vote it's on you, not me.""

His closing tune, in what I think of as a purposeful trilogy for these political times, is from two albums he's released this year, Uniform Distortion and Uniform Clarity. The albums contain the same songs, performed with his blistering electric guitar on one and on the other, as here, acoustically. ""Over and Over"" is perfectly suited for ""The Future of Voting 2018"" tour he's embarked on. After 20-some odd years of putting out music, Jim James is full of fervor and compassion for others as he sings, ""How can we make / The same mistakes / and still carry on / Living the same we did yesterday / Have we learned nothing at all?""

VERVVrzLSuo,Cautious Clay: Tiny Desk Concert,"Oct. 24, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- He came to the Tiny Desk with friends, a lot of friends. In fact, Josh Karpeh, best known in the music world as Cautious Clay, put together a backing vocal ensemble of friends he's known since his days as a music student at The George Washington University here in D.C. And so, with five singers - along with a drummer, keyboardist and a bassist - Cautious Clay brought a warm, thoughtful and chill vibe to the Tiny Desk.

I was first struck by Cautious Clay's charismatic spirit at a sold-out show in D.C. earlier this year. And while I was already captivated by his seemingly effortless singing, with hints of James Blake and Sampha, when he picked up his saxophone and, later, a flute, I was won over by his rich sound-palette. Here at the Tiny Desk, Cautious Clay opens with ""Cold War,"" a song that I interpret to be about commitments within relationships. The line, ""In it for the monetary growth and power / But we divided at the bottom of this whiskey sour"" shows the humor and insight that I love in his lyrics.

There's good reason why I'm so certain that this little-known artist will be well-known in the coming year: he's a bright talent, exploring music with a curiosity and invention that is genuine, without pretense and with intentions that aren't aimed at fame but rather meant for friends.

""Cold War""
""Call Me""
""Stolen Moments""

Musicians
Josh Karpeh (Guitar/vocals/Saxphone/flute), Chris Kyle (Guitar/bass guitar), Francesco Alessi (Drums), Eric Lane (Keyboard/keybass), Sanna Taskinen (vocals), Marianne Khattar (vocals), Sam East (vocals), Claire Miller (vocals), Michael Ferrier (vocals)

UlAa0dc-E4w,Chromeo: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Oct. 19, 2018 | Josh Rogosin -- Self-proclaimed ""Funklordz"" Chromeo played with a live band for the first time at the Tiny Desk. The duo usually performs their live shows over backing tracks with shimmering chrome guitars and keyboards mounted on mannequin lady legs. David Macklovitch (Dave 1) and Patrick Gemayel (P-Thugg) met when they were 15 while growing up in Montreal and have been cranking out the electro-funk jams ever since. On being Canadian, P-Thugg announced in his robot voice ""it's very, very cold"" to which Dave 1 quipped, ""it's cold... free healthcare."" At first glance, their Jewish and Arab partnership might seem unlikely. But their signature sounds are undeniably infectious, epitomized by P-Thugg's Talk Box - an instrument that transforms his vocals into robotic sounds.

With a nod to DC's own funky go-go music scene of the '70s, their band was outfitted in go-go-style matching uniforms custom embroidered with the words ""Funk Lordz"". The breakdown at the end of the song ""Don't Sleep"" was a fitting tribute to NPR's hometown, Washington, D.C.

The Philadelphia based line-up included keyboardist Eugene ""Man-Man"" Roberts and legendary percussionists Rashid Williams and Aaron Draper who have played with the likes of John Legend, Jill Scott, The Roots, Adele, and Erykah Badu. Eric Watley filled out the low end with Dave 1 on electric guitar and P-Thugg on bass, rounding out the sextet.

The band played three tracks from their fifth album, Head Over Heels. They tossed in the backbeat-thumping ""Jealous (I Ain't With It)"" from 2014's White Women in a medley that opened the energized set. Listening to Chromeo is a joyous affair. Watching them get funky with a stellar band behind The Desk for the very first time, it's impossible to sit still.

Set List
""Count Me Out/Jealous (I Ain't With It)""
""Don't Sleep""
""Must've Been""

qOxCOMtJbC8,Alfredo Rodríguez Trio: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Oct. 18, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- Cuban pianist Alfredo Rodríguez gave our office audience a very quick lesson on why pianists from that island nation are so impressive: they treat the piano as the percussion instrument it is. Rodríguez immediately let fly with an intense flurry of notes that were as melodic as they were rhythmic.

The mash up of European lyricism and Afro-Cuban percussion is at the heart of the Cuban piano tradition and it is very present in the first song. It wasn't long before Rodríguez dug deep into rapid-fire syncopation along with drummer Michael Olivera and guitarist/ bassist Munir Hossn.

Iconic music producer/composer Quincy Jones heard Rodríguez during a performance at a European jazz festival and took him under this wing, eventually signing him to Jones' management company. When you listen to the expansive and lyrical exploration of the second song in this Tiny Desk set, ""Bloom,"" it's easy to hear what captured Jones' attention.

The West Africa-based Yoruba spiritual tradition, commonly known as Santeria, infuses so much of Cuban daily life in music and Rodríguez closes with his take on the music dedicated to the Orisha Yemaya, the goddess of the ocean and all waters. The song's melody is a derivation of the song associated to Yemaya and the Tiny Desk trio explores the rhythms of the melody, up to and including the sing-along at the end.

Every exposure to Cuban music presents an opportunity to walk alongside historical music figures and Santeria spirits alike. This performance is no exception. Watching these three performances repeatedly reveals new musical turns that slowly reveal how Alfredo Rodríguez is making a name for himself, alongside two incredibly talented, like-minded band mates.

EkPrXL-H5Qc,Florence + the Machine: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Oct. 16, 2018 | Josh Rogosin -- Her nervousness was palpable and stood in stark contrast to her fully produced stage show. ""I'm sorry I'm shy,"" Florence Welch told the crowd of NPR family and friends gathered for her Tiny Desk performance. ""If this was a big gig, I'd probably be climbing all over here and running around.""

Opening with the song ""June,"" from Florence + the Machine's 2018 album High As Hope, Florence performed with her eyes closed. By the end of the three-song set, she fully embraced the experience and gave in to the rapturous audience. Within seconds of hearing her first note, the raw power of her un-amplified voice was chilling.

It's impossible to talk about Florence without her backing band. Tom Monger adds exquisite ethereal textures to the songs with his stunning mastery of the pedal harp. Hazel Mill's backing vocals and anthemic power chords on the keys accentuate the poignancy of the lyrics at just the right moments. And Robert Ackroyd's rhythmic, steady acoustic guitar drives the music forward.

But the intensity of the musicality is almost secondary to the message in her lyrics. Ear-worm melodies coupled with repetitive phrases create universal, awe-inspiring anthems. At the end of her first song, Florence implored the crowd to hold on to each other. In ""Patricia,"" she insisted it's such a wonderful thing to love. After 14 enchanting minutes, it's impossible to disagree.

O70s9aV_9_Q,Café Tacvba: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Oct. 12, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- It's appropriate that the pioneering Mexican band Café Tacvba (Tacuba) start its set with ""Olita del Altamar"" (""Waves from the High Seas"") from the group's 2012 album El Objeto Antes Llamado Disco. It's essentially an incantation of the magic that transpired during their performance behind Bob Boilen's desk. The lyrics sing of the comings and goings of waves, symbolic of the passage of time and fueled by the Mexican folk rhythm son jarocho, a favorite of the band's since their start almost 30 years ago.

They then fast forward to ""Diente de León"" (""Dandelion""), from their 2017 album Jei Beibi. It's a majestic, stripped-down version that puts the emphasis back on the lyric, a plea for existential and environmental harmony using the metaphor of the weedy flower. 

As usual, lead vocalist Rubén Albarrán is a captivating central presence, evoking a sense of down-home camaraderie with his ever friendly smile that has become the band's most outward image. Having seen the band play in front of dedicated fans in massive stadiums in Mexico City, it's striking to see his movements limited to a few careful spins and dance steps while still managing to embody the intense energy of their music.

Their song ""Las Flores,"" from their 1994 album Re, slips into the ska groove that attracted fans to rock en Español in general and to Los Tacvbas in particular, a beat that captures the adventurous musical energy that swept all of Latin America in the early 1990s.

Not all bands would end their set with a power ballad, though very few bands hold their audience's attention and dedication like Café Tacvba. But that's just how they close their set, the four principal members together for almost 30 years, casting a musical spell that still captivates after all this time.

BdmgKq4Mw48,Big Boi: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Oct. 10, 2018 | Abby O'Neill -- The energy in the room was buoyant and vibrant from the moment they walked in the door. OutKast star Big Boi, Sleepy Brown of the prolific Atlanta production collective Organized Noize, and their eight-member backing band have been working together for 20-plus years, and their chemistry is instantaneous and undeniable.

These guys helped redefine the sound and style of hip-hop in the '90s, incorporating funk and psychedelia while transcending genre boundaries. As half of OutKast — still the only rap group ever to take home Album of the Year at the Grammys — Big Boi continues to thrive as a solo act, riding the charts with last year's Boomiverse and its hit single ""All Night.""

Big Boi played that infectious, horn-drenched banger at the Tiny Desk, and book-ended it with two of his best-known OutKast songs: ""So Fresh, So Clean"" from 2000's Stankonia and ""The Way You Move"" from 2003's Speakerboxxx/The Love Below. Along the way, he and his stellar supporting players just keep feeding off each other in a set that's bound to leave you smiling.

6m0lk3M3_Ts,Cory Henry & The Funk Apostles: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Oct. 5, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- There's so much joy in the sound of the Hammond organ, especially for those of us of a certain age. Hearing it can transport you to the early '70s, when every rock band seemed to have one in its arsenal: The Allman Brothers, Santana, Deep Purple. In the hands of true masters — like the late Billy Preston and the very-much-alive Booker T. Jones — the organ can be a melodic, funky rhythm machine.

Cory Henry's name belongs in the same breath as the Hammond organ masters of the past. The instrument creates the central sound of his dynamic, neo-soul- and funk-infused musical identity, and he opens his turn behind the Tiny Desk with what feels like an encore: the full-on soul assault of ""Love Will Find a Way."" The song twists and turns, then winds up as a full-on celebration — and it's only the first song in his set.

Henry's keyboard skills are on full display during a synth solo in ""Trade It All,"" which also spotlights his entire band. To my mind, they'd have sounded right at home on Stax Records in the '70s — no small accomplishment. ""Send Me a Sign"" then showcases some of the roots of Henry's songwriting; it's inspired by church sermons that bloom into group sing-alongs. Just another way Cory Henry digs way back to give us something new and exciting.

LTzmjU8aOR4,Saba: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Oct. 1, 2018 | Rodney Carmichael -- Every Tiny Desk is special, but sometimes the stars align and we're treated to an artist just as he's coming into his own. Six months after releasing Care For Me — a sophomore studio LP on which Saba transforms his survivor's guilt into something equal parts traumatic and transcendent — the Chicago native paid a visit to Tiny Desk. His performance at NPR's Washington, D.C. headquarters came just two days after he announced his first tour of Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Korea, scheduled to begin in November. It's an incredible achievement for an independent artist who released one of 2018's best hip-hop albums without the benefit, or creative constraints, that come with major-label backing.

To help translate Care For Me live, Saba brought along a band consisting of the same musicians who helped bring his album to life in the studio — including Daoud Anthony and daedaePivot, who produced the entire LP with him; instrumentalists Cheflee and Brandon Farmer; theMIND and Kaina, who contributed vocals on the record; and another featured vocalist and special guest that Saba took extra pride in introducing.

""You're not gonna believe me when I say it,"" he prepped the crowd, turning to the tall man wearing the Saba tee and Panama hat. ""This is Chandlar, my father."" Fans of the album may be familiar with Saba's references to his dad on the songs ""Life"" and ""Prom / King"" — the epic seven-and-a-half minute eulogy to Saba's cousin and Pivot Gang rap collective founding member, John Walt, whose 2017 murder serves as the impetus for Care For Me. But Chandlar is also an accomplished soul singer, songwriter and producer in his own right, as well as one of Saba's earliest musical influences.

In a live set that proved to be as resonant as Care, Saba and his band showcased the album's emotional depth and range with stark juxtaposition, like the sound of the bright hook on album closer, ""Heaven All Around Me,"" set against a particularly haunting version of ""Life."" It's a Tiny Desk testament from an artist whose future feels as promising as his pen.

NkmGue2WQyg,Cécile McLorin Salvant: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Sept. 25, 2018 | Suraya Mohamed -- Standing behind the Tiny Desk with only pianist Sullivan Fortner by her side, jazz singer Cécile McLorin Salvant remarked that she hadn't been this nervous in a while. But it was hard to tell: She embraced the discomfort with ease, taking command of the space with a calm demeanor and spiritual presence that felt both humble and persuasive.

From listening to McLorin Salvant's exquisite performance here, I also couldn't tell that when she was 15, she was listening to Alice in Chains, sported a Mohawk and was into what she calls ""radical feminist punk stuff,"" as she told NPR after the performance. ""Sometimes I still really like Bikini Kill, and I still have my little Pearl Jam grunge moments.""

What can be heard in each song is a seasoned jazz singer with a vast vocal range, meticulous technical execution and a superb classical vocal foundation, which actually began when she was just 8. Her background in classical piano is evident in the inventive harmonic and melodic construction of the first three songs heard here; all are romantically themed McLorin Salvant compositions from her third album, For One to Love, recorded in 2015. The record won her a 2016 Grammy for Best Jazz Vocal Album.

McLorin Salvant closes with ""Omie Wise,"" an American folk song that tells the tragic story of murder victim Naomi Wise and her husband and killer, John Lewis:

Then pushed her in deep waters where he knew that she would drown

He jumped on his pony and away he did ride

The screams of little Omie went down by his side.

Feminist themes are common in McLorin Salvant's music, and while ""Omie Wise"" addresses gender-based violence, she says she sings difficult songs like this to address an important historical legacy. ""We don't sing to our kids and we don't know any of our folk music anymore,"" McLorin Salvant says. ""But like all of the history of race songs, coon songs, minstrel music, music from Vaudeville, all of that is like, 'No, we're not going to address that — that's too ugly.'""

While the words in ""Omie Wise"" hit hard, the ballad's melody — like all of the other music played here — is nothing but beautiful. McLorin Salvant's fifth album, a duo record with Fortner, comes out Sept. 28.

ZLqXimltxsg,Anthony Roth Costanzo: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Sept. 21, 2018 | Tom Huizenga -- Anthony Roth Costanzo is a feisty performer who knows a thing or two about busting down barriers in classical music. After all, opera singers don't normally belt out arias behind office desks, and they don't insist on lugging harpsichords with them. They also don't routinely sing in Bronx middle school classrooms and get students talking about emotions. But Costanzo is fearless. (And after seeing this amazing Tiny Desk performance, watch him melt the hearts of distracted sixth-graders.)

A word about Costanzo's voice. He is a countertenor, a man who sings in the range of a female alto. The roots of the tradition date way back to the 1500s, when young male singers, called ""castrati,"" were castrated in order to preserve their high, flexible voices.

""I've managed to do it without castration,"" Costanzo joked to the audience of NPR staffers. These days, countertenors sing in falsetto, and while as recently as 30 years ago it was considered something of an androgynous novelty, now countertenors are part and parcel of the opera world. (We've even hosted a countertenor before at the Tiny Desk.)

Costanzo performs songs from his new album, which pairs music by George Frideric Handel with Philip Glass. Strange bedfellows perhaps, and born more than 250 years apart, but somehow Glass' repetitive, staccato beats and Handel's long, flowing melodies manage to shake hands across the centuries.

One obvious common thread is the arrangements, by Nicholas DeMaison, that Costanzo commissioned expressly for this performance, featuring harpsichordist Bryan Wagorn (playing a beautiful double-manual French-styled instrument built by Thomas and Barbara Wolf), along with flutist Alice Teyssier and bassoonist Rebekah Heller.

Glass' ""Liquid Days,"" begins with a recitative introduction, similar to a Handel aria. But the lyrics, by David Byrne, depict love, in all its quotidian splendor, as a character who ""could use a shave"" and ""watches TV."" ""Pena tiranna,"" from Handel's undervalued Amadigi di Gaula, is a compelling example of how well the composer can spin a gorgeous melody to evoke the deepest anguish, while Glass' ""In the Arc of Your Mallet,"" with a text by the 13th-century Persian poet Rumi, speaks of longing in sexy undertones.

Costanzo's agile voice, with its polished tone and patrician phrasing, is a singular reminder that we live in a golden age of countertenors – guys who sing high in music both ancient and modern.

""Handel: Pena tiranna (From 'Amadigi di Gaula')""

9dc9kbRlwB8,Julie Byrne: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Sept. 19, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- Even in an office in broad daylight, Julie Byrne sings with both a husk and a whisper as if she's gone a long time without speaking - as if she's been alone, as if she's been traveling. Her opening number at the Tiny Desk, ""Sleepwalker,"" sings of the road as a source of freedom.

I lived my life alone before you
And with those that I'd never succeeded to love
And I grew so accustomed to that kind of solitude
I fought you, I did not know how to give it up

Julie Byrne's hypnotic fingerstyle picking conjures a sense of wandering, a style she adapted from her father and a sound she grew up with until multiple sclerosis robbed him of that companionship and comfort. She now plays her dad's guitar.

For me, the mark of a great artist is transformation - the ability to take me far from my everyday thoughts - to turn the ordinary into the extraordinary, or at least to see it in a different way. After performing ""Sleepwalker"" alone, Julie Byrne was joined by her musical companions, Marilu Donovan on harp and Eric Littmann on electronics. Together they conjure an ethereal compliment to Julie's love of the open landscape – I'm transported.

m_bOjWb0KeI,Smif-N-Wessun: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Sept. 17, 2018 | Abby O'Neill -- Brooklyn-bred hip-hop duo Smif-N-Wessun – consisting of partners in rhyme, Steele and Tek – illuminated the Tiny Desk with their signature, 80-proof poetry: straight, no chaser. Their music, inspired by their gritty and pre-gentrified Bedford-Stuyvesant and Brownsville neighborhoods, offers the vocabulary of veterans who survived the grimy streets. These original members of the Duck Down Records group Boot Camp Click represent quintessential '90s true-school hip-hop from the bedrock, when Timberland boots were standard issue. Backing Steele and Tek for the first time is D.C.'s own Black Alley band.

Smif-N-Wessun set things off with their classic debut single ""Bucktown,"" an ode to their native Brooklyn, which uses their love for lyrical clapbacks as an allegory for overcoming the violence-ridden reality of their wonder years. Their undeniable Gemini chemistry - clearly the byproduct of a 20-plus year friendship - is on full display. Throughout the performance, the two emcees dance, share easy banter and express their spiritual connection to the music they've created over the years.

Things climax when the two perform ""Stand Strong,"" another favorite from their debut album Dah Shinin'. Anchored by the mantra, ""I never ran / never will,"" the tune receives a refreshing update, courtesy of Black Alley. Driven by the live interpolation of their Beatminerz-produced tracks, the music decries the struggles of late-stage capitalism and the plight of the disenfranchised. It's a revelation of love, life, and brotherhood in an era when the antiheroes were really just the ones cunning enough to avoid becoming victims. That survivor's drive is personified when Steele lets his guard down during the performance and gifts the audience a little boogie, while referring to the ""holy ghost"" that has come over him.

The set concludes with an exclusive premier of their new single, ""One Time,"" from their forthcoming album, The All, produced by 9th Wonder & The Soul Council.

47XlUL6sRow,GoGo Penguin: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Sept. 14, 2018 | Colin Marshall -- During his setup, GoGo Penguin's pianist Chris Illingworth asked if he could remove our piano cover to ""access the inside"" and, after a few rotations of a screwdriver, he soon handed me a long plank of black painted maple, which has no convenient place to rest in the NPR Music office. If you look closely at the piano innards during ""Bardo,"" you can see a strip of black tape stretched over a few strings, opposite Illingworth's bobbing head. It mutes a group of strings, turning them into percussive jabs and dividing the instrument into more explicit rhythmic and melodic sections. What you can't see: GoGo Penguin's audio engineer a few feet to the left of frame, dialing-in reverb effects on the piano, which we heard in the room. These two elements, in tandem with bassist Nick Blacka's precise canvasing and drummer Rob Turner's charged and delicate pulse, have heavily contributed to the sonic identity of this trio - a signal to jazz jukebox listeners that, ""Ah yes, that's a GoGo Penguin tune.""

GoGo Penguin models closely the leaderless jazz power trio set in motion by forbearers in The Bad Plus, but you can also hear the drippings of electronica groups like Bonobo, and drum-and-bass foundations akin to Roni Size with a bit more acoustic rattle (Turner even fashions his own prepared drum accessories from rope, duct tape, and metal rings, which you can see resting atop his ride cymbal and snare. He tells me he usually has more, but he hasn't made new ones in a while).

But dissecting this music belabors what's certain: this trio has become a reference point of their own for new school instrumentalists, a coveted achievement for any jazz group, though their appeal stretches far outside the jazz ecosystem. In fact, in 2018 alone, the band played some of the world's most notable pop festivals like Bonnaroo and Outside Lands and top-tier international jazz festivals: Montreal and North Sea. This trio found a way to wedge themselves in the middle of the Venn diagram that overlaps musicians and music heads. Among my colleagues at NPR, I witnessed expressions ranging from studious squints to closed-eye meditation, those in the room experiencing GoGo Penguin's tunes like they would a collage: the fine details as valuable as the larger shape.

A8a2EosJIbM,Hobo Johnson and The Lovemakers: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Sept. 12, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- Hobo Johnson and the Lovemakers accomplished something remarkable this year with their Tiny Desk Contest entry. They made a simple backyard video - a single camera shoot - that's now been seen almost 10 million times on YouTube. And the song they played, ""Peach Scone,"" has unlocked a door to a dream - to play a Tiny Desk Concert and be heard. The song is a tale of one-sided love - a tale of kindness in the face of loneliness and depression. Now, ""a couple of kids - five I guess"" as its lyrics go, get to bring their creative, urgent and somewhat nervous energy from Sacramento, Calif. to play ""Peach Scone"" and more to millions of other listeners.

This is a band always on the verge of emotional explosions, all while Frank Lopes, aka Hobo Johnson, is quoting Shakespeare and making references to Jay-Z, The Front Bottoms song ""Twin Size Mattress"" and so much more.

The directness in their music, with its chorus shouts (""Damn I love those sandwiches!"") and the little asides (""I got a duvet the other day - how do you wash a blanket? In a washer? That's what I found out"") make for a remarkably personal performance. At times it's as much a storytelling session or personal confession than a musical performance, and for me it conjures feelings of empathy and understanding and compassion.

-RnRAtMwOEY,Jupiter & Okwess: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Sept. 7, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- Stop. Watch. Listen! You might be unfamiliar with Congolese rhythms, likely won't understand the language and won't know the vibe of Kinshasa street musicians, but trust me... Jupiter & Okwess are astonishing. Their fierce energy here at the Tiny Desk translates through familiar instruments of drums, bass and guitars in an astonishing performance.

Jupiter Bokondji comes from the troubled capital of Democratic Republic of the Congo. Jupiter and his band Okwess play music that feels both African and American, with Jupiter's early musical tastes inspired by The Jackson 5, James Brown and Kool and the Gang, plus the sounds of Motown. It's music he heard while shuttling back and forth with his family between Tanzania , Dar es Salaam and East Berlin. His father was an attaché at the Congolese embassy there.

Then of course there's Congolese rumba, the popular dance music from as early as the 1940s, not too dissimilar from some Cuban music of the day. And the message of the music has been steeped in the complicated politics of the region, stumbling between chaos, anarchy and oppression.

This is urgent music. Much of it can be heard on their vibrant album Kin Sonic, released in June of this year. It's music that stems from the gut but has thought and theatrics to flesh out the feelings. It's music to be experienced. This is your entry point.

l5OBuqmErPI,Kalbells: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Sept. 5, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- About a year ago, Ten Flowers, the debut album from Kalbells, came out and brought me a great deal of joy. At the Tiny Desk, the solo project morphed into a full-fledged band, where they debuted the tune ""Droolerz."" That song opens with camaraderie - ""I want a house / where everybody comes"" – and continues with a line that epitomizes the carefree humor of singer Kalmia Traver: ""We could play drums and eat lobster at the opera."" The band makes life-affirming music that Kalmia created over the past few years, filled with the triumph of being cancer free. The joie de vivre is palpable.

This isn't the first time Kalmia has performed a Tiny Desk concert. Her other band, Rubblebucket, brought their circus of contagious fun here more than three years ago. But for Kalbells and for Kalmia, Ten Flowers was about healing through expression, exploring uncharted musical landscapes and finding her voice outside of her tight partnership with Rubblebucket's Alex Toth. She used a tiny little synthesizer called the Critter & Guitari Pocket Piano to create random patterns that she improvised lyrics over before tearing it apart and pulling it back together, tightening the melody and lyrics. She then was joined by drummer Ian Chang, and though not in the band that came to NPR, he certainly helped shaped the rhythms of these songs. Her own saxophone playing at the Tiny Desk demonstrates the width of her musical palette adding harshness and deep character to these somewhat airy songs, and her talented minimalist band let her shine.

0b6gSb8ZKX4,George Li: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Aug. 31, 2018 | Tom Huizenga -- When George Li, the 23-year-old American pianist, revealed his Tiny Desk setlist, one thought came to mind: How will these powerhouse showstoppers sound on an upright piano? The music he intended to play, by Franz Liszt and Vladimir Horowitz, was designed for a real, 7-foot concert grand piano – the kind they used to call ""a symphony orchestra in a box.""

Turns out, there was nothing to worry about. Li's technique is so comprehensive, so agile, so solid, that instead of making our trusty Yamaha U1 quake in fear, he made the instrument sound several sizes larger, producing glorious, full-bodied colors and textures.

Li comes by his achievements honestly. He began lessons at age 4, and at 10 gave his first public concert. Five years later, he snagged the silver medal at the prestigious Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow. Last fall, he released his debut album on a major label and these days he's playing with many of the world's major orchestras while touring the globe. He just graduated from Harvard where he studied English literature and piano, in a hybrid program with the New England Conservatory.

Li is still young, but in some ways he's an old soul. Forget streaming services; he still listens to CDs. And his ""idol"" is the old-school, swashbuckling virtuoso Vladimir Horowitz, a pianist who died nearly 30 years ago.

To honor Horowitz, Li begins his Tiny Desk recital with the master pianist's electrifying reboot of a theme from Bizet's opera Carmen. Li describes it as an ""insane knuckle-buster."" Just watch his hands blur during the fiendish interlocking octaves at the explosive climax. Then it's two pieces by the ultimate monster pianist, Franz Liszt. The Consolation No. 3, with its gently flowing, long-lined melody and diaphanous ornaments, reveals the poetic side of the composer, while the rip-roaring La campanella begins with a single tinkling bell that multiplies into a wild cacophony of trills and scales, ending in what Li calls ""a big bang.""

George Li is a pianist whose star is very busy rising. And judging from the panache and precision in which he dispatched this extremely difficult music, he's an artist worth keeping an ear on for a good long time.

Set List
Horowitz: Variations on a Theme from Bizet's Opera Carmen
Liszt: Consolation No. 3
Liszt: La Campanella

Y-9ZQCS3Pb0,Tech N9ne Feat. Krizz Kaliko: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Aug. 29, 2018 | Rodney Carmichael -- During a career nearly three decades in the making, Tech N9ne has dodged the fickle rap industry while surfing his own wave, stylistically and professionally. The Kansas City native has been a beast for years now, a musical misfit who laid a track record of underground success and struggle before building his own independent empire with Strange Music.

""This is how we laugh at all the other rappers,"" Strange Music comrade Krizz Kaliko says, letting out a belly laugh near the end of duo's Tiny Desk set. Kaliko is another K.C. native and kindred spirit of Tech N9ne's. Together, they've carved out an unorthodox niche: chopper-style speed rap that often plumbs dark, emotional depths.

Their playful banter between songs personifies that creative connection, as Krizz delivers backing vocals and guest verses from the soul. Backed by a guitar, drums and bass for their Tiny Desk, the trio brought out the rock-tinged hues of such definitive Tech N9ne songs as ""Dysfunctional,"" ""Aw Yeah? (interVENTion)"" – dedicated to his mother who died from lupus in 2014 – and ""Fragile,"" originally assisted by Kendrick Lamar, Mayday and Kendall Morgan.

To close the set, Tech and Krizz performed ""Speedom (Worldwide Choppers 2),"" a song inspired by folk rocker Richie Havens' original classic ""Freedom."" After years traveling his own path, it's a fitting way to define Tech N9ne's wildly independent approach.

0Oob3oFJ0Ec,T.I.: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Aug. 27, 2018 | Rodney Carmichael -- Tip ""T.I."" Harris has lived the last 15 years of his life on the big stage. Fans have watched him rise, fall and ascend to new heights again, remaking himself each step of the way. From dope boy to dope emcee. From inmate to activist. From reality star and box-office draw to real estate developer and film producer.

But the Tiny Desk has a way of stripping even the biggest acts back down to their musical essence. For Tip, that meant stretching beyond his comfort zone again, this time by rapping along to a group of high school string players instead of his classic tracks. Without his usual audio prompts, he kept lyric sheets close at hand while running through the definitive street hits ""Rubber Band Man,"" ""What You Know"" and the Billboard 100 chart topper featuring Rihanna, ""Live Your Life."" He may have stumbled a few times, but when you've successfully reinvented your career as often as Tip has had to it's probably hard to stick to the same old script.

As for Tip's Tiny Desk transformation, he brought along his mini orchestra of young talent from Atlanta to fill in for Rihanna. The artists in training, from the non-profit Atlanta Music Project, put a classical twist on his street anthems, adding strings and brass in place of 808 bass. ""That's a true example that really says that you're never defined by your environment unless you want to be,"" Tip said, crediting the youngsters for their commitment to craft. Meanwhile, he kept his set funky with off-the-cuff stories of the drama behind his music — like the time when he found out, after shooting the video for ""Rubber Band Man"" with Puff Daddy, that his home had been raided by police. ""This music was about the elements that people have to endure in their lives every day and find a brighter side and make a way out of no way,"" he said. ""That's what this music represents.""

This year marks the 15th anniversary of Trap Muzik, the sophomore album that branded T.I. King of the South and birthed an Atlanta movement that would eventually give hip-hop a global makeover. The music gave voice to a discarded generation stuck between socioeconomic despair and criminal exploits. In a genre where the performance of authenticity snares talented artists in their own trap, Tip has conquered those demons. His last album, Us Or Else found him raising a conscious fist in unity against the systemic inequality highlighted by the Movement for Black Lives. Now, with more movie credits to his name than solo albums, his most respected role has been serving as part of Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms' transition team. But Tip's past is still present. In addition to investing in the redevelopment of Bankhead — the west Atlanta community that raised him and gave him game — he plans to return to his metaphoric roots on his next studio album, The Dime Trap.

Indeed, Tip still knows all about that.

JYGmDy7o2H0,Dermot Kennedy: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Aug. 24, 2018 | Stephen Thompson -- Dermot Kennedy took this assignment seriously. The Dublin singer-songwriter wasn't content with merely re-creating his songs as they sound in the studio, or stripping lavish productions down to simple acoustic arrangements. So he got himself a gospel choir.

More specifically, Kennedy and his band flew in from Ireland a day ahead of time to meet and rehearse with members of Washington, D.C.'s Howard Gospel Choir. Every arrangement was painstakingly plotted ahead of time, so that every note would be perfect.

Two of the songs Kennedy performs here (""Moments Passed"" and ""An Evening I Will Not Forget"") pop up on an EP he released this year with hip-hop producer Mike Dean, and both sound radically different in this performance. They're still forceful — and still centered on the singer's elastic, bombastic voice — but also looser, warmer, more open.

Put simply, they sound like the work of a future star: a modest former busker (and current NPR Slingshot artist) with a voice built to fill stadiums in more ways than one.

qZkGpj2w0XE,Camp Cope: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Aug. 23, 2018 | Marissa Lorusso -- After Camp Cope's second song at the Tiny Desk, singer Georgia ""Maq"" McDonald let out a tiny laugh. ""We've never done this before — we've never been quiet,"" she said. ""Not once in our entire lives!"" Bassist Kelly-Dawn Hellmrich joked that it was perhaps a ""good lesson"" to ""rock out in your mind."" (""Thinking,"" Maq clarified.)

The Australian trio makes music that's hard to tune out, both in terms of its typical punk-tinged rock volume and its general aversion to thoughtlessness. ""The Face of God"" — the track Maq, Hellmrich and drummer Sarah Thompson had just finished playing — is a stunning, delicate song about feeling lonely and distraught in the aftermath of sexual violence. It's a standout from the band's debut album, How to Socialise & Make Friends, and shows what Camp Cope does so well: using tiny moments of introspection to illuminate life's bewildering, terrifying, isolating aspects — especially as they apply to women. You can hear equal parts conviction and desperation in Maq's voice as she sings, ""I saw it, the face of god / And he turned himself away from me and said I did something wrong / That somehow what happened to me was my fault.""

The band closed its set with ""Keep Growing,"" an older track about autonomy and heartache led by Hellmrich's agile playing. Elsewhere, it might be too easy to tune into Camp Cope's powerful message and overlook the strength of the band's songcraft. But at the Tiny Desk, you can't miss it: Maq's gargantuan voice; Hellmrich's clever, melodic basslines; Thompson's stoic drumming.

Camp Cope's Tiny Desk performance opened — fittingly — with ""The Opener,"" a song about overcoming the obnoxious, exhausting and all-too-common sexism endemic to the music industry. It's a stunning and deeply gratifying performance; Maq lists off what exes, industry insiders and fellow musicians have said to undermine the band with a measured determination that sometimes tips into a full-throated, impassioned cry. Bands like Camp Cope get told they're ""just lucky,"" that they ""can't fill up a room,"" that they should ""book a smaller venue."" But when Maq roars from behind the Tiny Desk, ""See how far we've come not listening to you,"" she makes it clear which voice deserves the attention.

Set List
""The Opener""
""The Face of God""
""Keep Growing""

Musicians
Georgia ""Maq"" McDonald (vocals, guitar), Kelly-Dawn ""Kelso"" Hellmrich (bass), Sarah ""Thomo"" Thompson (drums)

3uiUHvET_jg,Yo-Yo Ma: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Aug. 17, 2018 | Tom Huizenga -- Why did Laurence Olivier return so often to Shakespeare's Othello? Why did Ansel Adams keep photographing the Grand Canyon? Obsessed or awestruck, artists revisit great inspirations because they believe there is yet another story to tell – about life, about themselves.

Cellist Yo-Yo Ma brought his great inspiration, and in turn part of his own life story, to an enthusiastic audience packed around the Tiny Desk on a hot summer day. Ma is returning, yet again, to the Six Suites for Unaccompanied Cello by Johann Sebastian Bach, a Mount Everest for any cellist. He has just released his third studio recording of the complete set and is taking the music on a two-year, six-continent tour. Ma's first recording of the Suites, released in 1983, earned him his first Grammy.

Ma has played the music for 58 years and along the way it's become something of a practical guide to living, pulling him through hardships and celebrating times of joy. ""It's like forensic musicology,"" Ma told the Tiny Desk audience. ""Embedded in the way I play is actually, in many ways, everything I've experienced.""

The undulating ""Prelude"" from the Suite No. 1 was the very first music Ma ever played. He was four years old. The soulful ""Sarabande"" from the Sixth Suite has served dual purposes, Ma explained. ""I've played this piece both at friends' weddings, and unfortunately also at their memorial services."" And the exuberant ""Gigue,"" from the Third Suite, with its toe-tapping beat, reminds us that Bach was far from a stuffed wig. Such is this sturdy, versatile and benevolent music, offering a full range of the human condition.

And then there is Ma. Certainly one of the most brilliant cellists of modern times, he's also a thoughtful, curious humanitarian, with an endless thirst to understand, celebrate, and connect disparate cultures of the world.

He's also a true mensch. As soon as he arrived at our office to play, Ma unpacked his cello – a famed 1712 Stradivarius – and immediately handed it over, with his bow, and said, ""Here play something."" It didn't matter that I'd never held a cello. It was just another one of Yo-Yo Ma's warm and welcoming gestures, another way to open up music to anyone and everyone.

Set List
J.S. Bach: ""Prelude (from Suite No. 1 for Solo Cello)""
J.S. Bach: ""Sarabande (from Suite No. 6 for Solo Cello)""
J.S. Bach: ""Gigue (from Suite No. 3 for Solo Cello)""

4cfmEgpOOZk,Erykah Badu: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Aug. 15, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- Some folks around the NPR Music office said they felt an almost spiritual connection to Erykah Badu during her visit to the Tiny Desk. And that was before she and her band even played a single note. It came from the waft of earthly scents that followed in her wake, to the flowing dreads and clothes that hung on her like robes.

After her self-introduction, which included a rundown of her spiritual and creative aliases, Badu rolled into one of her earliest musical calling cards, ""Rimshot."" It's an ode to the sound the percussionist makes when a drumstick is struck against the metal edge of the snare drum. On this performance, as on her 1997 album Baduizm, it becomes a device to play with time — stretching it, stopping it, suspending it. Propelled by jazz chords on the piano and the steady pulse of the acoustic bass, the playful performance unfolded in the tradition of the best bebop.

But the panoramic song ""Green Eyes"" is the centerpiece of Badu's Tiny Desk performance. It's wide-ranging in scope and musical arrangement and brilliantly executed by the jazz and hip-hop musicians in her backing band. The story of heartbreak is striking enough, but her interpretation showcases her formidable vocal skills. By the time it was over, we were all just as emotionally and spiritually spent as she was from the experience.

Erykah Badu is an artist for the ages. To old-school jazz fans like myself, names like Nina Simone, Betty Carter and Shirley Horn come to mind as much as Billie Holiday because of Badu's singular approach to a lyric. They all cut their own creative path and left behind a legacy that you can identify with just one note. Erykah Badu is on that same path, and one day her name will be mentioned along with the other Elders who share her spirit of musical adventure.

""Rimshot""
""Green Eyes""

IDksWTzZQ2c,Tower of Power: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Aug. 13, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- When the 10 members of Tower of Power were in place behind Bob Boilen's desk, strategically positioned around the band's famous five-piece horn section, their first collective blast three beats into the sound check literally made the video crew jump. It was more a force of nature than a sound, and an impressive display of the ""five fingers operating as one hand"" concept of band cohesiveness.

From the group's beginning in Oakland in 1968, its soul disciples stood out from the peace-and-love scene in the San Francisco Bay. Their dedication to the horn-driven soul heard on recordings from the Stax and Atlantic record labels evolved to such a sophisticated level as to make the Tower of Power Horns an entity unto themselves. Eventually artists as diverse as Santana, the Grateful Dead and even Elton John enlisted them to give their music an authentic connection to the scene.

I have to confess that this show was mostly a labor of self-indulgent love, since I've been a fan since about 1972. So it was a joy to listen to the unmistakable sounds of my youth as the band delivered both ""What Is Hip"" and ""So Very Hard to Go"" with so much vitality, it sounded as if they were just written last week. During the performance of the title track from their new album, ""The Soul Side of Town,"" the playing, the passion and the precision remains unchanged after all the years.

1968 was one hell of a year musically, as we've seen from this year's many anniversary celebrations of albums, events and bands. Add Tower of Power to that shortlist of artists for whom that moment was an early rehearsal for what would become a five decade career. A band this big will inevitably have some members come and go, but it's important to note that the original songwriting nucleus of bari saxophonist Stephen ""Funky Doctor"" Kupa and bandleader/tenor saxophonist Emilio Castillo continue to write and perform, as does original drummer David Garibaldi.

I want to write that the band has become an institution. But that conjures images of stuffy old men looking down professorially on youthful funksters, occasionally showing them how it was done in a long-lost golden era. Instead, Tower of Power remains as vital and full of life-affirming funk and soul, if not more, as they were in 1968. The band's dedication, hard work and connection to us long-time fans prove that a good idea is timeless. If you need proof, just watch this video.

Congrats, fellas. It's been a very soulful 50 years.

S_noXwzjavs,DAWN: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Aug. 10, 2018 | Lars Gotrich -- DAWN has a breathless enthusiasm for shape-shifting pop music. Her discography is a bedazzled collage of heart-bursting rave and extraterrestrial dance-pop — but for her Tiny Desk, the L.A.-based singer and producer strips three songs to just the essentials, illuminating the impeccable songwriting behind the wild combination of sounds.

Dawn Richard — who went by D∆WN for a while, and now just prefers DAWN — opens this set with ""Waves,"" transforming the trap-laced anthem for ""underpaid, underappreciated, undervalued and undermined"" women into a classic girl group song, flanked by two harmonizing vocalists. ""If you feelin' stress up in yo chest / Cause they forgot that you the best / Wave ya money,"" they sing, complete with immediately GIF'able dance moves. It's positively electric.

""Waves"" is followed by two songs from Redemption (my personal favorite album of 2016). Both ""Vines (Interlude)"" and, here, a funky revitalization of ""Lazarus,"" speak to Richard's mission to expand our preconceptions about who gets to make what kind of music.

""I find it interesting when you're a brown or black girl and you try to do something beyond R&B and hip-hop, it's not always cool,"" Richard says before performing ""Lazarus."" ""They don't get it. They think you're trying too hard. They don't know where to place you. I wrote this record because sometimes you're misunderstood. You know exactly who you are, but everyone else can't quite figure you out. I wrote this record for that person.""

Mub2i2BoHpM,Haley Heynderickx: Tiny Desk Concert,"Aug. 3, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- It's fitting for Haley Heynderickx to be singing at the Tiny Desk. The Portland singer entered our Tiny Desk Contest three years in a row with strong, though often frail songs. And she'd be among the first to tell you how entering that Tiny Desk Contest changed her life.

Unlike her solo acoustic contest entries, which are quiet, mostly solemn affairs, Haley Heynderickx came to NPR's Tiny Desk with her band: Denzel Mendoza on trombone, Lily Breshears on Moog bass, and Phil Rogers on drums. They opened with the song that is most out of character for Haley, a song she wrote as part of a song challenge and she challenged the crowd here at NPR to a sing-a-long. We didn't do so well, it was early in the day — but this song about self-doubt and searching for life's meaning with its cathartic phrase ""I need to start a garden"" (which is also the title to her 2018 debut) is a potent reminder to take action when life gets bewildering.

The second song, ""No Face,"" is a reminder to love people as kindly as you can; otherwise you'll wind up like the character No Face from the Hayao Miyazaki film Spirited Away. In introducing the final song, ""Worth It,"" Haley Heynderickx told the Tiny Desk crowd that it was written in a basement with the belief that it would never leave that basement. With this performance now behind her and the chance for hundreds of thousands of people to hear these personal but universal songs, there will be many of us, myself included, thrilled that her songs are out in the open, ready to be heard.

Aug. 6, 2018 | Bobby Carter -- There was a shift in Mac Miller's boisterous demeanor as he started the third of his three-song Tiny Desk set. It's the first time he's performed tracks from his new album, Swimming, in front of an audience. On ""2009,"" he rubbed his chin with clinched eyes, looking like a young man who's beginning to crack the code. Backed by a piano loop and a string quartet, he reflected on his journey's peaks and valleys thus far.

I ain't asking why no more
I know I'll take it if it's mine
I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door

With nearly a decade under his belt at 26 years old, these words ring like an artist twice his age.

We were introduced to Mac Miller via 2011's XXL Freshman Class, which featured a special crop of MCs such as Kendrick Lamar, Meek Mill and YG, all of whom are now considered in the upper echelon of hip-hop. After his big splash, he's been able to find a groove and consistently release quality rap records, ultimately keeping his name in the conversation with the other young greats. His 2011 album, Blue Slide Park, reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200, the first independently distributed debut album to do so since 1995's Dogg Food by Tha Dogg Pound. These consecutive triumphs amassed plenty of fame, fortune and insurmountable obstacles, causing a stumble here and there. Throughout the years, however, Mac has brushed himself off and put it in the music.

For this performance, Mac Miller invited frequent collaborator Thundercat, who graced the Tiny Desk last year and will join Mac on tour this fall. Thundercat put on a dazzling shaker routine and played the deep centerpiece bass line on ""What's The Use?"" These Swimming iterations don't veer far away from the recorded versions, but here, his lyrics seem easier to interpret under live instrumentation.

4kPRyzb9Z44,Del McCoury Band: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Aug. 1, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- There is a moment, near the top of this Tiny Desk concert — when three voices gather 'round a single microphone to deliver the chorus of ""That Ol' Train"" — that is so pure and beautiful it made my eyes well up with tears when we filmed it. Not since bluegrass legend Ralph Stanley played the Tiny Desk in 2009 have I felt vocals resonate so deeply.

Del McCoury is another bluegrass legend, singing, playing guitar and writing songs for the past 60 years, including his days with the ""father of bluegrass,"" Mr. Bill Monroe. The Del McCoury Band itself is 50 years strong, and these days includes Del's sons Robbie on banjo and Ronnie on mandolin and vocals. All are astonishing players, here joined by the five-time award-winning fiddling of Jason Carter and this year's International Bluegrass Music Association bass player of the year Alan Bartram.

For their visit to the Tiny Desk, the group brought along some traveling songs. The first (of two) train tunes, ""That Ol' Train,"" comes from their new album Del McCoury Still Sings Bluegrass, while their closing gospel tale ""All Aboard"" is a staple from 2001's Del and the Boys. The other (a motorcycle song), ""1952 Vincent Black Lightning,"" was written by another master of his craft, British folk icon Richard Thompson, and has been a part of Del's repertoire for a while now. It shows not only the deep connection that bluegrass has to British folk music, but also Del McCoury's willingness to keep his sound fresh all these years on.

These are story songs; Del is, of course, quite the storyteller, taking his time between them to reminisce. At 79 years old, he's got a lot of them tell.

qV3QhRG3KwY,Flasher: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"July 31, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- Flasher are a rock trio where the crafted details of its songs aren't buried by a clear love of noise. But for its visit to the Tiny Desk, this young Washington trio set aside the distortion and worked up a semi-acoustic set of three songs — taken from its debut album, Constant Image, released on Domino in early June — with vocals made central; voices sometimes in unison, sometimes swapping leads, adding a shifting point of view to songs that, on record, give equal footing to a precise noise.

These three high school friends, Taylor Mulitz (guitar, vocals), Daniel Saperstein (bass, guitar) and Emma Baker (drums) have been bouncing around the D.C. punk scene of house shows and DIY venues for some time. Washington, D.C. can feel like a small town at times: I've been aware of Taylor's work for a while, through in the potent D.C. band Priests; Daniel I've known (a bit) since he was a child, mostly from Hanukkah parties with his family (his mom was the executive producer at All Things Considered when I was the show's director); Emma can be seen playing around town with another band, Big Hush.

In Flasher's work I hear the influence of one of my favorite bands, Wire, especially its more aggressively textured sounds from the late '70s. But Flasher is not a throwback band; there's vitality to its sound that doesn't come from the past, but from swift imaginations — which you can hear in the way they've rearranged these songs for an intimate setting — and the tender hearts portrayed in their words. Its visit to the Tiny Desk shows off those creative energies, made lovingly vulnerable.

NoPz80SCCg0,Lalah Hathaway: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"July 25, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- Lalah Hathaway comes from royalty: Her late father Donny Hathaway's voice was crucial for my generation, setting the bar for inspired, old-school soul singing. But living in that kind of shadow can also be a burden, robbing the offspring of an identity apart from that of the famous parent.

The younger Hathaway's appearance behind the Tiny Desk pulls back the curtain a bit for a close-up encounter with her powerfully expressive voice. The lower registers always draw me in, and in ""Change Ya Life,"" Hathaway's dusky contralto paints an exciting portrait of blissful cohabitation — but on her terms. ""I'm going to teach you how to treat me like I deserve,"" she sings, adding, ""I'll give you the world."" She draws on a tradition of romance and sensuality in the best soul music, but with a feminist twist that eschews old-school, male-centric lyrics and attitudes.

Lyrics alone do not convey that kind of spirit. It's in Hathaway's delivery — self-assured yet vulnerable. ""Boston,"" her ode to her second home (she's from Chicago), is a meditation on self-discovery and longing. The band — electric piano, bass, drums — perfectly straddles slow-jam R&B and a jazz-ballad sensibility.

So much of the most powerful music from the Civil Rights Era wasn't about literal accounting of injustices; many of those songs enshrouded morality plays in the guise of romantic longing. Hathaway introduces the set-closing title track of her new album Honestly as an explicit reflection ""of my country at this time."" If you heard it for the first time without the introduction, it comes across as a lover's lament. But Hathaway's soaring vocals infuse it with the passion of resistance to bring her set to a close on a hopeful, joyous note.

38AYaRYfLqQ,The King's Singers: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"July 23, 2018 | Tom Huizenga -- Fifty years ago, a group of six guys walked on a London stage to perform for the first time as The King's Singers. They were choral scholars and graduates from King's College, part of England's venerable Cambridge University.

The group quickly earned a reputation for its precise and warm close-harmony singing, which is as strong as ever today. There have been more than 150 King's Singers recordings, Grammy and Emmy awards, and countless concerts and television appearances. New singers, of course, have cycled through over five decades, but the six-man vocal setup has remained constant: two countertenors, one tenor, two baritones and a bass. Also unchanged is the group's penchant for singing just about every style of music.

So it is no surprise that the current iteration of The King's Singers — in the midst of their 50th-anniversary tour — brings a diverse set list to the Tiny Desk, including a Beatles tune and a bawdy madrigal from the 1500s.

Notice the glistening top end on Lennon and McCartney's ""I'll Follow the Sun,"" courtesy of countertenors Timothy Wayne-Wright and Patrick Dunachie. ""Shenandoah,"" the traditional American song, sports a velvety carpet of accompaniment for baritone Christopher Bruerton's lead. The blend of light and color shifts beautifully in Bob Chilcott's diaphanous arrangement.

""Horizons,"" with its cinematic hissing, humming and other special effects, tells a tragic story of the San people of Southern Africa, while the rhythmic and risqué ""Dessus le marché d'Arras"" channels a bustling 16th-century French marketplace.

The King's Singers remains a vocal juggernaut, playing 150 concerts in this anniversary year. With its power, finesse and silky blend, the group is like some close-harmony Ferrari that can purr and growl, leaving you amazed at the splendor of the human voice.

Set List

""I'll Follow the Sun"" (Lennon-McCartney, arr. Bill Ives)
""Shenandoah"" (arr. Bob Chilcott)
""Horizons"" (Peter Louis van Dijk)
""Dessus le marché d'Arras"" (Lassus)

Musicians
Patrick Dunachie, Timothy Wayne-Wright (countertenors); Julian Gregory (tenor); Christopher Bruerton, Christopher Gabbitas (baritones); Jonathan Howard (bass)

TpO_8tk6yNQ,Ólafur Arnalds: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"July 19, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- It's as if the pianos were haunted. Somewhere about midway through this Tiny Desk, as Icelandic composer Ólafur Arnalds performed on his electronic keyboard, two upright pianos were playing lilting melodies behind him, absent any performer at the keys. And yet these ""ghosts,"" along with Ólafur's band of strings and percussion, put together some of the most beautiful music I've heard at the Tiny Desk, made all the more mysterious through its presentation.

About ten minutes into the performance Ólafur looked behind him at the two pianos, looked to the NPR crowd and said, ""well I guess you're all wondering 'what and why,' to which there's no easy answer."" He hit the keys on his electronic keyboard and the two pianos behind responded with cascading, raindrop-like notes. ""What I can say,"" he continued, ""is that I've spent two years and all of my money on this — to make my pianos go bleep-bloop."" What Ólafur was referring to is software that he and his coder friend, Halldór Eldjárn developed. A computer, loaded with this musical software (which Ólafur calls the Stratus system), ""listens"" to Ólafur's keyboard performance and responds by creating patterns that are musically in tune with the chord or notes Ólafur performed.

So why do this? Basically, it's a way to break out of the box musicians often fall back on as performers — the familiar responses that years of playing can reinforce. With that is the hope that the computer will create a response that is unfamiliar and, in some cases through speed of performance and the sheer number of notes played, impossible for a human to have made. So, it breathes new life into the music for the listener and the performer.

It was a gently stunning and memorable Tiny Desk. More of these creations can be heard on Ólafur Arnalds' brilliant, fourth solo album re: member. The full album is out August 24 on Mercury KX.

1PYNStp9jY0,The Midnight Hour: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"July 18, 2018 | Sidney Madden -- Tiny Desk concerts usually take place in the afternoon.

It might come as a surprise for a 1990s-era hip-hop artist and composer to deliver a sultry set of jazz fusion — one that seems better suited for midnight hours in a smoky club than late afternoon in a newsroom office — but keep in mind, the Tiny Desk itself was a surprise at its inception.

After years of produced releases and jam sessions, A Tribe Called Quest's Ali Shaheed Muhammad and composer Adrian Younge formed The Midnight Hour in 2018 and released a 20-track album of the same name that bathes fans in an elixir of hip-hop, R&B and jazz.

For the new band's Tiny Desk, the talented pair of impresarios — Younge stationed behind the keys with an undone satin bow tie and vaguely opaque glasses, Muhammad with a blue pinstriped suit and deep violet Fender guitar — turned their concert into a family affair, leading a six-piece band with interchanging vocalists through a stirring four-song set.

The session started with ""Black Beacon,"" a cut cool enough to personify the stride of a 1920s speakeasy boss, then jumped to a bluesy, '70s style ballad ""There is No Greater Love."" Less than 10 minutes later, Younge aimed the mic at 16-year-old Angela Muñoz, whose syllables were aided by a wispy snare as she sang with wisdom beyond her years. The group ended with the hopeful and key-heavy ""Mission.""

Younge and Muhammad first teamed up in 2013 on a Souls of Mischief album, and later joined forces to soundtrack Marvel's Luke Cage series. Based on the success of the Netflix series and the genre-hopping magic conjured at this Tiny Desk, it's clear why this new outfit deserves its own moment in the limelight.

Set List

""Black Beacon""
""There is No Greater Love"" feat. Loren Oden and Saudia Mills
""Bitches Do Voodoo"" feat. Angela Muñoz

Musicians
Adrian Younge (keys), Ali Shaheed Muhammad (bass), Jack Waterson (guitar), David Henderson (drums), Stephanie Yu (violin), Bryan Hernandez-Luch (violin), DeAndre Shaifer (trumpet), Jordan Pettay (saxophone)

ivR988qCPik,Mumu Fresh Feat. Black Thought & DJ Dummy: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"July 11, 2018 | Abby O'Neill -- Mumu Fresh sings that the teacher arrives when the student is ready. During a recent trip to the Tiny Desk, she came bearing life lessons from the depths of her soul.

A regal combination of black power and Native American pride, Mumu Fresh — also known by her birth name Maimouna Youssef — is an abundantly gifted singer and emcee who prances between genres and styles. The Baltimore native fuses her rich multi-octave range and ferocious rap delivery with spiritually-inclined lyrics so potent and mindful they precipitated a wellspring of emotion throughout the room.

Mumu is not new to NPR Music. During her guest appearance at February's August Greene Tiny Desk, she stirred emotions with her verse on ""Practice,"" which spoke cathartically about the realities of being a black woman. Mumu began her own Tiny Desk in her native Lakota tongue with ""Ink Pata,"" signaling a call to prayer in a sacred ritual. Looped tribal chants of her own harmonies set the mood as delivered a stirring spoken word performance that journeyed through her ancestral lineage to the struggles of the present day.

With a buoyant and thoughtful spirit, Mumu and her band transitioned into the classic-sounding ""Miracles"" from Vintage Babies, her collaborative album with group mate DJ Dummy. Declaring it a celebration of soul music, she mixed sweet tender melodies with lyrics to empower those devoid of hope. It's in this song that Mumu shared the proverb about the teacher and the student, while reminding us that we all have to be ready for blessings yet to come. It made for a fluid segue into ""Work In Progress,"" accented by the feel-good chords of The Roots keyboardist Ray Angry, an ebullient backdrop to Mumu's humanizing and candid rap verse detailing her pathway to personal growth and self-love.

The set concludes with a new version of ""Say My Name,"" a song Mumu wrote about Sandra Bland, who died in police custody in 2015, and the impact it had on her. Starting off with a 1950s doo-wop circle, she blends traditional soul elements with politically relevant lyrics. Given Mumu's stint writing and touring with The Roots after high school, it was only fitting to have front man and lyrical force Black Thought make a special guest appearance.

Set List

""Ink Pata""
""Miracles/Work in Progress""
""Say My Name"" (feat. Black Thought)

Musicians

4Majbw74o1I,Rev. Sekou And The Seal Breakers: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"July 10, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- The horns burst, the voices wail and, as if about to launch into a sermon, this author, activist, intellectual, pastor and singer introduces himself: ""My name is Rev. Sekou and these are the Seal Breakers, now they from Brooklyn."" He points to his band and continues, ""but I was raised in in a little old place called Zent, Arkansas that's got about 11 houses and 35 people, and they'd work from can't-see morning to can't-see night and then they'd make their way to the juke joint. And then early Sunday morning they'd make their way to the church house."" As he stokes up the NPR crowd, mixing church preaching with juke-joint jiving, he adds, ""there's a lot of trouble in the land, but we've got one question for you: Do you want to get free? Say Yeah!""

And then Rev. Osagyefo Uhuru Sekou tosses off his large-brimmed, black hat, shakes his dreadlocks and demands freedom with these words: ""We want freedom and we want it now!""

""Resist,"" is just the opener to one of the most rousing Tiny Desk Concerts I've seen. During this 20-minute set Rev. Sekou took us all through an even wider range of emotions as he recalled the horrors of the white nationalist march in Charlottesville, Va. last summer. He said he spent weeks in preparation, organizing clergy for what he says was ""the largest gathering of white supremacists in modern history,"" then watching the activist ""Heather Heyer take her last breath"" after she was struck by a car that plowed into a crowd of marchers. The song ""Bury Me"" is a bluesy anthem to freedom that honors those who have died in that struggle for racial equality and freedom. In his free-form preamble to the touching ballad, Rev. Sekou works himself into a passionate frenzy, before airing his intense indignation for President Trump.

I saw Rev. Sekou perform in Austin during this year's South by Southwest music festival. I believe him when he tells the NPR crowd ""I'm Pentecostal, we can go on for two or three hours!"" His call to action is fervent and wholehearted, steeped in history with hopes for brighter days.

""Resist""
""Bury Me""
""The Devil Finds Work""

qMMO4xhe-xA,Frédéric Yonnet With Special Guest Dave Chappelle: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"July 9, 2018 | Abby O'Neill -- When Dave Chappelle jumped on to the mic to introduce harmonica player Frédéric Yonnet and The Band With No Name, it was clear this would be a special Tiny Desk. Chappelle and Yonnet's decade-long friendship started when Chappelle invited the French musician to play his Block Party tour in 2006. Yonnet later became the musical host of Dave Chappelle's Juke Joint, a series of intimate parties featuring Yonnet, The Band With No Name, and an all-star cast of unannounced musicians and actors.

Yonnet (pronounced YAH-nay) kicked off the Tiny Desk concert with a mélange of New Orleans jazz and funk. From the moment the NPR staff first heard his pocket-sized harmonica, you could feel the electricity in the room. There are virtually no limitations to this instrument in the hands of Yonnet, who is famous for his ability to play chromatic notes on a diatonic harmonica. It's one of the reasons he's toured with Stevie Wonder, Prince, Erykah Badu and Ed Sheeran. During Chappelle's introduction, he told the crowd about how Yonnet met Wonder at the Grammys and was asked to hop on the Songs In the Key of Life tour. ""He's so good at playing harmonica that another man good at harmonica hired him,"" Chappelle joked.

Yonnet and his Band With No Name were right in the pocket with original funky numbers ""Four20"" and ""FRéEDlosophy,"" both of which will appear on his upcoming album, Reed My Lips. Chappelle's desire to hear some of that ""Mississippi Delta blues"" prompted ""No Smokin' Blues,"" which gave guitarist Robbie McDonald, saxophonist Matthew Rippetoe, trumpet player Joe Herrera and keyboardist Daryl Hunt a chance to shine.

After his friend's Tiny Desk concert ended, Chappelle spent an hour touring the NPR newsroom, where he mimicked NPR's newscasters and teased them with genuine affection. It was a great respite from the daily news cycle.

Set List
""Four20""
""FRéEDlosophy""
""No Smokin' Blues""

SZxnLj2cSzY,PJ Morton: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"July 2, 2018 | Rodney Carmichael -- Staying true to his own musical vision has always come first for PJ Morton. So when he expressed his desire to squeeze a 10-piece string section behind the Tiny Desk for his three-song performance, we were more than happy to oblige him.

Morton showed off the soulful Fender Rhodes chops that helped him earn a mentor in Stevie Wonder and membership to Maroon 5, while backed by percussion, bass and the same Matt Jones Orchestra that accompanies him on his soulful solo releases, Gumbo and Gumbo Unplugged.

He began prepping what would become his noteworthy pot of musical stew after moving back home to New Orleans from L.A. a couple of years ago. The preacher's kid with the gospel roots wound up collecting two 2018 Grammy nominations for music from Gumbo, his fourth studio LP. Ironically, those industry accolades came as a direct result of Morton choosing to go his own way.

""So many people didn't want me to be myself,"" he told the Tiny Desk crowd during the intro to ""Claustrophobic,"" a song about the attempts major labels made to box him in. ""But I decided I was going to be PJ no matter what people told me and tried to get me to do.""

They tried some strange things, too. One record exec interested in signing him even suggested pairing Morton with popular West Coast hip-hop producer DJ Mustard. ""It was so far off base,"" he told NPR's Michel Martin last January. Instead, he started his independent music label, Morton Records, with the vision of creating a new Motown in his hometown.

New Orleans' musical lineage seasons the entire set of his Tiny Desk performance, including the second song, ""Go Thru Your Phone,"" on which Morton's joined by backing vocalists The Amours. All together, it made for a total of 15 musicians squeezed behind Bob Boilen's desk — not to mention Matt Jones, conducting off-camera. The industry may not have seen the vision, but from where we stood it was a perfect fit.

SET LIST
""Claustrophobic""
""Go Thru Your Phone""
""First Began""

yVoa4sxIqGs,Golden Dawn Arkestra: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"June 29, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- It was a late night at an unfamiliar club in Austin, Texas when the spirit, sound, lights and costumes of the Golden Dawn Arkestra put a huge, dreamy smile on my face. It took more than three years to get ten of the players and performers in this band (there are often even more) to my desk. I tried to transform the bright daylight of the NPR office with some of my handy, previously used holiday laser lights. But honestly, it wasn't until their psychedelic jazz kicked in that the office transformation felt real. Band leader, Topaz squawked through his megaphone to join them on their journey, while singing ""Children of the Sun.""

Topaz told me that the band's inspiration for both the name and the spirit of the musicians is loosely based on the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The organization, devoted to the study of the occult and paranormal activities, has been around since the 19th century.

Both of Topaz's parents were heavily into spiritual movements and what happens here falls somewhere between high art and a circus, with music that feels connected to Sun Ra's jazz, the extended musical adventures of The Doors and the surprise elements of Parliament-Funkadelic. You can dance and/or trance, or sit back and enjoy the spectacle.

iU0_cYjm8HE,Rakim: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"June 25, 2018 | Abby O'Neill -- It had been nearly a decade since Rakim released new music, but that drought ended Friday when the godfather of rap lyricism and one half of the revered duo Eric B & Rakim released a new song, ""King's Paradise."" The track was written for Season 2 of Marvel's Luke Cage, which premiered on Netflix the same day, but it wasn't entirely new to select NPR staff; they heard it days earlier when the God MC performed at the Tiny Desk.

The New York rap icon wasn't the only legend in the building that day. Ali Shaheed Muhammad of A Tribe Called Quest — who produced and co-wrote ""King's Paradise"" with keyboardist Adrian Younge under their new project The Midnight Hour — played bass, and rising blues torchbearer Christone ""Kingfish"" Ingram sat in on guitar.

""King's Paradise"" pays homage to the heroes of the Harlem Renaissance as well as its fictional superhero, the bulletproof Luke Cage. Rakim tipped his hat to Philip Payton Jr., Joe Lewis, Lena Horne, Malcolm X, Maya Angelou and Louis Armstrong, before concluding with a few bars about the comic book-inspired series.

Younge then led the nine-member backing band through two of Rakim's undeniable classics: ""Paid in Full"" and ""Know the Ledge."" For the former, drummer David Henderson rolled right in with the unmistakable breakbeat, — originally sampled from The Soul Searchers ""Ashley's Roachclip."" Muhammad, who's been playing bass since age 19 despite being known for his production and DJ work, provided the low end for ""Know The Ledge.""

Rakim released his first single 32 years ago, yet the timbre of his voice and Dali Llama aura remain strong. Let's hope this is the beginning of another renaissance.

ieoiAeL-uow,Dave Matthews: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Stephen Thompson | June 27, 2018 -- When you go to a Dave Matthews Band concert, you expect a super-sized performance, complete with expansive solos and a nice, long set list. So when Matthews shed his backing players to swing by the Tiny Desk for a solo gig, he couldn't just knock out three songs and bail. Instead, he played a set so long — so defiantly un-Tiny — that his between-song banter could have filled a Tiny Desk concert on its own.

After a bit of judicious trimming, we're still left with this warm, winning, utterly game, happily overstuffed performance, which balances songs from Dave Matthews Band's new album Come Tomorrow (""Samurai Cop,"" ""Here on Out"") with older material (1998's ""Don't Drink the Water,"" 2012's ""Mercy"") and a deeper cut from his 2003 solo album (""So Damn Lucky""). And, we had to leave in some of Matthews' banter, which includes a priceless bit in which he enthusiastically illustrates some of the many differences between playing on stage with a band and sitting at an office desk with an acoustic guitar.

Q5kvsLnHJDY,From The Top: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"June 22, 2018 | Tom Huizenga -- Whenever a symphony orchestra or opera house loses its financial footing, a chorus of classical music ""coroners"" quickly steps up to pronounce the imminent demise of an entire genre. The pianist and scholar Charles Rosen put it best when he said, ""The death of classical music is perhaps its oldest continuing tradition.""

As proof that classical music in America is alive and kicking, I'd like to direct those perennial naysayers to the radio show, and podcast, From the Top. The program (distributed by NPR) is a potent antidote to any gloom-and-doom doubter.

For over 20 years, From the Top has built an impressive platform to celebrate the music, lives and stories of youngsters playing classical music. That's right. Young people in this country love classical music.

We invited three talented From the Top musicians to the Tiny Desk. No squeaky violins here. These kids are terrific players.

Sparks fly (and bow hairs, too) when 12-year-old violinist Kaia Selden tears into Henryk Wieniawski's rip-snorting Scherzo-Tarentelle. Cellist Noah Lee uncovers fascinating new sounds on his instrument in Mark Summer's Julie-O, while Javier Morales-Martinez makes his velvety clarinet sing in elegant music by Francis Poulenc. From the Top alum Derek Wang is our good-natured emcee, in addition to serving as a sensitive accompanist.

These incredibly talented young musicians are our future. Hear them breathe life into music that is very far from fading away.

86LSRQUrCjw,The Messthetics: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"June 20, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- It was Take Our Daughters And Sons To Work Day when this somewhat loud and sometimes frenetic band came to play at my desk. I couldn't help but wonder if The Messthetics would inspire some eight-year old child in the office to one day become a musician, one who'd go on tell the tale of seeing these D.C. legends at an office when they were a kid.

For me it was exhilarating to see musicians I've known and loved for years be invigorated by younger talent. That's what happened when the bass and drums from D.C.'s pioneering punk band Fugazi crisscrossed with the brilliant, skillful and younger guitarist Anthony Pirog. It's only fitting that this Tiny Desk Concert happened on D.C. turf.

I've seen Anthony in a number of settings around town, including the brilliant duo he has with his wife, cellist Janel Leppin called Janel and Anthony. His playing can be understated and over-the-top all at the same time. It never feels self-indulgent and his music always serves the song. Drummer Brendan Canty saw the guitarist perform once and they eventually formed a band. Together, Brendan and bassist Joe Lally are a brilliant pulse of energy and that allows Anthony the freedom to fly. The music they create is like no other. The instrumental music they make is memorable, relatable and transcendent.

Y1Kv_sFZHqI,Yissy García & Bandancha: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"June 15, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- There is a sonic revolution happening in Cuba these days. A new generation of musicians are taking the training they received in Cuba's fabled classical music academies to new heights by incorporating not just jazz, but hip-hop, funk and any manner of experimental music. Yissy García and Bandancha may be the best example of that vanguard.

From the moment you hear the pre-recorded sound collage underneath the credits, it's a sign we're not in the Buena Vista Social Club. The compositions (all by García) are modern and reflect the cosmopolitan attitude that is common in big city life in Cuba. For example, ""Ultima Noticia"" is highlighted by the riffs thrown back and forth between drummer García and the turntablist, DJ Jigüe. The command of time and imagination García displays in her first drum solo of the set is simply astonishing.

The entire set is a lesson of contemporary Cuban music. The rapping on ""Universo"" reminded me of Cuba in the early 1990s when hip-hop entered the national consciousness as the Soviet Union left the island to fend for itself economically. On this track, it's a celebration of the universal goodness we all share.

The band winds up their time behind the desk by going back to Cuba's African roots for a rumba-soaked jam with sampled Afro-Cuban drums and rhythms. The complexity of the music meshes lockstep with passionate singing and dancing.

Yissy García and Bandancha are already Havana favorites, and I'm thrilled they're finally getting a chance to spread their music around the world. We are very fortunate that one of their stops was the Tiny Desk.

19dIwTQk0GU,Khalid: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"June 18, 2018 | Sidney Madden -- Before Khalid performed ""Location,"" his debut single that's now four-times platinum, at the Tiny Desk, he told the audience the story of how he wrote the track during his senior year of high school not knowing where music would take him. (FYI: He graduated in the Class of 2016. Feel old yet?) And before singing ""Saved,"" Khalid explained that this was one of the first songs he ever wrote and remembers that when he put it up on SoundCloud, a rude commenter tried to diminish his talent. Obviously, he didn't let the negative energy stop him.

""I honestly couldn't tell you what that guy is doing with his life but he's not doing this,"" Khalid said with a contagious laugh.

Khalid's music narrates life's awkwardly necessary moments: the butterflies of young love, the angst of craving freedom, the apprehension of teetering on that next step in life. He creates honest, comforting pop for teens and young adults that speaks to the kid in all of us. Accompanied only by acoustic guitarist Jef Villaluna, the 20-year-old sensation captured this fleeting fearlessness of youth and brought it to the Tiny Desk for a heartfelt serenade session. The way his voice glided calmly over the guitar notes, switching between baritone and tenor, was fitting given that he sings about teenage peaks and pitfalls. Khalid's sense of wide-eyed yet humble wonder permeates through the entire set.

Khalid finished his set with a mini bow and a peace sign to the audience, but made sure to squeeze in time for some of the diehard fans in the crowd of NPR employees and their guests — many of whom were gleeful teens, some just as awkward, angsty and wide-eyed as he when penning his first songs in high school. He understood.

B76B_akQJuM,GoldLink: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"June 13, 2018 |  Sidney Madden -- GoldLink is a man of the people. As a D.C. native, the skinny, stylish rapper acted as if his Tiny Desk performance was a family reunion and took the opportunity to invite everybody and their cousin in as his guests.

To mark the moment, Link wore a crisp T-shirt reading 'I Told You So' — a nod to the haters, no doubt — and jumped around his discography to perform cuts from each of his three projects: ""Bedtime Story"" from 2014's The God Complex, ""Dark Skin Women"" from 2015's And After That, We Didn't Talk and finally ""Some Girl"" and ""Pray Everyday (Survivor's Guilt)"" from 2017's At What Cost. But instead of the usual Steve Lacy or Kaytranada-aided beats, Link delivered his verses accompanied by a smooth six-piece band and two velvet-voiced singers. (Link's longtime producer Louie Lastic plays bass for the entire set.)

""Thank y'all for being here. It's mad overwhelming lowkey,"" Link admitted with a laugh at the audience that had flocked in his honor. As he loosened up, Link made time for bossa nova steps and shoulder shimmies, and by the end of the four-song set, he had the crowd swaying as well.

Last year was a significant one for the 25-year-old rapper once considered one of hip-hop's oddballs. His incorporation of electro-bounce beats into tongue-twisting rhymes earned Link a web following back in 2013, but it was just last year when he finally heard his voice on national radio thanks to the breakout track ""Crew."" The subdued stinger produced by Teddy Walton and featuring fellow D.C. area natives Brent Faiyaz and Shy Glizzy showcased Link's nonchalant cadence in a digestible fashion. While ""Crew"" enjoyed a slow burn — gradually accumulating streams and spins as a summer song in 2017 and earning the artist his first Grammy nomination earlier this year in the category of Best Rap Performance — it also positioned him as a new musical savior of his city. Link used this spotlight to draw attention to D.C.'s overlooked influence on popular music. On his album, At What Cost, Link traces the history of go-go, gun violence and gentrification in his hometown. As the poet recited before ""Pray Everyday (Survivor's Guilt),"" Link's goal through his music is ""for the DMV to reign for many moons.""

9C55DOhatXc,MILCK: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"June 8, 2018 | Robin Hilton -- We had wanted to get MILCK (aka Connie Lim) to the Tiny Desk ever since she captured the hearts of so many by performing her song ""Quiet"" during the Women's March On Washington last year. Before the concert, we talked a lot with her and her production team about how to best share her deeply affecting, anthemic pop songs. Should we have a choir? Maybe a string quartet? Or should she bring out all her gear and perform as a one-woman band, live looping everything with backing tracks, to recreate the album experience? In the end she chose the simplest (and perhaps most fitting arrangement for an artist often billed as a one-woman riot): just MILCK, by herself, with a keyboard.

Few artists can wreck me so quickly and completely as MILCK does with her songs about lonely outcasts, troubled souls and survivors who soldier on in a world that doesn't believe in them. In fact, she opened this Tiny Desk with her stirring ballad ""Black Sheep,"" a song she and I bonded over during an emotional interview earlier this year, when we discovered we were both the square pegs of our respective families. It's also a song I can barely even think about without tearing up.

Perhaps it's because the ultimate message in ""Black Sheep,"" like pretty much all of MILCK's music, is that you are not alone. It's a celebration of universal, unconditional love, something the whole world could stand to hear and get behind. These songs also resonate so profoundly because they come from a genuine and heartfelt place – from MILCK's own experiences and not a corporate office churning out scientifically proven pop formulas (though to be sure, she has a voice as thunderous and a range as wide as some of our biggest pop music stars).

MILCK followed ""Black Sheep"" with a sobering version of ""Quiet"" before closing with a brand-new song, ""Oh My My."" Calling it ""infuriatingly joyful,"" it documents the journey she's taken, and where she's landed, with one simple, beautiful refrain: ""What a life, what a life, what a life, what a life.""

""Quiet""

June 11, 2018 | Sidney Madden -- It's a good thing the weather was gloomy the day Jorja Smith rolled in for her Tiny Desk concert. Even though the skies threatened rain and thunder, the overcast light lingering in our dimmed office space allowed the teardrop pendant lights, hung from the ceiling by her lighting team, to cast the desk in a warm, honey-hued glow. And while the nimble guitar strings and double-time drums of her supporting band was enough to dizzy the focus in the room, it was the U.K. singer's slow, silky cadence that anchored the performance in tranquility.

As Smith worked her way up the scales to each high note in ""On My Mind"" (a track usually sung over a reverberated garage beat) and ""Teenage Fantasy"" (a ballad to love lost written when she was 16), there wasn't an ounce of pressure evident in her face or body language. When she closed her eyes to deliver the rap verse of ""Blue Lights,"" the anti-injustice song that first positioned her as a SoundCloud darling in 2016, a hush fell over the room in awe of her precision.

Though Smith's boldface collaborations to date range from Drake to Kali Uchis, her debut album Lost & Found is free of featured acts. Much like this Tiny Desk performance, those 12 tracks show off Smith's talent in a minimalist way — musing about life and love with the ambiguity and sense of agency that only comes with newfound freedom.

After she finished, but before retreating to the comfort of Supreme sweats, Smith and her band bestowed the Tiny Desk with a blue lava lamp signed by every member. Keep an eye out for that Easter egg in future episodes.

SBziTI8VfAQ,Grace VanderWaal: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"June 6, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- When 14-year-old Grace VanderWaal came to perform at the Tiny Desk I had to confess to her (and her mom) that, until my ""accidental concert experience,"" I had no idea who she was, nor did I know what America's Got Talent was.

It all started this past February, when I went to the 9:30 Club, a 1,200 capacity music venue, to see what I thought was a show by rock guitarist Grace Vonderkuhn and her power trio from Delaware.

When I arrived for the unusually early 7:30pm show, I saw a long line of young teens wrapping around the block, mostly girls, and a fair smattering of adults who didn't look like the regular concert goers who head to the 9:30 Club on a weekday evening. And as you've likely guessed by now, the show I was about to witness was not the riff-rock guitar player we'd recently featured on All Songs Considered but a very different sort of wunderkind who won the hearts of millions as the 11th winner of America's Got Talent and, now, a Columbia recording artist.

Inside the club was a massively enthralled and enthused crowd and it didn't take long for me, one of the few older guys in the club, to also be completely swept away by her performance. It was a dazzling show that felt fresh, sincere, bold but also simple, with Grace on ukulele singing songs such as ""Moonlight,"" a song about a friend dealing with mental health issues, which she also performs here at my desk.

""She always has a smile
From morning to the night
The perfect poster child
That was once in my life
A doll made out of glass
All her friends think that she's great
But I can see through it all
And she's about to break""

Despite what I feel is my broad love of music, I was reminded how easy it is to get comfortable in the musical confines we devise for ourselves. It's easy to stereotype artists and perhaps be dismissive of something that falls outside our comfort zone. But Grace's show and music reminds me to keep my thoughts and judgements open. So, if you're about to pass on watching this one, figuring you're not going to connect with a young teen and her music, stop. Take a deep breath, open up your heart and let Grace VanderWaal enchant you with her unique talent.

Grace VanderWaal's current album is called Just the Beginning.

PBKa-AAy_vo,Daniel Caesar: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"June 4, 2018 | Bobby Carter -- Daniel Caesar and his band had a clear vision for their Tiny Desk performance. While already confined to a small space, they opted to congregate at the piano, where producer and music director Matthew Burnett sat to create what feels like a fly-on-the-wall moment. We're presented a purity that's nearly impossible to capture on an album.

The success of Caesar's debut LP, Freudian, has created a groundswell of fanfare and exposure for the 23-year-old singer-songwriter. It was nominated for two Grammys and won two Junos (Canada's equivalent to the Grammys). We've seen him perform on Late Night with Seth Meyers, pop stars are serenading him with his own songs and his set at this year's Coachella festival was one of the most buzzed about (behind the queen Bey, of course). Caesar's is an organic ascent that's yet to reach its peak.

Caesar carries a coy aura about him, until he opens his mouth to sing. The years of training in church, fused with natural talent, is on full display. Supporting vocalists Camille Harrison, Danah Berry and Nevon Sinclair are in tow for the whole ride, providing some of the richest harmonies we've heard at the Tiny Desk. I found myself fixated on the playful manner in which the band members interacted with each other.

Caesar didn't hold back with the set list. He performed his three most-streamed songs (a combined 249,000,000 plays on Spotify alone), including ""Best Part,"" which included a Tiny Desk guest appearance by NPR Music favorite H.E.R.

IUMTaAQ43lY,Tom Misch: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"June 1, 2018 | Bobby Carter -- I learned a few things while watching Tom Misch perform at the Tiny Desk that should've been obvious to a longtime fan like me: He produces beats with a live audience in mind. As much as his drums slap, guitar is the foundation for most of his songs and he showcases a burgeoning talent on the instrument throughout his set.

I first caught wind of this UK wunderkind in 2014. Crafting his own instrumental projects and remixing tracks by artists ranging from Busta Rhymes to Lianne La Havas, Misch steadily garnered a dedicated following on SoundCloud. From there, he collaborated with other London artists and released EPs of original music on the platform. Misch's style doesn't revel in what's going on in pop music today; like a handful of other artists from the UK, his interpretation of hip-hop and R&B is a continuation of what the greats who came before him started. A healthy dose of that inspiration is drawn from the late J. Dilla, while Misch's up-tempo dance numbers align him with the Kaytranadas of the world. In 2016, Misch — still just 21 years old at the time — decided to dabble more in songwriting and explore that soothing timbre of his voice on Reverie, and all of a sudden, his potential rose exponentially.

Misch and the band arrived bright and early to get situated behind the Tiny Desk and rehearse. Misch has said before that he isn't a jazz purist intrinsically, but the way he opens up a guitar solo or jams with saxophonist Braxton Cook, jazz music certainly runs through him.

If you haven't heard of Tom Misch before this performance, now's a good time to catch up. Check out his breakthrough album, Geography, as well as his earlier collaborations, then come back and watch his Tiny Desk again for a true appreciation of his growth as an artist.

SET LIST

592crJUBgGc,Trouble Funk: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"May 30, 2018 | Abby O'Neill -- Go-go — Washington D.C.'s regional twist on funk — reigned in the DMV during the 1980s, and one of the scene's signature acts was Trouble Funk. More than 30 years later, the collective, led by Big Tony Fisher, still fills sold-out venues with heavyweight percussion and call-and-response lyrics. Trouble Funk concerts are bona fide jam sessions, so I was determined to squeeze their unrelenting rhythms behind the Tiny Desk.

With 12 members sandwiched into a cramped space, the electricity was almost tangible as they launched into the 1982 banger ""Pump Me Up,"" a song sampled in Public Enemy's protest anthem ""Fight the Power"" and M/A/R/R/S's dance classic ""Pump Up The Volume."" The drum breaks here are definitive go-go and it was hard to discern who was having more fun: the band or the audience. On ""Grip It,"" buoyant and staccato horn melodies propelled the song forward, while ""Let's Get Small"" featured Trouble Funk's classic call-and-response chants. ""Drop the Bomb,"" another notable gem from their lengthy discography, kept the energy level high and ""Don't Touch That Stereo"" was all raw, unencumbered funk. To conclude the set, they segued into ""E Flat Boogie,"" their first hit in 1979, with Big Tony's vocals front and center.

While the late Chuck Brown is often acknowledged as the godfather of go-go (and you can see why during his Tiny Desk), Trouble Funk was a key part of the sound's second wave. In a city often interrupted by the transient revolving door of government officials and federal staffers, the funky artform is woven into the fabric of this city and inspires a spirit of dance, rhythm and sheer joy.

9QT_A0HHjUA,Third Coast Percussion: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"May 29, 2018 | Tom Huizenga -- Back at the beginning of time, the human voice was the very first instrument. Probably close in second place were folks banging on stuff – in other words, percussionists. The quartet of gentlemen who form the Chicago-based Third Coast Percussion takes primordial pounding into a completely distinctive new league. To be sure, in this Tiny Desk performance, they'll play their sophisticated, modern marimbas and vibraphones, but be on the lookout for the subtleties of tuned cowbells and 3/4"" galvanized steel pipes, like those found at the local hardware store. Add to that a glockenspiel, a MIDI synth, a melodica, a drum kit, children's deskbells, crotales, a Thai gong and a singing bowl, and you've got significant noise-making potential behind Bob Boilen's desk.

The mesmerizing opening number, ""Niagara,"" written by the group, is from the band's latest album, the aqua-centric Paddle to the Sea. This water is fast-moving, with pulsing, repeating patterns in the vibraphone, punctuated by drum beats and a bed of low synth. The Third Coasters follow with another from the album, their own arrangement of a slowly rippling ode to the Amazon River by Philip Glass. Beginning with droplets on the glockenspiel and evocative bowing of both vibraphone and crotales (small bronze discs), the music flows softly, taking its time to fan out in all its quiet beauty.

Torched and Wrecked is, as David Skidmore mentions, something that once happened to his band mate Sean Connors' automobile. It's also a butt-kicking ride that includes those steel conduit pipes, which the band cuts to specific lengths to get the desired pitches. Skidmore wrote the piece, but it's Connors who appears to achieve a kind of cathartic glee pounding on the metal tubes.

In these performances the musicians prove that there's far more to a top-notch percussion ensemble than pounding on stuff. The precision and the subtlety of their soft tapping, bowing and conjuring of otherworldly sounds raises this ancient art to the highest level.

OXPfeg09IOE,Ill Camille: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"May 25, 2018 | Abby O'Neill -- Los Angeles rapper Ill Camille hooked me during my first trip through her sophomore album, Heirloom. Her lyrical prowess and storytelling were so moving, I immediately reached out to her on Instagram and asked if she would like to perform a Tiny Desk. ""Please don't make me cry right now. Tiny Desk!?!? You don't understand. I've been praying on this"", she replied. ""This (message) made my year and my band is ready!""

Ill Camille strays a bit from the hip-hop zeitgeist. She raps about love and family serving as the source of her strength, the importance of self-worth as a woman, and the necessity to nurture oneself from within. That core keeps her secure even when confronted by the despair of poverty and the difficult grind of a young artist. And you can hear all that front and center in her music.

Her voice is like a cool drink on a summer's day: smooth, clear and replenishing. Her refreshing self-awareness and raw honesty are inherent in each song, pairing nicely with the jazzy, melodic rhythms provided by her close knit crew of musicians. The first two songs, ""Spider's Jam"" and ""Live it Up,"" feature long time collaborators of Camille's, Iman Omari and drummer Greg Paul of Inglewood collective The Katalyst. Aneesa Strings, a bassist from the Bay Area, provided the low end foundation while also lending her rich vocals to ""Fight On."" Also, guesting on this song is fellow L.A. native and emcee Damani Nkosi, who's been rocking with Camille since her debut album, The Pre-Write. The four-song set concluded with the upbeat ""Again,"" an ode to happiness and self-actualization.

aWjihS2LHLs,Juanes & Mon Laferte: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"May 23, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- Colombian pop star Juanes and Chilean singer Mon Laferte recently wrapped up a sold-out tour of the United States, which (lucky for us) included a stop at the Tiny Desk.

Laferte began the concert solo with the torch song ""Pa' Dónde Se Fue"" (Where Did You Go?). She sang the break-up story with a smirk that belied the heartache hiding in her poignant lyrics. Then, after a short set break starring the Tiny Desk engineer Josh Rogosin, Juanes joined her to perform the duo's sultry single, ""Amárrame"" (Tie Me Up).

It's rare to see Juanes in such an intimate setting. After almost two decades of performing solo, the Latin pop star is more of a stadium and arena kind of guy. It's a treat to hear his voice unencumbered by loud speakers or crowd noise, and to see his facial expressions as he sings lyrics that many of us know by heart. This marked a return to the intimacy that fueled his earliest days and that's still present in the personal lyrics that have sold millions of records.

That intimacy was heightened by the presence of Laferte. The duo performed a PG-13 version of ""Amárrame,"" a passionate pop song with lyrics reminiscent of 50 Shades Of Grey. You can sense an obvious chemistry between the two during that song, as well as on the Juanes classic ""Fotografia"" (which originally featured Nelly Furtado).

Juanes closed out the concert solo with a stripped-down version of ""Es Tarde"" from his last album, Mis Planes Son Amarte. The performance demonstrates why Juanes and Laferte's duet tour sold out across the U.S. this year. There is a magic here that makes for repeated viewing. It's that much fun to watch.

sWlclUJhJx8,The Band's Visit: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"May 21, 2018 | Josh Rogosin -- After nearly 800 Tiny Desk concerts, The Band's Visit is the first Broadway musical ever to play the series.

The crew from the show, which opened last November at the Ethel Barrymore Theater, descended on NPR at 8:30 a.m. — seven musicians, five actors, a wardrobe department, a make-up artist, a publicist, a music director, the composer and even a vlogger. We started early so they could hustle back to Manhattan for a 7 p.m. curtain.

The story of The Band's Visit, composer David Yazbek told the Tiny Desk audience, ""is about hope and faith and silence and music."" It tells the tale of Egyptian musicians stranded in a small Israeli village. The townspeople have no choice but to take them in. Eventually, the love of music allows the characters to see past their differences and form an unlikely bond in a single night. The musical was adapted from the 2007 film and has been nominated for 11 Tony Awards.

From the first note strummed on the oud, Yazbek's nominated score transports the Tiny Desk to the Middle East with traditional instrumentation and melodies, and weaves in beautiful theatrical ballads.

Among the cast are Tony Shalhoub (known for his TV roles in Monk and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel) and Broadway veteran Katrina Lenk (Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark, Once and Indecent). They both have been nominated for their lead performances.

Although it's a Broadway smash hit, it lacks the opulent, bring-down-the-house song and dance numbers. It's a more intimate show with some universal messages that fit the up, close and personal space of the Tiny Desk.

The Band's Visit insists that it's OK, even essential, to get ""stuck"" with strangers who have different perspectives. It serves as a poignant reminder that our common connection to music can rise above the noise of intolerance.

Yazbek's poem Itgara'a, translated here from Arabic and sung a cappella by Tony Shalhoub, sums up the show's philosophy:

When you drink, drink deeply.

Drink deeply of the moonlight

drink deeply of the dark

of the loneliness

of the joy.

You will never drain the moonlight

you can never end the dark.

In your eyes, the flash of joy

in your mouth, the sweet shock of honey.

You are the joy

you are the loneliness.

Drink deep.

vWLJeqLPfSU,Khruangbin: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"May 16, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- It was daylight but the music was dark and moody. And despite having the office lights turned on high, it was Khruangbin's trance-inducing tone that set the mood and carried me away.

This trio from Houston, Texas is heavily inspired by 1960s and '70s funk and soul from, of all places, Thailand. That musical passion has taken them on a journey that, these days, incorporates music from Spain, Ethiopia and the Middle East. Khruangbin's largely instrumental music is grounded in Laura Lee's bass, with Mark Speer playing those melodic, richly reverbed guitar sounds and Donald ""DJ"" Johnson on drums and piano.

Two of the three songs performed at this Tiny Desk Concert are from their 2018 album Con Todo El Mundo, which is dedicated in part to Laura Lee's Mexican-American grandfather. He'd often ask her how much she loved him and the response that pleased him most was when she would say, ""con todo el mundo,"" (with all the world.)

The third track in this performance is one of the band's first forays into vocals, from their 2015 debut album, The Universe Smiles Upon You. ""White Gloves"" gently pays homage to a ""classy lady"" who was ""a fighter"" and who ""died in a fight."" Its open-ended lyrics could imply a battle that was violent or an illness. It isn't clear. What is clear is the reverence in the song and in this music — music that strays from typical instrumental songs with heavy beats. This is music to sway to and to lift you beyond the day to day.

rW0o-tXJXW0,Partner: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"May 18, 2018 | Robin Hilton -- This is one of the sweetest, funniest and most endearing Tiny Desk performances I've seen. From the moment they began playing, it was clear best friends Lucy Niles and Josée Caron, who perform as the Canadian rock band Partner, were there to leave their mark and have a whole lot of fun doing it.

Known for their sense of humor, joyful spirit and screaming riff rock, Partner opened their Tiny Desk not with their guitars plugged in, but with kazoos and a goofy little piano piece they dubbed the ""Tiny Desk Theme."" Dressed like she was in an ugly sweater contest, Caron bounced along behind the keys with a beaming smile while the group (including drummer Brendan Allison, Kevin Brasier on keys and Daniel Legere on guitar) sang, ""It's the best Tiny Desk!""

The impish left turns didn't stop there. Immediately following the makeshift theme, Caron peeled off her sweater (revealing a Tegan and Sara T-shirt) and grabbed an acoustic guitar as the band broke into its first-ever country song, a track they'd premiered at a live show just days earlier. They could barely contain their laughter while singing ""Tell You Off,"" a boom-chicka story song about giving a good tongue-lashing to anyone who gets in your way.

Partner closed out its set with a surprisingly emotional version of ""Creature In The Sun,"" a reflection on appreciating the gift of just being alive. About halfway through the song, Caron took a moment to tell the audience why it was so special to them. Choking back tears, she said she wrote it about freeing the mind of desire. ""It's a very healing place... And you can just experience the fullness of life. I just wanted to... remind everyone that that stuff is right there with you all the time.""

For a set that had been largely about laughter and playing around, it was one last surprise turn from one of my favorite new acts in recent years, and a fitting bookend to the many ways the band left its own mark on the Tiny Desk.

BfNlkqX7hlc,Bela Fleck And Abigail Washburn: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"May 11, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- A very pregnant Abigail Washburn points to Bela Fleck at the Tiny Desk and says ""and just so you know, this is his fault."" I won't spoil the video by telling you his response.

Bela Fleck and Abigail Washburn are two American musical treasures. This husband-and-wife banjo duo write original tunes steeped in the roots of folk music. Their playing is sweetly paced with melodies interweaving through their intricate, percussive picking all while Abigail soars above it all with her discerning, yearning voice.

Their first tune, ""Over the Divide,"" was written at the height of the Syrian Refugee Crisis. They'd read a story about a Jewish, yodeling, Austrian sheep herder who helped Syrians out of Hungary, through the backroads that likely only sheep herders know.

The second tune, ""Bloomin' Rose,"" is a response to Standing Rock and the Dakota pipeline that is seen as a threat to water and ancient burial grounds. The intensity and thoughtfulness in Bela Fleck's and Abigail Washburn's music is why it will shine for a good long while, the way great folk tunes stay relevant over the ages.

For the third tune, Abigail waddled over to a clogging board. And before she began her rhythmic patter, told us all that ""my doctor said that what I'm about to do is ok! I have compression belts and tights on that you can't see."" They then launched into ""Take Me To Harlan,"" another one of their songs from their 2017 album Echo In The Valley.

Both Bela and Abigail have come to the Tiny Desk separately in different musical configurations: Bela with Edgar Meyer on bass fiddle and Zakir Hussain on tabla, and Abigail with her band celebrating both American and Chinese traditions. But together they are a timeless power that must be witnessed.

42MiCMJ6DJU,Naia Izumi: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"May 14, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- I am so proud of our 2018 Tiny Desk Contest winner, Naia Izumi. The band he brought and the songs they played for this winning Tiny Desk Concert made us all even prouder.

Naia was chosen after we reviewed nearly 5,000 video entries. And the talent that came to us through all those submissions was astonishing. Naia Izumi won us over with his mind-boggling and unique style of guitar playing — a combination of tapping on the fingerboards and soul-filled whammy bar-note bending. And his multi-octave singing range blended so eloquently with his guitar stylings.

""Soft Spoken,"" the song he submitted, felt singular and unparalleled to our panel of judges which included past Tiny Desk contest winner Tarriona ""Tank"" Ball, Tiny Desk alum Sylvan Esso and Gaby Moreno, along with NPR family members Talia Schlanger (WXPN), Russ Borris (WFUV), Toki Wright (The Current) and the All Songs Considered team of Robin Hilton and myself. It's a song, as I hear it, that speaks to the power inherent in the gentle and quieter voices that are often drowned out by the outspoken and boisterous ones. Its title was originally ""Soft Spoken Woman"" and, as we later learned, Naia had identified as a woman for nearly seven years. More recently, as he said in an interview with Washingtonian Magazine, ""I'm not into that anymore because I just want to relax with biology and be comfortable with what I have.""

Naia is often a one-man band playing on the streets with a drum machine. But for his Tiny Desk Concert he brought bassist Adam Matijasevic and drummer Kynwyn Sterling. He'd met Kynwyn after submitting one of his songs to a math rock Facebook group. And that's the thing: Naia's music draws from so many spheres of sound. There's that punctual, rhythmic, mathematical pulse to what he does, but there's also a fluid, almost African Kalimba sound in there as well. They're two sounds I wouldn't often think of as coexisting.

We're about to go out on the road with Naia Izumi to 10 cities. We'll be joined by some of the other Contest entrants that captured our attention and they'll share the bill alongside Naia. And though there is only one Contest winner, we discovered so many other great talents that we hope to feature in the future.

Remember that the spirit of the Contest is intended to bring out the best in you, to gather with friends and to create. Thank you for being a part of something so filled with magic. It was an honor to watch what you created.

Oon_lSONbB0,Gordi: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"May 7, 2018 | Stephen Thompson -- Australian singer-songwriter Gordi (a.k.a. Sophie Payten) has a dusky and evocative voice that usually gets enshrouded somehow: It often sounds like it's echoing down a stairwell, or else she's bathed it in vocal effects a la Imogen Heap or Gordi's occasional tourmate, Justin Vernon of Bon Iver. But Payten's voice is an expressive and powerful instrument on its own, as her debut appearance behind the Tiny Desk demonstrates.

Aside from a bit of looping — in the strangely infectious notes that open ""Heaven I Know,"" from last year's terrific Reservoir — Gordi here keeps her voice both unadorned and centered within warm, cool arrangements that include piano, acoustic guitar, pedal steel, a harmonium named Barbara, a saxophone played by Yellow Ostrich's Alex Schaaf, and more. The effect here is rawer than on Reservoir, but that's part of the point: These songs stand up to being stripped down, every time.

I8sHrD48zPU,Darlingside: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"May 4, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- Even though the world will eventually come to an end, there's still beauty and hope in all of us and in song. That about sums up the wistful mystery that is the music of Darlingside. The quartet brought dystopian storytelling wrapped in choral harmony with this performance at the Tiny Desk. Their singing is layered on a bed of percussive and melodic tones, made with guitars both acoustic and electric, violin, cello, mandolin and a tiny synthesizer. For all its upfront simplicity, in voice and acoustics, Darlingside's Tiny Desk Concert has stuck with me as a most compelling performance — a perfect match of songwriting, with contributions from all members.

The first song they performed comes from the band's 2015 debut album Birds Say. ""The God of Loss"" was inspired by the Arundhati Roy book The God of Small Things, and by the main character's attempts to preserve humanity in the face of competing forces. The other two songs Darlingside performed are from Extralife, the Boston quartet's perfectly crafted third album: ""Best of the Best of Times"" and the title track ""Extralife."" That cut track starts off the album with these lines:

""It's over now
The flag is sunk
The world has flattened out
Under the under grow
I've always found
A level further down
As I begin to lose hold of
The fiery flowerbeds above
Mushroom clouds reset the sky
Extralife""

Through these end-of-time lyrics comes deep appreciation for what we have and what's worth holding on to. And through it all Darlingside's humor shines, with in-between chatter about quiche and common bonds. Don't miss this band's music. This is the perfect introduction to Darlingside, right here.

Eqme6GKr57U,GZA & The Soul Rebels: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"May 2, 2018 | Abby O'Neill -- GZA's performance at the Tiny Desk was a rare appearance for the legendary Wu-Tang Clan emcee, in part because he's notoriously introverted, and because he brought along The Soul Rebels, an eight-piece New Orleans brass ensemble. Once they stepped behind the desk they got right down to business, opening with the sparkling ""Living In The World Today,"" from GZA's 1995 solo album Liquid Swords. These 23-year old lyrics and metaphors felt timeless.

GZA continued his onslaught of poetic precision with another beauty from Liquid Swords, ""Duel of the Iron Mic."" ""I ain't particular,"" he spat, starting to break into a sweat behind the desk. ""I bang like vehicular/Homicides on July 4th in Bed-Stuy."" At one point, GZA even channeled his cousin, the late great Ol' Dirty Bastard, who provided the hook on the original version of the track.

Most rap fans would name RZA as the head of the Wu-Tang Clan. But Wu purists know that GZA, or The Genius, is the crew's unspoken elder statesman. By the third and final song at the Tiny Desk, driven by unbridled passion and his command of the room, GZA was soaked in sweat as they broke into the title track of Liquid Swords. The Soul Rebels perfectly recreated the track's seamless horn hits while adding on a bit of their own flare. The cherry on top arrived when GZA used his final minutes to tell the story of how the hook originally came together. In RZA's basement, smoking and drinking with fellow Wu lyricist Masta Killa, RZA was sold on a routine he, GZA and ODB used to perform as teens. But I'll leave it to him to tell you all about it in this unforgettable performance.

This set was recorded when The Soul Rebels were in Washington, D.C. for a performance at the 9:30 Club that featured GZA and Talib Kweli. It was one of just a handful of live concerts GZA has done with the group.

DDu4jk2_R_k,Bedouine: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"April 30, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- This is as spare as music can be – songs stripped to their essence and just gorgeous. Azniv Korkejian is Bedouine, a singer and acoustic guitarist who echoes sounds from the 1960's North American folk songwriters, but with vocal inflections that feel closer to Leonard Cohen than to Joni Mitchell or Joan Baez.

Azniv Korkejian was born in Aleppo Syria. Her parents were Armenian and she spent her childhood in Saudi Arabia. But a green card lottery win found her family moving to Boston and Houston. Eventually she made her way to Los Angeles with important time spent in Austin, Texas and Savannah, Ga. The name she chose, Bedouine, reflects the traveler, the wanderer in her.

For her first album, she teamed up with the folks from the Richmond, Va. label Spacebomb. Trey Pollard arranged some stunning subtly on her 2017 self-titled album. You may know his work from Natalie Prass, or maybe the music he wrote for the podcast S-Town. Matthew E. White, the label's founder and also a musician signed Bedouine to Spacebomb, and the album was produced by Gus Seyffert. And though I deeply love the album's sound, I was entranced by Azniv Korkejian's solo performance at my desk. It's a unembellished gateway to some gracefully adorned songs.

When I first heard ÌFÉ I was stopped in my tracks. Literally. I pulled the car over and just listened.

I recognized Afro-Cuban drumming and chanting, but it was coming at me with electronic furnishings that made their drums and vocals sound like a futuristic spiritual ceremony.

ÌFÉ is from Puerto Rico and feature a surprising back story. The group's debut album, IIII+IIII, is a fresh electronic take on tradition that's winning over even the most devout practitioners of the western African-based spiritual ceremonies that form the base of their music. That's hard to do with ritual music.

For their turn behind the Tiny Desk, Otura Mun and his ensemble unplug their drums for their first tune, an acoustic version of their ""House of Love (Ogbe Yekun)"". The sound of the second song here is what startled me when I heard the band's debut CD last year: the parts normally performed on Afro-Cuban bata drums and chekeres are electronically treated for a traditional prayer for the deity Oduduwa. By the last tune, ""Bangah (Pico Y Palo),"" the electronics have created a sonic playground that plays perfectly against the battery of Afro-Cuban rhythms.

Listen for the explainer during the performance by Otura Mun, who also gives a shout out to those struggling against the vestiges of colonialism still prevalent in Puerto Rico.

Read Alt.Latino's ÌFÉ primer.

2K49QKVR0p0,Superorganism: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"April 25, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- I went from really loving the music of Superorganism to being a transformed super-fan the moment they sent me an email ahead of their Tiny Desk performance asking, ""is it okay if we [bring] inflatable whales when we play?"" Now I feel like the kind of fan I was when I wore a yellow radiation suit to a Devo concert in 1978.

The multinational band of theatrically fun and talented musicians in Superorganism mix melody and mischievous with almost Seussian folly. In addition to the 20-plus inflatable whales they provided, the band requested via email that we provide ""7 x Crunchy apples, 7 x cans of Coca Cola (or similar, as long as they are 330mls/12oz cans it doesn't matter)."" They added, ""PLEASE NOTE THIS IS NOT A RIDER BUT PART OF THE PERFORMANCE.""

When the seven members of the band arrived and huddled behind my desk, they blew into straws, making percussive noises, used toy cars and radios for sound effects and added lots of handclaps. And in the midst of it all was Orono Noguchi, a small-framed, self-described ""average 17-year old Japanese girl living in Maine."" (That's from an email she wrote me last year). The band set up a couple of belt pack guitar amps for their Moog and electric guitar, along with a big Anvil road case to beat on for percussion – and then they sang about prawns.

""Oh, have you ever seen the prawn cause a world war?
Have you ever kissed a prawn; got a cold sore?
Have you ever seen a prawn kick off?
Have you ever seen a prawn in a pair of handcuffs, oh

You people make the same mistakes
Over and over, it's really kinda dumb, oh
Slow learning is kinda your thing

You do you, I'll do me

Chillin' at the bottom of the sea and I say...

[Chorus]

I'm happy just being a prawn.

If all this hasn't made you curious enough to watch this Tiny Desk, we'll never be friends and it's probably best if you skip this. But I'm going hit the play button again and, after that, listen again to their debut, self-titled album!

SET LIST

9UmWZEZakXQ,Logan Richardson: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"April 23, 2018 | Suraya Mohamed -- 
Logan Richardson's latest project, Blues People, is a condition, a state of being. The album was derived from the early slave calls that inspired the earliest American jazz and blues musical traditions. Here at the Tiny Desk, the saxophonist revisits that history with four remarkable songs from the album, all performed with a hope that our country's future will be less painful than its past.

""The thing for me is not being afraid to firmly stand on the shoulders of our forefathers, the ones that paved the way for us."" Richardson told NPR after the performance. ""I'd like this music to be an accumulation of everything involved with the historic tradition of jazz music, black American music, improvised music or whatever you want to call it.""

You can hear what Richardson means on the opening song, ""80's Child,"" a reflection on the decade Richardson was born. Its colorful melody complements the band's energetic fusion groove. Continually pushing forward with momentum and anticipation, its 8/8 time signature moves seamlessly into 10/8 to create an intensity that is both focused and free.

The next groove, ""The Settlement,"" maintains a similar tone and features DeAndre Manning slapping on his funky bass. The song gently segues into the only vocal piece, ""Black Brown & Yellow,"" a lovely reminder that racial diversity is something to celebrate.

""Anthem (To Human Justice)"" ends with brilliance best described by my colleague Nate Chinen, ""By design, too, Richardson's alto saxophone often functions more like a lead vocalist than as a virtuoso solo instrument. He's a good conduit for soaring, plaintive melody.... And however the band surges or thrashes around him, there's a feeling of urgent communion in this music.""

cniD94MqoCg,John Moreland: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"April 20, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- When you hear John Moreland's sweet voice, it's hard to believe he spent years singing in punk, metal-core and hardcore bands. You can still hear that passion in his music, only now it's punctuated by his acoustic guitar.

At the Tiny Desk, Moreland gave nod toward the more visceral side of his music when, about a minute into ""Old Wounds,"" he sang, ""if we don't bleed, it don't feel like a song."" It's a line I could imagine Steve Earle singing. In fact, John Moreland's dad was a big fan of Steve Earle. It's a style of storytelling and image-painting that John Moreland has been making with his guitar for at least the past ten years, over seven albums. His songs are filled with characters and tales of broken love and broken people.

Moreland and his musical partner John Calvin Abney kick off the Tiny Desk Concert with ""Sallisaw Blue,"" a song originally recorded in a bar in Moreland's hometown of Tulsa.

""Down for the count, along for the ride
Sipping cold medicine, ruining our lives
Slumming I-40 with American songs
They can bury our bodies in American wrongs""

This lead-off track to John Moreland's latest record, Big Bad Luv, is one of loneliness and pain but it comes from a talented man with a lot of heart, so it won't bring you down.

05EW61wUoLU,O.C.: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"April 18, 2018 | Abby O'Neill -- As a member of Brooklyn rap collective Diggin' In The Crates, Omar Credle, aka O.C., helped shape what was known as the golden age of 1990s rap. Marked by loops sourced from jazz recordings and lyrics rooted in one-upmanship, O.C's two '90s albums, Word...Life and Jewelz established him as a rapper's rapper, an underground star.

O.C. was joined at his Tiny Desk by Soul'D U Out, a jazz ensemble led by Grammy-winning trumpeter Maurice ""Mobetta"" Brown. The live instrumentation replicated the sample-heavy original recordings perfectly. The crew kicked off the concert with ""New Day,"" from O.C.'s 2017 album Same Moon Same Sun, which features young R&B singer Tay Bell on the hook.

The rest of the set was vintage cuts from O.C.'s heyday. ""Day One,"" a D.I.T.C. posse cut, featured emcee and producer Lord Finesse, and the joy that poured forth during his verse belied its level of difficulty. (It reminded me that it'd been too long since I enjoyed a Lord Finesse album.) Then O.C. treated the crowd to a version of ""Return of the Crooklyn Dodgers"" (the one and only song by him, Jeru The Damaja and Chubb Rock). And of course, he had to fit in his seminal banger and arguably most popular song, ""Time's Up,"" from Word...Life.

The finale got personal when O.C. relayed the importance of the song ""Born 2 Live."" ""This is dedicated to a friend of mine who got killed down in Baltimore,"" he said. ""Everytime I do this record, it's somber. ... But it's a celebration at the same time. So I'm a just party it out and have a good time with it."" With a little help from Soul'D U Out, we did, too.

CHMZW9kLpg0,The Breeders: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"April 16, 2018 | Lars Gotrich -- After many iterations, hiatuses and returns, The Breeders will always be Kim Deal's band, with her sister Kelley at her side. They return this year to an old lineup, with all the promise (and old wounds) it brings. But you can see a renewed love and goofiness throughout this set — using a roadie as a crash cymbal, or Kim Deal's faux-exasperation at Josephine Wiggs for starting a wind-up toy just before a song.

The same group behind the band's breakout, 1993 Last Splash — a sugar-smacked, alt-pop album that sounded like nothing else in the underground pushed to rock radio — just released All Nerve in March. Now bassist Wiggs and drummer Jim Macpherson join Kim and Kelley Deal for this Tiny Desk Concert.

""Somehow, between the four of us getting in the basement [and] playing together again, it all just felt exactly the same as the good times before everything,"" Kelley Deal told NPR. ""It was just really fun.""

The new songs don't have the same punch as Last Splash; rather, they are wizened, frazzled and, with a generous mix of crunch and dreamy scuzz, explore themes of encroaching isolation and dissatisfaction. The Breeders play two songs from All Nerve — the lysergic ""MetaGoth"" and the gorgeously strange and sweet title track — plus ""Off You"" from 2002's Title TK, an excellent album worth revisiting if you haven't listened in a while. It's a reminder that, while you can hear the raw charm of The Breeders in younger bands, no one still quite sounds like them.

qn6rgisZm1M,Jorge Drexler: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"April 13, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- Jorge Drexler is a poet with a gift for song. The Uruguayan singer-songwriter, like the iconic Latin American lyricists of the past (Mercedes Sosa, Victor Jara and Silvio Rodriguez, to name just a few), has that rare ability to surround multi-layered prose with music that lends an even deeper resonance to the words.

Drexler has his share of fans here in the U.S., mostly Latin American expats and others whose grasp of the language allows them to appreciate the nuances of his storytelling. But, as if often the case with music performed in languages other than English, audiences here sometimes miss out on an emotional connection with artists they would otherwise celebrate if they only knew what they were singing.

So, we decided to do something about that with Jorge Drexler's appearance at the Tiny Desk. With the cooperation of the artist, we translated Drexler's thoughtful and playful ruminations on the human condition, and included them as subtitles.

Those clever lyrics wouldn't hit as hard if not for Drexler's backing band of magicians. The mix of guitarists and percussionists conjured a stunning cloud of sound that allowed Drexler to take flight, like the existential dreamer that he is.

lkDYKk9k-2E,Tyler Childers: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"April 11, 2018 | Lars Gotrich -- Tyler Childers writes songs about hard lives and hard love with direct heart. You meet these characters — some from his own life, some not — and feel like you know them, but there's always another layer to uncover with each listen, carved by his coarse and soulful Kentucky drawl.

In his performance at the Tiny Desk, we meet a miner and the consequences of addiction (""Nose on the Grindstone""), Childers' own in-laws (""This is a song about the first time I got snowed in with my in-laws,"" he says, expecting a laugh, and giving it a beat. ""It's not a blues song, it's a love song""), and the love of his life, ""Lady May."" Only the closing song comes from last year's Purgatory, his proper debut record, produced by Sturgill Simpson. The others are regular features in Childers' live repertoire for now, but lived in and alive, ready for us to dig deep.

9-0f3bKQyAw,Lara Bello: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"April 10, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- Lara Bello occupies the space between genres where magic happens. Born in Spain, she was raised with not only Spanish traditions like flamenco and canto but also pop music and jazz. The instrumentation she assembled for her Tiny Desk reflects that elastic approach to genre: acoustic classical guitar, clarinet, violin and a percussionist who didn't keep time so much as color the proceedings.

After just three albums, Bello has become a noteworthy presence in the community of Spanish musicians who deftly mix jazz, classical and other traditions from Spain. That world can seem like a secret society to those who don't understand Spanish, but you'll see during Bello's performances that the lyrics double as another flight of exploration as they float like wisps of smoke through the sonic spaces carved out by her collaborators.

YkkKUARRpeU,Rhye: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"April 9, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- It seemed only fitting that when Rhye performed the band's Tiny Desk Concert that it be at night, illuminated by flickering light. The music Mike Milosh sings and writes conjures the evening and a swaying, romantic vibe.

It was five years ago nearly to the day that we filmed Rhye by candlelight in New York City as the band toured for its enigmatic album Woman. Mike Milosh requested that Rhye's members be filmed ""only in silhouette, with the lights dimmed low"" at Le Poisson Rouge show.

This time around the hundred or so flickering lights set the tone for the sextet of strings, keyboard, guitar, bass and drums to perform music from 2018's Blood. The sound is warm and velvety, all the instruments gently pulsing, as Mike Milosh softly sings with that high-pitched yearn.

Tiny Desk Concerts are often awkward by nature — bands playing in the middle of an office in the daytime for musicians used to playing in the evening, with stage lighting. But there was a special transformation that took place at this Tiny Desk the moment the music kicked in. I'm a sucker for a vibe in music — that feeling when a sound completely shifts the mood of a room. This vibe was more like a house show than an office, which put me in a pensive, pleasant place. Sit back and enjoy.

xkBeytzAHy0,Dan Auerbach: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"April 4, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- The last time Dan Auerbach came to the Tiny Desk he brought a mariachi band (we supplied confetti cannons). That was our 500th performance at the Tiny Desk, with Dan playing alongside his band The Arcs.

This time out, we have a different kind of celebration — and an explosion of talent — as Dan brings his Easy Eye Sound Revue to the Tiny Desk. It's an abundance of gifted musicians who have all played with a long, long list of legends, including Elvis, Don Williams and John Prine. Their set recalls a time and sound from the '60s when southern R&B, including Nashville, was a force.

Midway through the four-song set (that includes tunes from his 2017 album Waiting on a Song), Dan introduces a powerhouse: the seasoned but relatively unknown blues-and-soul singer Robert Finley. The husky voiced gentleman, with a giant smile and magical charisma, is heart-winning and heart-warming. It's remarkable that this legally blind singer is only now getting the attention he deserves. Hopefully this inspires you to go digging to hear the album Robert Finley and Dan Auerbach released at the end of 2017 called Goin' Platinum.

For those of you who saw the recent Tiny Desk Concert from fellow Nashville musician John Prine, you may remember John telling tales of writing songs with Pat McLaughlin in the morning, going to town for some meatloaf and then recording the song by day's end. Well that's Pat on the mandolin here in this Tiny Desk set. His playing is both astonishing and low-key. The small band for this stripped-down version of the ""Revue"" is fleshed with Dante Schwebel on guitar and Russ Pahl's resonator guitar sounds.

Dan Auerbach is a master of ceremonies, a community maker and a great songwriter. His world is one where it's hard to tell if this pool of talent has gathered around to join Dan, or if he's managed to reconnect some old magic in hopes of going along for a great ride himself. Either way we win.

nXdC5D2PqoU,Dee Dee Bridgewater: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"April 2, 2018 | Suraya Mohamed -- ""This is me coming back full circle in my life,"" Dee Dee Bridgewater told NPR right before this Tiny Desk performance. Ever since her teenage years, she's wanted to make her latest album, Memphis... Yes, I'm Ready. Now, a gorgeous 67 years young, Bridgewater is connecting openly with her roots, her birthplace and the town she's loved all her life.

When she was just three years old, her family moved from Memphis, Tennessee, to Flint, Michigan. Years later, Bridgewater could still hear the soul sounds of Memphis on WDIA, the first radio station in America programmed entirely by African-Americans for African-Americans. She recalled, ""I could catch it when I was in Flint as a teenager and I would listen to it after 11:00 at night, because that was the only time I could get it — when all the other stations were off the air. I know it was real, 'cause I went through it and these were all songs I heard on WDIA.""

Bridgewater brought three of these songs to the Tiny Desk: First, is the celebrated blues hit, ""Hound Dog,"" first recorded by not by Elvis Presley but by Willie Mae ""Big Mama"" Thornton in 1952. What makes this presentation special is not only Bridgewater's sultry and soulful interpretation, but her adorable Daisy, perhaps the cutest ""Hound Dog"" to ever bless this song.

The first lines of the next tune will quite actually send chills down your spine. Bridgewater and backup singers Sharisse Norman and Shontelle Norman-Beatty's close harmonic voicings add a spiritual dimension to the already hallowed song. ""Why (Am I Treated So Bad)?"" was written by Roebuck ""Pops"" Staples in response to the harassment of the Little Rock Nine, brave students who decided they had the right to attend an all-white Arkansas high school in 1957.

Last here is ""B.A.B.Y."" Bridgewater recorded this song and the entire album in Memphis' historic Royal Studios and told NPR this story, ""I stepped outside of the studio right after they started mixing 'B.A.B.Y.' and I said a prayer. I said, 'God I need a sign, that I'm moving in the right direction because I am completely stepping completely away from jazz music.'"" Before Bridgewater could get back into the studio to record the next track she got a surprise visit from Carla Thomas, the Memphis soul queen herself and daughter of Rufus Thomas, influential entertainer, singer-songwriter and former WDIA radio DJ. It was a true return to her Memphis roots, a memorable and beautiful moment for Bridgewater.

3CxvB0d5VF0,Masta Ace: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"March 30, 2018 | Abby O'Neill -- An early member of producer Marley Marl's iconic Juice Crew, the Brooklyn-bred Masta Ace emerged shoulder-to-shoulder in the late-'80s with a host of iconic emcees, including Big Daddy Kane, Kool G Rap, Craig G and more. When Ace showed up at the Tiny Desk, he brought with him stripped-down versions of the concrete-shaking classics that built his legacy, backed by the impressive Lee Hogans & Pursuance band.

Watch him move the crowd with his biggest single, ""Born To Roll,"" from the 1993 album SlaughtaHouse, and introspect on a life lived in the public eye on ""Story Of Me.""

In the elevator, minutes after wrapping, one of his bandmates noticed that he'd gotten a little emotional during the performance. Ace relayed that the intimacy of the Tiny Desk set had allowed him to hear anew the personal nature of the lyrics he'd shared about his late mother; a bittersweet nostalgia that's palpable during his performance of ""Son of Yvonne.""

It's that ability — to realize the moment, and to wield it — that makes Ace resonate so readily, from '80s Brooklyn to NPR.

Set List

""Son of Yvonne""
""Born To Roll/Jeep Ass Nig**""
""Story of Me""

7WNmrsbu-hc,I'm With Her: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"March 28, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- The three singers who perform together as I'm With Her sound like sisters. It's as if they've known each other all their lives and share common roots and musical memories.

Aoife O'Donovan, Sarah Jarosz and Sara Watkins are bound by a love for bluegrass, chamber music, jazz, storytelling and singing. Each of these three musicians, now united under the I'm With Her name, have performed at the Tiny Desk before. Sara Watkins was here with Nickel Creek (2014), Watkins Family Hour (2015) and The Decemberists (2011). Sarah Jarosz was here in 2013 and Aoife O'Donovan came along with Yo Yo Ma and Chris Thile as part of the Goat Rodeo project back in 2011.

All three are brilliant players with an ever-shifting array of stringed instruments, guitars, ukulele, fiddle, mandolin and banjo. As I'm With Her, they know how to gather round a microphone and sing directly from their heart to yours. Purity is the brilliance behind I'm With Her.

The three songs they perform here come from the trio's debut album, See You Around. It's a sound made for the intimacy of the Tiny Desk and they all feel right at home.

yng5CTT8Ogk,Jenny and the Mexicats: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"March 26, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- Jenny and the Mexicats is a discovery from South by Southwest a few years ago that I haven't been able to get out of my mind, and with good reason: The band's high energy shows are unforgettable, as is its sound. Mixing flamenco, originally from southern Spain, with Jenny Ball's jazz trumpet background and a little bit of cumbia has created their one-of-a-kind musical identity.

The grooves these musicians create can be frenetic (as in the first performance here, ""Frenético Ritmo"") or slow and luxurious (""The Song for the UV Mouse House""). In both cases, the group presents the perfect cushion for Ball's impassioned singing and engaging stage presence. There are no weak points in the instrumentation, and with Ball out front, the songs come to life as the short stories they are — like that of the young lady who appreciates a beer before taking on life's challenges in ""Verde Más Allá.""

Watching this performance, it's easy to see why Jenny and the Mexicats is picking up new fans as the group travels the world spreading its good cheer. The musicians bring their festival circuit-level performance down to almost a whisper here, but the intensity of their playing remains. After watching, perhaps you'll end up like me, with their names permanently entered in your mental Rolodex.

uQAQg7F89DY,Robin Olson: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Editor's note on April 2, 2018: You may have figured this out already — this video was an April Fools' joke. It's not real. We hope you enjoyed it.

April 1, 2018 | Tom Huizenga -- ""Not all pianists are created in equal temperament,"" Robin Olson told a small but enthusiastic audience behind NPR Music's storied Tiny Desk. The pianist, hailed as an ""avant-garde gewandhaus"" by Berlin's Staubzeitung, is as celebrated for his cryptic maxims as he is for his inscrutable music.

Olson's trademark style — shooting clusters of shimmering chords and solitary, pearlescent pitches into reverberant space — has led him to exalted concert halls and to work with a broad array of stars such as Yuja Wang, Aretha Franklin, Chick Corea and Emanuel Ax.

Drawing from the seminal Plink technique, cultivated among the Schlammstadt School of composers in the 1950s, Olson is regarded as a leading technician of the more expansive Neo-Plink style. ""Intervals have coincident partials,"" Olson explains. ""They create a form of dissonance, called 'beats,' by which pitches are set for optimum harmonicity.""

From a bulging briefcase, Olson pulls out any number tools to alter specific pitches, as in his opening piece, ""A 440."" He threads ribbons of felt between piano strings to mimic the muted cries of the Asian dung beetle in ""The Temperament,"" from his 2014 collection Infinite Chasms.

Olson surprised everyone at the Tiny Desk by debuting a new piece, ""Tuning the Bass,"" wherein his inventive command of the instrument's lower register highlighted spaces between keening dark octaves.

He may be considered a challenging artist, but Olson, through the essential humanity of his performance, reveals the efforts of almost any other living pianist to be little more than a joke.

hrAILI4-25M,Väsen: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"March 23, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- 
There's an abundance of jubilation and glee in the strums, trills, double stops and drones from the Swedish instrumental band Väsen. The trio came to the Tiny Desk with just three instruments, but all together it was a 30-string sonic blast of 12-string guitar, viola and nyckelharpa (a fiddle with keys — think 15th century keytar).

Guitarist Roger Tallroth, violist Mikael Marin and nyckelharpist Olov Johansson have been a touring troupe for more than 25 years with 18 albums filled with adventure, amusement and virtuosity. They span the wide emotional range of Swedish folk music, equally haunting and celebratory. There are some similarities to Irish jigs, reels and waltzes that I'm more familiar with, but this music is more ear-bending, with more surprises than I'm used to in traditional string band folk music.

Hopefully these tunes, many from Väsen's recent album Brewed — songs steeped in the past with its ears on the future — become a gateway for new listeners.

1gxm_5cShUw,Cornelius: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"March 19, 2018 | Lars Gotrich -- As Cornelius, Keigo Oyamada has stretched his vision across frenzied indie rock, lush '60s-style pop, psychedelic funk and glitched electronics, all deconstructed and reassembled like a neon cubist-pop sculpture. After a little more than two decades, no one can really imitate his complex cool.

Sporting a pair of sunglasses (always), Oyamada recently brought his band from Japan to the Tiny Desk on a rare U.S. tour, including his longtime collaborator and former Pizzicato Five member Hiroshisa Horie, drummer Yuko Araki (Mi-Gu, Cibo Mato's live band) and synthesist Yumiko Matsumura (Buffalo Daughter). They're all musicians who tease and poke at music's fringe territory, but still know how to make a song buzz and pop with gleeful curiosity.

Here, Cornelius performs three very different songs from last year's Mellow Waves. There's the robotic groove of ""Helix/Spiral,"" which repeats and mutates the same phrase and melodic fragments in a delicate and strange dance. ""In a Dream"" is a star-swept landscape that invites the subconscious to search for meaning, its keyboard flourishes and light acoustic strums so breezy you could almost call it a kind of retro-futuristic yacht rock. But set closer ""If You're Here"" is the real marvel to behold live, as the band performs at different tempos, gradually solving a polyrhythmic puzzle of a slow jam. The song also features one of my favorite guitar solos in recent memory — it's unflashy, but twists, spits and resolves in the most unexpected ways.

x9qEmmPSHs8,Raul Midón: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"March 15, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- Raul Midón lives in a world of sound — blind since birth, Midón's interpretation of his surroundings is borderless. He sings with the passion of the best classic soul singers, and his instrumental chops stand along side the most accomplished jazz musicians.

Normally backed by a band that straddles styles just as well as he does, for his turn behind Bob Boilen's desk Midón stripped it down to just voice and guitar, the musical equivalent of tightrope walking without a net.

You could choose any of the songs he performed, listen on repeat and continuously discover layers of musicality — the nuance of a bent note in his vocals, a burst of perfectly placed guitar notes.

Raul Midón has the respect of the most well-known and accomplished musicians in music, names like Stevie Wonder and George Benson. And, for a too-brief moment, we were lucky enough to hold us all enthralled, too.

Now it's your turn! Enjoy.

sOg7mAkrKJw,John Prine: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"March 12, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- An American treasure came to the Tiny Desk and even premiered a new song. John Prine is a truly legendary songwriter. For more than 45 years the 71-year-old artist has written some of the most powerful lyrics in the American music canon, including ""Sam Stone,"" ""Angel From Montgomery,"" ""Hello In There"" and countless others.

John Prine's new songs are equally powerful and he opens this Tiny Desk concert with ""Caravan of Fools,"" a track he wrote with Pat McLaughlin and Dan Auerbach. Prine adds a disclaimer to the song saying, ""any likeness to the current administration is purely accidental."" That song, and his second tune, the sweet tearjerker ""Summer's End,"" are from John Prine's first album of new songs in 13 years, The Tree of Forgiveness, produced by Dave Cobb. It was recorded with his longtime band in Nashville's legendary RCA Studio A. Guests include Brandi Carlile, Jason Isbell and Amanda Shires. There's even a songwriter's co-credit with Phil Spector.

For this Tiny Desk Concert John Prine also reaches back to his great ""kiss-off"" song from 1991 called ""All the Best,"" and then plays ""Souvenirs,"" a song intended for his debut full-length but released the following year on his 1972 album Diamonds in the Rough. It's just one of the many sentimental ballads Prine has gifted us. Over the years, his voice has become gruffer and deeper, due in part to his battle with squamous cell cancer on the right side of his neck, all of which makes this song about memories slipping by feel all the more powerful and sad.

""Broken hearts and dirty windows
Make life difficult to see
That's why last night and this mornin'
Always look the same to me
I hate reading old love letters
For they always bring me tears
I can't forgive the way they rob me
Of my sweetheart's souvenirs""

John Prine's latest album, The Tree Of Forgiveness, is due out April 13 on Oh Boy Records. It's available for pre-order from John Prine's official web site, iTunes and Amazon.

kWg2nMJkO5Y,Kuinka: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"March 9, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- Every year for the past four years we've had a Tiny Desk Contest (there's one going on right now), and though only one band can officially win the competition, thousands enter. I inevitably end up discovering so much wonderful music while going through the submissions.

Last year I came across Kuinka (coo-WINK-uh), a band from Seattle, and fell in love. So, when we held a Tiny Desk party in Seattle last May, with our partner station KEXP, we invited Kuinka (and other local bands) to play. Kuinka's live performance knocked me out even more than the creative video they'd submitted for the contest.

Since then, Brothers Zach and Nathan Hamer, along with Miranda Zickler and Jillian Walker, have come to D.C. for an official performance at the Tiny Desk, bringing with them their great harmonies and unique blend of energetic, string-band music with a dose of synth.

The songs are performed here on relatively tiny instruments, including a ukulele, a drum pad, a small synth, a mandolin and a banjo, along with an electric guitar. But the performance is fleshed out beautifully with rousing vocal harmonies.

All three tracks performed here are from Kuinka's 2017 EP Stay Up Late, and each one has its own charm. Make sure you stay to the end because ""Mistakenly Brave"" is the most stirring of the bunch.

Y2N9R9CDEZk,Alex Clare: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"March 7, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- Even before The Beatles recorded their own version of ""Twist and Shout,"" British fascination with American soul music has run deep. Vocalist and songwriter Alex Clare is yet another soul disciple from the UK, and his visit to Bob Boilen's desk is the perfect setting to bask in the power of his voice.

Clare has made a lot of noise in relatively little time, having released his first album in 2011. For a variety of reasons, he was not able to capitalize on the strength of his debut and lost his record deal — but after Microsoft picked up one of his songs for an international ad campaign, he was soon back in the studio.

The first song in this Tiny Desk performance, ""Three Hearts,"" is a love song dedicated to the moment he heard the heartbeat of his first child coming from his wife's sonogram. Backed by a tight four-piece band, Clare's tale of his family's road to domestic tranquility captures the joy as well as the uncertainty of impending parenthood. In the song ""Caroline,"" he inhabits the words with passion and heartfelt pleading, bringing to mind some of the best soul shouters, completely lost in the sentiment of the lyric.

Clare's personal story of a spiritual dedication to Judaism touches everything he writes, and as his career has professed, he has continued to produce songs that ask us to probe our own emotions through the lens life's bigger pictures. His Tiny Desk Concert is a glimpse at a musician capturing all of that complexity in a performance steeped in the passion of soul, one that mesmerizes and inspires at the same time.

_8xj2qp6yls,Big K.R.I.T.: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"March 5, 2018 | Rodney Carmichael -- Grandmothers never truly die. Especially not when they bear as much influence on your life as Big K.R.I.T.'s grandmother has on his. The Mississippi spitter has kept her spirit alive through his music since his breakout mixtape, K.R.I.T. Wuz Here, which he released the same year she passed in 2010.

So it only makes sense that he would bring her with him for his Tiny Desk concert.

Halfway through his three-song set at NPR Music headquarters, K.R.I.T. stops to pull out an old-school tape recorder — the same one his grandmother would use to record him singing and reciting poetry as a child. ""I have to feel like my grandmother was my first mix engineer,"" he says before pressing play to reveal he and his brother as kids singing a duet of R&B crooner Donell Jones' 1999 slow burner, ""Where I Wanna Be.""

It's a sublime interlude — one that resonated so strongly with K.R.I.T. that he had to start his last song, ""Bury Me In Gold,"" over to catch the proper beat. ""I'm super emotional from this, too,"" he says, laughing in a moment so genuine it was only right to leave it unedited.

K.R.I.T.'s Tiny Desk came on the heels of 4eva Is a Mighty Long Time, a double album in which he covers everything from blessings to depression while plumbing the carnal and spiritual depths of his own duality. All three songs performed here come from side two, titled after his birth name Justin Scott, as his grandmother refers to him on the cassette tape.

Her voice isn't the only special guest in the building. K.R.I.T.'s backing band, which includes Burniss Travis II on bass and Justin Tyson on drums, also features on keys Bryan Michael Cox — the hitmaking producer and songwriter behind a slew of Billboard chart-toppers (Mariah Carey, Usher, Mary J. Blige). Together, the trio delivers stripped-down versions of the latest thought-provoking material in Big K.R.I.T.'s catalog. And when he stops to pay homage to his church-going grandmother before performing ""Keep The Devil Off,"" it's clear that everything she instilled in him is keeping him alive, too.

36FNJiP8GWk,Anna Meredith: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"March 2, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- Out of nearly 700 performances at the Tiny Desk, this is simply the most exhilarating one I've experienced. The instrumentation is unusual, with pulsing bass sounds produced by a wonderful combination of cello, tuba and electronics. It's all rhythmically propelled by an astonishing drummer and Meredith pounding a pair of floor toms. And much of the repetitive melody is keyboard-and-guitar-driven that morphs and erupt with earth-shaking fervor.

I first saw this British composer a year ago, in a stunning performance at the SXSW musical festival. It was one of the best concerts of my life. The music I heard sent me into a state of reverie. If music could levitate my body, this is how it would sound. It carried me away and thrilled my soul. I was giddy for days.

Now, I know this isn't music for everyone. Lovers of classical music might shun it for its use of sequencers and electronics. The electronic world may wonder how the hell you could ever dance to this. Or for lovers of rock and hip-hop, its repetition and throbbing beats and bass might send you running and screaming into the distance. But if you know and love the music of Philip Glass, King Crimson or Steve Reich — music that's electrifying, challenging and sonically soars and ripples through your body — then crank this up.

Anna Meredith was a former BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra Composer in Residence. The songs performed here come from her 2016 release called Varmints, which is where two of the three songs performed here can be found. It's been a long while since a contemporary composer has captured my musical imagination. I hope and trust this will open many to a new way of thinking about what music is and what it can do.

CghK8iVUHBs,Roy Ayers: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"March 1, 2018 | Abby O'Neill -- Roy Ayers arrived at his Tiny Desk performance beaming with positivity. The 77-year-old funk icon and vibraphonist sauntered through the office with a Cheshire grin on his face, sharing jokes with anyone within earshot. Accompanying him was a trio of brilliantly seasoned musicians — keyboardist Mark Adams, bassist Trevor Allen and drummer Christopher De Carmine. Later during the performance, pride washed across Ayers' face as his bandmates took the spotlight. (Be sure to watch as Adams woos not just the room but brightens Ayers' face during his solo.)

The set began with one of Ayers' more recognizable hits: an extended version of ""Searching,"" a song that embodies the eternal quest for peace and love. During ""Black Family"" (from his 1983 album Lots Of Love), you'll hear him call out ""Fela"" throughout. That's because Afrobeat legend Fela Kuti was a huge influence on Ayers in the late 1970s; the two eventually collaborated on an album, 1980's Music Of Many Colors. ""Black Family"" is, in part, a tribute to Fela, even if the original version didn't include his name.

Concluding this mini-concert, Ayers closed the set out with his signature tune, ""Everybody Loves the Sunshine"", a feel-good ode if there ever was one. The essence of this song flowed right through him and out to the NPR audience.

kDRd0CEneOU,Lee Ann Womack: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Feb. 26, 2018 | Lyndsey McKenna -- Lee Ann Womack occupies rare terrain in country music. Though massively popular singles led to commercial success and widespread recognition, these days, she's working on the fringes of the genre. Her 2017 record, The Lonely, The Lonesome & The Gone, evokes the country music of Womack's Texas upbringing as the daughter of a country radio DJ, name-checking Hank Williams and covering George Jones.

At the Tiny Desk, the emotional storytelling and unparalleled vocal ability that anchor the album are all the more immediate. No bystander was impervious to the stormy and soaring ""All The Trouble,"" and the affecting lyrics of ""Mama Lost Her Smile"" felt even more intimate and unguarded when performed just feet from the audience. ""That's just good old country music story songs,"" she explained.

Steeped in tradition but singular in its expression, Womack's timeless performance tapped into the emotional core of country, and transcended our cluttered office space in the process.

SET LIST
""All the Trouble""
""Mama Lost Her Smile""
""Hollywood""

ZPuU39-PYjQ,Vagabon: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Feb. 23, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- Laetitia Tamko, the artist known as Vagabon, is a 25-year-old, Cameroon-born musician with a big, tenor voice just bursting with new musical ideas. I've seen her as a solo artist, with a band and, here at the Tiny Desk, both solo and with a bassist.

Her pride shines bright in her smile and as well it should. For someone self-taught and who's been playing for only the past four years, her arrangements are adept and thoughtful in an independent rock music scene that can often be lyrically lazy and texturally tepid.

Vagabon's poetry speaks to love. You can hear it in ""Cold Apartment."" While she closes the Tiny Desk set with it, it was the first song she ever wrote and one that came to her during a difficult time in her life.

""And we sat on my cold apartment floor
Where we thought we would stay in love
Stay in love""

Though all the songs here are about love, Vagabon also speaks proudly to black women on her 2017 album, Infinite Worlds. There aren't a lot of black women in this bedroom studio community of independents, a community that, especially in New York, has welcomed her and where she mostly found stimulus and guidance.

We were also treated to a new song during this Tiny Desk performance called ""Full Moon In Gemini,"" which, coincidentally, was performed on the day of a total lunar eclipse in Leo - she warned us all to ""watch yourselves.""

One of the attractions for me as I curate artists to perform behind my office desk, is to bring budding talent to the fore. And while Vagabon's songs are compelling, I see an even brighter future filled with inspiring poetry, imagery and sound that will be a light for many of us as listeners and those just beginning to explore thought and expression through songwriting.

y5p8Bmv0NSQ,"August Greene (Common, Robert Glasper, Karriem Riggins): NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","Feb. 21, 2018 | Abby O'Neill -- August Greene, the collaborative effort of Common, Robert Glasper and Karriem Riggins, was born at the White House in 2016 during a special Tiny Desk concert. It was during that unprecedented performance that the then-untitled ensemble premiered the powerful ""Letter to the Free,"" an original song for Ava DuVernay's Netflix documentary 13th that eventually won an Emmy for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics.

For the trio's first visit to NPR headquarters, they brought some special guests: vocalists Brandy, Maimouna Youssef and Andra Day. The band performed four tracks from its upcoming self-titled album (out March 9 on Amazon Music), an impromptu freestyle, and Day's Oscar-nominated collaboration with Common, ""Stand Up For Something,"" from the film Marshall. Common described the theme of the Tiny Desk as ""Foregrounding Women,"" alluding to the attendance of Brandy, Day and Youssef, as well as the spiritual presence of Glasper's younger cousin, Loren, who passed just a few days prior.

The past year has been a pivotal time for women, between #MeToo and social and financial equality, and the lyrics to these songs frame women's contemporary frustrations as civil rights issues. That's important in hip-hop, which has long been dogged by an old-line adherence to misogyny, as it lays claim to the world's most popular genre.

In a spontaneous moment midway through Maimouna Youssef's verse on ""Practice,"" the crowd gushed and you could see the joy in her eyes. Then the ebullient pop icon Brandy reprised Sounds Of Blackness' 1991 classic ""Optimistic,"" and the magic held everyone rapt. Andra Day followed up with ""Stand Up for Something""; her powerful voice blew the hinges off the doors.

August Greene's latest single, ""Black Kennedy,"" connotes dreams of an African-American dynasty, the kind only a royal family assumes. The stark contrasts of disenfranchisement are highlighted by every wish expressed. Later, in ""Let Go,"" vocalist and August Greene collaborator Samora Pinderhughes sings of overcoming darkness within yourself and finding hope at the bottom of Pandora's box. It's about releasing the demons so the hands can hold the blessings.

August Greene is what happens when talent embraces intention and humility. This edition of the Tiny Desk inspired me, its audience, and the artists behind the stage. We hope it has the same effect on you.

SET LIST
• ""Black Kennedy"" (feat. Samora Pinderhughes)

p8Uw1cl4xjg,Big Daddy Kane: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Feb. 19, 2018 | Abby O'Neill -- One of the greatest to ever bless the mic, Big Daddy Kane treated Tiny Desk to an office block party in the true essence of hip-hop. He performed a short set of classics, including ""Smooth Operator,"" ""Ain't No Half Steppin',"" ""Raw"" and a bonus freestyle. Through his warm, engaging and devilishly self-effacing style, the pioneer used an interlude between songs to address the intergenerational divisiveness defining rap today and the importance of fans of all ages supporting whatever they like, while ""focusing on what's positive and keeping that in the spotlight.""

Kane, aka Dark Gable, was a breakout member of the seminal Juice Crew in hip-hop's golden era during the latter part of the 1980s. He popularized quick-cadence flows and multisyllabic rhyme schemes before passing the torch to early mentees like Jay-Z. Many a night during my adolescence was spent trying to memorize the baritone MC's lyrics. During those sessions, I could only feel sympathy for the subpar MCs who fell victim to the ""Wrath of Kane.""

The smooth operator, Big Daddy Kane, still emits that same palpable swag he did as a lyrical heartthrob during his heyday. He strides into the room and fully commands it with his presence. And now that hip-hop is the most popular genre, with its biggest stars wielding global influence, it's important to us here at Tiny Desk to continue to make room for the legends who laid the foundation before the whole world became hip. Long live the Kane.

W8SnRPbiGH8,Betsayda Machado y Parranda El Clavo: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Feb. 16, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- Watching Betsayda Machado y Parranda El Clavo perform their Tiny Desk concert is like peering back in time. The music's roots extend to the Venezuelan slave trade, and while the vocals are in Spanish and not an African dialect, the instruments the group plays date back more than 500 years.

The large bamboo cylinders, the djembe-like drums and the large friction drum together create a symphony of interlocking polyrhythms that was unlike anything I'd heard. Machado's vocals soar over the unrelenting rhythms, and when she harmonizes with the other singers, it creates a choir-like display of African call-and-response vocals.

When discussing African-influenced music from the southern hemisphere, we often focus on countries like Brazil and Cuba, places where the folk music eventually made its way into popular music. Afro-Venezuelan culture and music is rarely featured or even acknowledged outside of the country. As you'll see in this video, that should change once music fans take in the beauty of Machado's voice and the power of her historical message.

N83D8KUeCqs,Nick Hakim: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Feb. 14, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- The music of Nick Hakim occupies a space and time that is faintly out of this world. The guitars and machinery that make up his music feel slightly askew, as though someone slowed down the tape machine every once in a while. His raspy voice feels drenched in a cavernous space. In fact, the first time I met Nick Hakim, he was literally draped in fiber optics, as if stars were surrounding him. That was in Austin at SXSW's Optic Obscura installation.

But here at the Tiny Desk, in Nick Hakim's hometown of Washington D.C., it was daylight at our office and all pretty down-to-earth, with guitars, bass, drums, piano and a touch of electronics behind my desk. Yet, with his voice unamplified and stripped of the reverb he's come to rely on, Nick Hakim's music still felt warm and spacious.

The songs he performed are from his 2017 record, Green Twins. The tune he opens with is an exploration of memory, of sex and love as he sings, ""It's been years since you came around to these parts of my mind / All I can recall is you restin' naked every time.""

Exploring the quietude of inner thoughts seems to be a theme floating through Nick Hakim's music. And in the broad daylight of this Tiny Desk, his talent for lyricism and tamed passion, along with his band's playful restraint, reshaped these songs in ways that feel more accessible and less obtuse. So here's your chance to discover someone who may be new to you, with the hope you'll explore Nick Hakim's recorded work.

Ab8YnmHB6tE,Marlon Williams: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Feb. 12, 2018 | Bob Boilen --Marlon Williams is a handsome devil with a heart-stopping voice, who writes songs about vampires and horror films. This 27-year old, New Zealand-born, Melbourne-based singer is also a teller of tales.

Marlon Williams is in love with a good, traditional blues or country tune and that's just how he opens this Tiny Desk Concert, with a song called ""When I Was A Young Girl"" (also known traditionally as ""One Morning In May"" or ""The Bad Girl's Lament""). The best-known version of it was probably by Nina Simone until Feist tackled the tune. But Marlon Williams' rendition is more stunning than any version I've heard and seems to conjure the spirit of Roy Orbison with its long, deep-throated incantations. The purity of Marlon Williams' voice is rare and entrancing.

After that first tune, performed solo with just his acoustic guitar, he strapped on his electric guitar, brought out his band, snapped his fingers to set the beat and sang about being stoned and running around Los Angeles dressed as a vampire. At the time of our taping, back in October of last year, ""Vampire Again"" was the newest song since Marlon Williams' 2016, self-titled release.

After finishing that tune and losing his guitar pick, he found one left behind by Wilco and launched into a tune we'd not heard before. He calls ""What's Chasing You"" a song about horror films, but it sounds like a 1950s tune about unrequited love.

The brilliant session ends as the band gathered around a single microphone for another new tune called ""Make Way For Love."" We now know it's the title track to Marlon Williams' forthcoming album and it reveals an intimacy at the heart of what makes him such a magnetic artist.

Set List

""When I Was a Young Girl""
""Vampire Again""

5KmvqS56jSU,The Crossrhodes: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Feb. 9, 2018 | Bobby Carter -- Witnessing The Crossrhodes perform at the Tiny Desk instantly snapped me back to their early beginnings, just a few miles away from NPR headquarters. In 2001, on any given Monday night on U Street, music lovers would be treated to a magic show. Bar Nun's open mic night unearthed some of the finest MC's, poets and singers from the area, but they all took a back seat once the Crossrhodes stepped on stage. Week after week, the band passionately performed original material that jumped between society's woes and their own love lives, going from mere contestants to the main attraction. Word eventually spread outside of the D.C. area and one-half of the group, Raheem DeVaughn, landed a record deal.

DeVaughn went on to achieve R&B superstardom, earning two Grammy nominations, while the other half of the group, Wes Felton, has remained a pillar of D.C. culture, excelling as both a musician and actor. They reunited and released their first album in over a decade last year. Footprints on the Moon recapitulates and magnifies the ideals they conveyed in the early 2000s with a hyper-focused sense of urgency. There's nothing subliminal about the way they go about; there's no need to guess what side they're on. Representing the misrepresented, their approach is clear and direct.

Draped in black suits, they entered the building with their game faces on. Poet, Raquel Ra Brown eloquently set the tone for the band to completely ravish the desk. The Crossrhodes ripped through 3 and half selections from ""FOTM"" including an emotional rendition of ""Praying Prayers.""

DeVaughn, notorious for leaving his soul on stages around the world, belts with every ounce of his being while Felton came equipped with a completely reinvigorated flow, delivering bars of the most potent lyrics of his career.

Dear Father, I come to you at moment

As a humble soldier, eye to eye with my opponents

Half don't know or acknowledge your components

They don't read your word, even if they own it

The crowd's subtle intrigue slowly swelled into sheer fandom by the last note, reminiscent of those Bar Nun days. As we continue to celebrate Black History Month, I can't think of a more fitting band that exemplifies the strife, perseverance and exuberance of Black music.

SET LIST

""Footprints on the Moon""
""How You Gon' Fall""

GeApLkyH8jg,Ibeyi: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Feb. 7, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- The twin sisters in Ibeyi started their turn behind the Tiny Desk by singing an invocation of a West African Yoruba deity.

They come by their connection to the Afro-Cuban culture by way of their late father, Miguel ""Anga"" Diaz, an in-demand Cuban percussionist who was part of a vanguard musicians who reinvigorated Cuban music before he died prematurely at age 45 in 2006. The sisters, Lisa-Kaindé and Naomi Díaz, carry that calling in their DNA, and how they've manifested it into their own art is nothing short of amazing.

As you see in this video, the twins (Ibeyi means 'twins"" in Yoruban) perform their music with the batá drums associated with Yoruban sacred music and their elaborate vocal arrangements channel the call-and-response of traditional African music. The melding of their voices when they harmonize can be breathtaking, but the same can be said about the messages behind their songs, themes that inspire both inward introspection and celebrations of life.

The sisters truly have a magic that transcends cultures and languages. I watched them lead a sold-out crowd at Washington D.C.'s 9:30 Club through a Yoruban chant, and it was mind-blowing. Imagine that magical intensity in the small confines of NPR Music's offices and you get an idea of how transfixed we were.

And now you can experience that yourself. Enjoy.

T7di55eTFDE,Hurray For the Riff Raff: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Feb. 5, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- Alynda Segarra's unamplifed voice in this Tiny Desk performance had no problem rising above the drums, congas, cello, violin, bass, keyboards, and an electric guitar. The passion for her Puerto Rican roots feels boundless. As Soul Captain for Hurray for the Riff Raff, she and her band weave tales of man's inhumanity to fellow humans, often from bigotry, intolerance and ignorance.

But the spirit that arises out of her ancestral roots and its clash with twenty-first century cultural insensitivities inspires the brilliance that is Hurray For The Riff Raff's latest album, The Navigator. This 2017 release and the songs that grace it are at the heart of the fervency Alynda Segarra sings about so animatedly at the Tiny Desk. The song ""Pa'lante,"" one of the most articulate songs of a generation, speaks of being colonized and hypnotized, sterilized and dehumanized, with the refrain, ""pa'lante"" which translates as ""forward."" I think of it as ""onward."" To continue the fight to freedom and respect. As Alynda Segarra preaches:

""To all who lost their pride, I say, Pa'lante!
To all who had to survive, I say, Pa'lante!
To my brothers, and my sisters, I say, Pa'lante!""

Writing songs with a message can often turn out to be well-meaning, but musically less memorable. These songs, however, play as anthems and help do what music can do best – build bridges, unite people and form communities. Hurray for the Riff Raff, indeed!

haK0DUXIre0,Vicente García: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Feb. 2, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- Singer-songwriter Vicente García is still relatively under the radar, but performances like the one he gave at the Tiny Desk are starting to turn some heads.

García's music isn't dominated by his native Dominican Republic, but you can hear it in every note. His poetic lyrics are like short stories, sung by a voice both plaintive and evocative, yet always distinct.

-ZOW4CvYAZ4,Alice Smith: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Jan. 31, 2018 | Abby O'Neill -- Alice Smith is umami for the ears. From the opening licks of her Tiny Desk set, the eclectic singer-songwriter turned NPR's spacious D.C. headquarters into a Harlem speakeasy.

For those not familiar, Smith made a big splash among true-school heads in 2006 with the release of her debut album, For Lovers, Dreamers, and Friends. That record, whose title is a play on ""The Rainbow Connection,"" brimmed with an arcane magic, and it created a legion of lifelong fans.

Smith's live performances usually highlight songs from For Lovers, Dreamers, and Friends, her 2013 album, She, and her repertoire of cover songs. But for her Tiny Desk performance, Smith gifted us with three stunning song premieres that left the room entirely in her thrall.

The first song, ""Mystery,"" feels like walking into the home of that friend of yours who is clearly more worldly than you, where there's always a cool breeze, no matter the season.

The second song, which is so new that it doesn't have a title, exudes the liminal uneasiness of being out of tune with yourself. The wisdom of the song draws from the notion that the top of Maslow's pyramid is found within.

The closing ""Something"" is an undulating soul search that attacks and recedes like a cloudy beach morning. Smith was unabashedly in her pocket here, alternating between falsetto, tremolo and touches of jazz. This dash of Broadway at an office cubicle is what makes the Tiny Desk series so special.

""Something""

NbpRu-yzNfs,Jamila Woods: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Jan. 29, 2018 | Suraya Mohamed -- Singer, songwriter, poet, educator and community organizer Jamila Woods is also a freedom fighter: a voice that celebrates black ancestry, black feminism and black identity. ""Look at what they did to my sisters last century, last week,"" goes a line from ""Blk Girl Soldier,"" her powerful opening number at the Tiny Desk.

""Traumatic things ... happen to black people, but then you still have to go to work the next day, or you still have to wake up and teach a class, or go take care of your family,"" Woods told NPR in September. ""I had just been bottling up all my feelings about these things ... so I remember this song being a way for me to cry about a lot of those things and just feel them and sit with them.""

Woods followed ""Blk Girl Soldier"" with ""Giovanni,"" another anthem of black female pride, inspired by the Nikki Giovanni poem ""Ego Tripping."" The original text includes no punctuation, not a single comma or period, and reveals a liberated prosody that is also illustrated in the song. Listen how her lyricism interplays with the rhythm section's syncopated groove to create a captivating state of emotional buoyancy.

There is much to savor in Woods' music, rich with philosophical meaning and striking musicality. Of particular note is her recurring theme of self-love, as heard in ""Holy,"" the last song in this set: ""Woke up this morning with my mind set on loving me."" (What a refreshing affirmation to hear ""loving me,"" instead of the predictable ""loving you."")

""My mission as an artist is always to create art that's useful,"" Woods told NPR. ""I want my music to feel like it has a tangible effect on people, like it allows them to check in with themselves, feel affirmed, feel able to continue into their day or into their path with renewed energy and a renewed sense of self, because ... that's what I hope to manifest in myself.""

jKkb2q9EbSg,Barbara Hannigan: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Jan. 26, 2018 | Tom Huizenga -- In these days of wireless earbuds, streams and podcasts, the notion of people gathering to hear a lone classical singer (with a pianist) perform densely structured art songs in a foreign tongue seems almost laughably quaint.

Yet the vocal recital, as a performance genre, is still alive. And one of the most memorable recitals I've witnessed in a long time sits on this page, in a condensed form, thanks to the extraordinary soprano Barbara Hannigan and her accompanist Reinbert de Leeuw.

The night before this Tiny Desk concert, the two musicians gave a beautiful and intense recital at Washington's Kennedy Center. The songs, all in German, came from a heady period in Vienna, when music was transitioning from the swells of romanticism to the uncharted waters of modernism. Four of those songs make up this Tiny Desk performance. The bonus here is that these impassioned dispatches become even more intimate.

Consider the opening song, Alexander Zemlinsky's ""Empfängnis"" (Conception). The harmonies are sweet, but almost too rich, like overripe fruit, when Hannigan sings lines like, ""Und wie ich sehend meine Arme breite"" (And as I open my arms with longing). You can hear the end of a musical era.

An indefatigable champion of new and modern music, Hannigan (who is also a conductor) has given the world premieres of more than 80 pieces. The voice is simply gorgeous — silvery, buttery-smooth throughout the registers, with crystalline top notes emerging from thin air and charged with emotion.

In Alma Mahler's ""Licht in der Nacht"" (Light in the Night), Hannigan taps into the mysterious sparkle of a little yellow star twinkling through black skies as de Leeuw's piano explores wayward harmonies. Hugo Wolf's ""Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt"" (Only One Who Knows Longing) is a hymn to the yearning heart. De Leeuw explains that the key of G minor, in which the song is written, never materializes. It's all about the longing for G minor.

The final song, ""Schenk mir deinen goldenen Kamm"" (the first music by Arnold Schoenberg to grace the Tiny Desk), offers a double dose of sensuality. Hannigan's beautiful middle register and creamy phrasing paint the scene: Jesus asks Mary Magdalene for her comb because it will remind him every morning that she once kissed his hair. Hannigan calls the song ""erotic"" and she delivers on that feeling when, at the end, she cries out the name ""Magdalena"" with a lustrous, silken tone, touched with anguish.

Hannigan told the audience that her Kennedy Center recital felt like ""a sacred moment of people coming together in very deep concentration."" At this Tiny Desk recital, it happened all over again.

SET LIST

Alexander Zemlinsky: ""Empfängnis""
Alma Mahler: ""Licht in der Nacht""

IxAcW7zgAD4,George Clinton & The P-Funk All Stars: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Jan. 24, 2018 | Abby O'Neill -- The rhythm of family has been a constant thread throughout P-Funk's long lineage and the myriad iterations the band has undergone in its 50-plus years. From The Parliaments to Funkadelic to Parliament Funkadelic to the P-Funk All Stars, George Clinton has conducted the mothership as a reliable father figure. When he commands you to ""put a glide in your stride and a dip in your hip, and come on up to the Mothership,"" he's presenting to you the first law of Funktonian physics. We at NPR pledged our groovellegiance when he and his P-Funk All Stars touched down to bless the Tiny Desk.

Clinton has brought his own bloodline into the most recent lineup of P-Funk: His grandchildren are the newest backup singers, while another grandchild serves as tour manager. Though this was a much smaller outfit than their traditional stage shows — no horn section, no dancers, no Sir Nose D'Voidoffunk — the extended family was also in full effect. Garrett Shider on rhythm guitar, filling in for his late father, Garry Shider, aka Starchild. Even original trumpeter Bennie Cowan, who still tours with the group but didn't make it to the Tiny Desk, typically plays alongside his son Benzel on drums. Blackbyrd McKnight and Lige Curry cement the foundation as elder statesmen who've been rocking with Clinton since 1978.

Indeed, the funk father refuses to let the musicianship slip — the band was as sonically tight as ever, blessing us with a canonical three-song set list of classic jams. P-Funk's influence shaped '90s hip-hop and culture immeasurably; without Clinton, we'd have no NWA, no G-funk, no Tupac, no EPMD, no Ice Cube... and, of course, no one's forgotten about Dre. Clinton and P-Funk brought world class funksmanship, and it was our pleasure to air the room out and squeegee the floors after soaking up their cosmic slop.

Set List

""Standing On The Verge Of Getting It On""

""One Nation Under A Groove""

""Give up the Funk (Tear the Roof off the Sucker)""

BfYJt1O8ZjY,St. Vincent: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Jan. 22, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- Whenever I imagined a St. Vincent Tiny Desk Concert, it was always going to be loud and electric. But I didn't see this coming – the brilliant guitarist arrived at NPR with one steel string acoustic guitar and without a warm-up or soundcheck. Annie Clark stood at my desk, in front of a few hundred-plus NPR employees and close friends, and hit us hard with her un-amplified voice, unplugged guitar, her checkered wardrobe and most importantly, her songs.

These three tunes, ""New York,"" ""Los Ageless"" (not Los Angeles), and ""Slow Disco"" are all from her recent record MASSEDUCTION (not Masseducation). It's not the guitar-heavy record we're used to hearing from St. Vincent. In fact, album producer Jack Antonoff (of the bands Bleachers and Fun.) thought ""New York"" was a better piano melody than a guitar tune, so Annie had Thomas Bartlett (aka Doveman) perform it.

Stripped of texture and flash, the wordplay pops in these songs. The cross references between the first two bi-coastal songs are clearer. Her love of New York and her mere liking of Los Angeles and its obsession with youth and appearance are more apparent in these spare arrangements.

There's a bravery here, too, that should not go unnoticed. Behind the sunglasses and red beret is an artist who usually presents herself as part of a choreographed production. St. Vincent's current one-person shows are powered by backing tracks, lighting and lots of stage cues. It's the sort of performance that feels more about execution in my mind. This stripped-down set is more about emotion, more about a one-on-one connection, and that's the bravery. To come out from the lights and the effects, leaving the laptop sync behind, pulled me into these songs in ways both the album and her live show hadn't. I'm not faulting the record or the concert, I just found something in these songs, in this setting that had glazed past me before. I'm curious if that will happen to you.

""New York""
""Los Ageless""
""Slow Disco""

hcAKsXR51HQ,Amadou and Mariam: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Jan. 19, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- The title and subject of Amadou & Mariam's latest album, La Confusion, would lead you to believe that the music this married, Malian couple make might be sad and troubled. But Amadou & Mariam, on the contrary, bring some of the most lyrical melodies and joyful sounds we've ever had at the Tiny Desk, and their performance comes while their country endures great turmoil, including a coup and insurgencies.

As Amadou and Mariam said when their album was released, ""We seek to make people happy with our music, help humanitarian causes and share positive messages about the good work being done by people in every corner of the world.""

The story of Amadou and Mariam is still worth telling almost 40-years (and eight albums) into their career because it speaks well to who they are, the obstacles they've had to overcome and the positive yet realistic attitude that has made them such an international success. Amadou Bagayoko and Mariam Doumbia met when they were children in Mali's Institute for the Young Blind. Both had lost their sight when they were young and they began performing together. Later, in the 1980s, they married and began a career together.

On this occasion, they stripped down their bigger band to a keyboard, a percussionist and a backup singer while the couple holds it all together with Amadou's stuttered melodic guitar and Mariam's sweetly gruff voice. It's an inspired performance to hear and to witness.

AzDZywUp-mQ,The Lemon Twigs: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Jan. 17, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- It's as if brothers Brian and Michael D'Addario fell from the sky, victims of a transporter beam gone awry in 1971, and landed here at my desk with guitars in hand, right next to a perfectly tuned Yamaha upright piano. When they dusted themselves off, Brian (20) and Michael (18) channeled their deep admiration for The Beatles with their own original tunes as The Lemon Twigs, playing songs from their recent EP Brothers Of Destruction, a natural extension to their debut album Do Hollywood, filled with Paul McCartney-pop leanings.

At this Tiny Desk Concert, the layers of sound found in The Lemon Twigs' recordings are stripped away, which makes the lyrics more noticeable, words that at times feel destined for a Broadway stage.

It was almost eerie seeing two young adults at my desk who look an awful lot like I and many of my friends did back around 1970. It's uncanny, almost as if Brian and Michael have been somehow shielded from the 21st century. But the truth is they look and sound like they do because they live in a world where everything is at their fingertips, where they can dive deep and explore and create a niche.

It's fair to say that the strength of The Lemon Twigs is in the songwriting and the way they layer their recordings with their multi-instrumental talents. I love what they do, not as nostalgia but for its explorations of melody, harmony and lyrics that are memorable. Even stripped down, they are a whole lot of fun.

gUd7z9g8vGY,AHI: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Jan. 16, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- The first time I heard the music of AHI (pronounced ""eye"") was in the midst of listening to 120 other song submissions for the DIY Musicians Conference panel I was hosting in Nashville back in August. It simply rose above everything else I heard.

AHI's gruff but sweet voice and openly honest words were my gateway to this young Ontario-based singer. Later that summer night in Nashville, I saw him perform an uplifting set of original, soulful tunes, ending with a cover of Sam Cooke's ""A Change Is Gonna Come,"" a song AHI says he sings at the end of every set with a sense of hope. It was powerfully moving, without a note that felt clichéd or overly nostalgic. At that moment, I knew he needed to play a Tiny Desk Concert.

AHI's performance here at my desk didn't disappoint. In fact, it won over a roomful of NPR employees and some friends who came by to take a chance on a new discovery. With a tasteful band comprised of Frank Carter Rische on electric guitar, Robbie Crowell on bass guitar and Shawn Killaly (a man of a million faces) on drums, AHI put his heart into three songs in just about 11 minutes, all from his debut album We Made It Through The Wreckage, which came out a year ago this week.

AHI ended on the song that first attracted my attention this past summer in Nashville, the song ""Ol' Sweet Day."" With an uplifting beat and warm sentiment, it simply feels undeniable and universal in its expression of love.

""I've got a lot to learn
You've got a lot to give
We can go anywhere
Rebuild this broken bridge
You've got a heart of gold
I've got a mind that goes
On and on and on to places we'll never know,

When the darkness comes
When the ol' sweet day is done""

-T6b-obgmlc,"The Artists From The ""Take Me to the River"" Tour: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","Jan. 15, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- 
""Take Me To The River"" is a 1974 song from the legendary Al Green and guitarist ""Teenie"" Hodges. And though it wasn't a big hit at the time, this song's mix of religion and desire has become part of pop music's canon with versions done most famously by Talking Heads, Bryan Ferry, Foghat and Levon Helm.

Here at the Tiny Desk, some of the original players of this deep southern soul have come together to honor and update this tradition. It's a celebration of Memphis soul old and new, with 13 musicians wedged behind the desk.

Some of those players of the old include singers Bobby Rush and William Bell; on the Hammond organ, Rev. Charles Hodges and LeRoy Hodges on bass. But it's what's new that makes this more than a look back – the addition of southern rappers Frayser Boy and Al Kapone – that truly puts this project on new musical ground.

Variations of this group and subsequent tours got a jump start with a 2014 documentary film called Take Me To The River, directed by Martin Shore, which focused on the legacy of southern soul. In fact, you'll see Martin in the background playing percussion here at the Tiny Desk! It's a joyful, triumphant gathering not to be missed. The band heads back on tour January 23.

W23gEiUwne0,Daniil Trifonov: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Jan. 12, 2018 | Tom Huizenga -- When we invited Russian pianist Daniil Trifonov to play a Tiny Desk concert, we rolled out the big guns. In place of the trusty upright, we wedged a 7-foot grand piano behind Bob Boilen's desk in preparation for the artist who The Times of London called ""without question the most astounding pianist of our age.""

That's a pretty lofty claim, but watch and judge for yourself. His performance here is extraordinary. Still in his 20s, Trifonov seems to have it all: jaw-dropping technique and interpretive skills beyond his age. He's also a composer — the night before his NPR visit, he played his own knuckle-twisting piano concerto at the Kennedy Center here in Washington, D.C.

But for his Tiny Desk show, Trifonov focused on Chopin, beginning with the mercurial ""Fantaisie-Impromptu"" in C-sharp minor, a work that mixes sweeping melody, turbulent passion and wistful repose. Hunching close over the keyboard with feline agility, Trifonov's slender fingers glide effortlessly. He coaxes the instrument to sing tenderly in the slow central section.

Trifonov follows with a pair of short tributes to Chopin by his peers. Robert Schumann's ""Chopin"" accentuates the lyrical side of Chopin, filtered through the German composer's forward-looking harmonies, while Edvard Grieg's ""Hommage à Chopin"" offers volatility, lovingly rendered.

The smartly programmed set is capped with more Chopin, but with a nod to Mozart: the finale from a set of variations based on an aria from Don Giovanni. It gives Trifonov a chance to display his lightness of touch, plus a few pianistic fireworks. Smiling, he treats the tricky filigreed runs and hand crossings as if it were a child's game. Look closely and you can see the piano shake.

(Daniil Trifonov appears courtesy of Deutsche Grammophon GmbH.)

Set List*

Chopin: ""Fantaisie-Impromptu, Op. 66""

Schumann: ""Chopin. Agitato"" (from Carnaval)

XZdnq5tN5vI,Julien Baker: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Jan. 10, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- In March of 2016, just a handful of months after her debut album Sprained Ankle was released, Julien Baker came and played a quiet, thoughtful Tiny Desk concert that went on to become one of our most popular and certainly one of the most-talked-about Tiny Desk Concerts of the year. (It's now approaching two million views on YouTube alone.)

Fast forward to the summer of 2017, when I heard that a new record was imminent. I don't usually ask an artist back for a second Tiny Desk Concert simply because they have a new release — but for Julien, I had to make an exception. With all the love that surrounded her first visit to the NPR offices, I reached out to ask if she would be willing to do something different this time around. Last fall, she delivered.

All the songs for her return to the Tiny Desk come from last year's Turn Out The Lights. Just a few weeks before the album's release, she came to Washington; we tuned our piano, she brought violinist Camille Faulkner. The first two songs, ""Hurt Less"" and ""Even,"" were accompanied by Camille, with Julien on piano for the opening tune and acoustic guitar on the second. It's quite stunning, as she sings:

Putting my fist through the plaster in the bathroom of a Motel 6

I must have pictured it all a thousand times

I swear to God I think I'm gonna die

I know you were right

I can't be fixed, so help me

For the last, Julien put together an arrangement of ""Appointments"" that begins on electric guitar, which then was looped as a backdrop to her on piano and voice.

Julien Baker is a massively talented songwriter with a deeply caring heart and a perfectionist streak — all of which delivered to her a career-making year. We are so thrilled to have her return.

6uXG6bReqXY,The Weather Station: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Jan. 8, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- The Weather Station's fourth (and self-titled) album was a constant companion for me in 2017, in no small part for the song that opens the band's Tiny Desk performance. It's called ""Thirty"" and in less than four minutes and nearly 400 words, singer Tamara Lindeman paints images of joy intertwined with the awaking jolt of turning thirty.

The dollar was down
But my friends opened businesses
There were new children
And again, I didn't get married
I wasn't close to my family
And my dad was raising a child in Nairobi
She was three now, he told me

The musicians in The Weather Station underpin these words with delicate playing and by sitting quietly but poigntantly under Tamara Lindeman's beautiful voice. Her soft voice shifts pitch with a rapid flow in a Joni Mitchell-sort of way, never coming up in volume more than a quiet, table conversation level.

On ""Free,"" a song Tamara Lindeman describes as about being both free and not free at the same time, there's restraint in the voice and a release in the powerful guitar chords. That tension and release is an essential element to The Weather Station's sound and one of the joys I've found listening to their enchanting music.

""Thirty""

""You and I (On the Other Side of the World)""

""Free""

BVnUddPsVRk,Lo Moon: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Dec. 5, 2018 | Suraya Mohamed -- They drove into the NPR garage crammed into an extended cargo van, 9 feet tall, instruments and luggage crammed all the way to the ceiling. They didn't use all of that gear, but even on this mainly acoustic, stripped-down set, Lo Moon radiated a signature sound — intimate and demonstrative, haunting yet uplifting, an old-fashioned rock beat under glimmering guitar and keys, overlaid with beautiful, textured vocals.

Lead singer and instrumentalist Matt Lowell says this journey began 5 1/2 years ago with ""Loveless,"" the last song in this set. He created the demo version in a basement studio in New York, moved to Los Angeles and then linked up with Crisanta Baker (guitar, bass, keyboards and backing vocals) and multi-instrumentalist and principal guitarist Sam Stewart. They spent months in a backyard shed with gear and guitars everywhere. There they learned to feed off each other, sometimes jamming on two-chord drones for six hours straight without even saying a word. With the lights turned down, it was a comfortable space for the band to catch its artistic wind and create a celestial sound.

Here too at the Tiny Desk, Lo Moon is at ease, mesmerizing the audience with hooks loaded with what they call ""bunches of atmospheres"" and a gorgeous blend of soothing harmonies, pulsing rhythms and soaring melodies.

it3DnfTZIM0,Open Mike Eagle: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Jan. 3, 2018 | Rodney Carmichael -- Open Mike Eagle may have released one of the most political albums of 2017, but Brick Body Kids Still Daydream is also among the most personal. It comes across best in his live performances. For only the second time during his recent tour cycle, the LA-based artist played a set aided by the live instrumentation of musicians Jordan Katz (trumpet, keys, sampler), Josh Lopez (keys, sampler) and Brandon Owens (bass) for his Tiny Desk debut.

""Smells like lots of good soup in here,"" he said to the audience one-third of the way through his set. The arctic temps hadn't quite set in when he came to NPR's Washington, D.C. headquarters in December, but Open Mike still exuded plenty of warmth while performing two songs from the stellar LP he released last September.

The album made multiple NPR Music best-of-2017 lists and earned him widespread critical acclaim for its inspired look at the inhumane demolition of public housing across America. The way we talk about displacement today, you'd think it was a new phenomenon; unfortunately, our language tends to evolve faster than we do. It's been a decade since the last brick fell from the Robert Taylor Homes, the old Chicago Housing Authority project personified on the record. Yet, when it comes to excavating the politics of place, and all the racial implications inherent in cultural erasure, there is no project released in recent years that comes close.

The sound of a trumpet breathes an ominous air into his opener, ""(How Could Anybody) Feel at Home."" But it's the underlying sense of imagination, as he sings on the hook about superpowers and secrets impossible to un-see, that gives it lift. By the time he closes out the set with ""Very Much Money,"" from his 2014 album Dark Comedy, it's apparent that Mike Eagle has come to represent those scraping to survive winter in America.

XMafp_ykmVk,This Is The Kit: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Dec. 19, 2017 | Bob Boilen -- Effortless storytelling is at the heart of This Is The Kit. And the stories the band's only permanent member, Kate Stables, weaves are profound but sweet with a tone that quietly reels you in.

""Bullet Proof"" is the opening song at the Tiny Desk – and the opening track on her fourth album, Moonshine Freeze – a song that sees the darkest challenges in life as a way to begin again. ""Everything we broke today/Needing breaking, anyway,"" Kate Stables sings as she's picking on her banjo with tides of percussion and bass flowing in. It takes two minutes before the perfectly punctuated guitar hits but completely worth the wait.

That gradual unfolding is the strength of these songs and this band. ""Moonshine Freeze,"" the last one they perform at the Tiny Desk, is the title track to the new album produced by John Parish. It's a song taken from a children's clapping game: Say ""moonshine"" three times, then freeze. But the song takes these images deeper, looking at patterns in the repetitive words, specifically patterns of three, which in Kate's mind forms a triangle or a delta and it just gets deeper.

Lovers of Sufjan Stevens will appreciate the gentle ways Kate Stables can touch a heart with a song. And the band she plays with here is tightly in touch with how best to support these tunes.

Set List
""Bullet Proof""
""Hotter Colder""
""Moonshine Freeze""

i0F-z13-vHQ,Hanson: NPR Music Holiday Tiny Desk Concert,"Dec. 18, 2017 | Stephen Thompson -- We've been recording Tiny Desk concerts for nearly a decade, and in that time, a few artists have come back for encores — folks like Wilco, Chris Thile and the inspiration for the series, Laura Gibson. One band, The Oh Hellos, came back after a year to favor us with a holiday set. But we've never, until now, asked anyone to return later the same day.

Back in September, we brought in Hanson to play a set of old and new songs, in honor of a new career anthology called Middle of Everywhere. But, since Hanson has also just released a holiday album called Finally It's Christmas, Bob Boilen — our own right-jolly old elf — sprung on everyone the idea of taking an hour off between sets and bringing Ike, Taylor and Zac Hanson back for a wintery encore. Which means, as you'll see here, everything from frantic time-lapse set decoration to an intrusive snow machine.

As for the music itself, the Hanson brothers kicked off their second set of the day with a pair of rollicking originals before standing around a single mic for an a cappella mashup of ""Joy To The World"" and ""Go Tell It On The Mountain."" All three songs are from Finally It's Christmas, which Hanson released to roughly coincide with the 20th anniversary of its million-selling holiday favorite Snowed In. So sit back, pour yourself a cup of hot cocoa — or, if you prefer, boozy egg nog — and soak up a raucous and reverent Christmas party.

From everyone at the Tiny Desk, we hope you enjoy your holidays as much as our standing-room-only crowd enjoyed watching Zac and Taylor Hanson borrow a pair of the ugliest Christmas sweaters imaginable. (Yes, Virginia, that is a vomiting unicorn.)

HcAxgErAkTw,Cigarettes After Sex: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Dec. 13, 2017 | Bob Boilen -- This comes close to the quietest Tiny Desk Concert we've ever had. The music Greg Gonzalez makes with his longtime bandmate Phillip Tubbs as Cigarettes After Sex is hushed. The common thread in these songs is minimalism, heard in both Greg's guitar and Philip's synth, that lay just under Greg Gonzalez's barely audible, somewhat spoken singing. Yet, somehow, this sound that barely exists holds together because of the strong melodies in these songs. I find I sing them to myself over and over again.

""K.,"" the opening track to this Tiny Desk Concert – and the opening cut to the band's eight year-long awaited debut album – is especially memorable. The lyrics are simple and easy to remember: ""Kristen, come right back/I've been waiting for you to slip back in bed/When you light the candle.""

In addition to minimal music, the words to these songs are stripped to their essence and it's that directness and lack of mystery I find attractive. It makes each note and each word seem to count for more than they might otherwise. And despite the light of day and the office environment of the Tiny Desk Concert, the smoky bedroom laden songs work, maybe even, in some ways, better than in a club, where just the chatter of a crowd can drown out this gentle music.

So, dim the lights, maybe light a candle and bliss out.

JQs5XagfheI,Courtney Barnett and Kurt Vile: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Dec. 8, 2017 | Bob Boilen -- Put your love of perfection outside the office door and come in for some office fun. This collaboration between Philadelphia's Kurt Vile and Melbourne's Courtney Barnett is more about newfound friends poking jabs, goofing around and having fun with words than reaching any new musical heights. It's a much welcome injection of humor in the world of rock music and if you've heard their collaborative album Lotta Sea Lice, you'll find this Tiny Desk performance musically even more casual. It's akin to hearing friends play after a few afternoon beers, which is kind of what happened. (We actually had to page folks in the building hoping for some brew and were quite surprised at what the NPR staff had stashed in the fridge.)

The two singers/songwriters/guitarists have been mutual admirers and kept bumping into one another at various festivals. They find mutual love for twang and so their songs lean country, though their respective countries are hemispheres apart.

Kurt and Courtney tend to bring out the adolescence in one another, inspiring Kurt to pick out a song he wrote when he was roughly fourteen called ""Blue Cheese"" about, well, I'm not sure. But lines like, ""I didn't mean to cough on her/Forgot to add the fabric softener,"" just make me laugh; and in 2017, in a deeply serious political landscape, I find that quite refreshing.

Set List

""Over Everything""

""Continental Breakfast""

Dec. 11, 2017 | Sidney Madden -- Tyler, The Creator's Tiny Desk performance was a first for many reasons. It was the Los Angeles rapper's first time performing at our offices, but moreover, it was the Tiny Desk's first nighttime performance, a special request from Tyler and his team in order to professionally light the ""stage"" themselves. Members of Tyler's lighting crew came to the office a day before to set it up, eventually bathing him and his band in shades of fuchsia, orange and blue — one for each song — during the early evening show.

Flower Boy, Tyler's latest album, is much like this Tiny Desk performance; a surprising departure from the expected. Four albums in, he has matured as a producer, rapper and human being. Often equated to hip-hop's class clown, the 26-year-old peels back his own mask of immaturity to reveal a young adult grappling with anxiety, fear and uncertainty of self.

After he was done, Tyler did something of a modified mic-drop, throwing his tambourine in celebration of what he and his band had accomplished. Always one to stay casually connected with his fans, Tyler made time — nearly an hour after the performance was done —- to pose for photos, sign merch and crack jokes with (and on) everyone around him.

LL_iUj-mQfg,King Krule: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Dec. 6, 2017 | Bob Boilen -- The Ooz, the title to King Krule's latest album, is the perfect name for his music. It conjures, in my mind, a word mashup of ""cool"" and ""jazz."" The music is eerily evocative with lyrics that talk about the sorts of depression singer and guitarist Archy Marshall has dealt with in his young life. And, at 23, he has a lot to say on the subject. His opening song at the Tiny Desk, ""Midnight 01 (Deep Sea Diver),"" includes the line, ""Why'd you leave me? Because of my depression? / You used to complete me but I guess I learnt a lesson."" The song continues with water-sinking metaphors and how he deals with the pressure. All this comes from someone who honestly looks like he couldn't care less, which seems like a far cry from the words and care he puts into his twisted, woozy tones.

Those tones are played here by five other musicians, including sax, guitars, bass, drums, live vocal processing of Archy's voice and electronics. It's a winning path down a musical road rarely traveled – and an acquired taste well worth dipping in.

BbP1AzDf7T0,Ted Leo: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Dec. 4, 2017 | Daoud Tyler-Ameen -- The Ted Leo who showed up to perform at our office this fall was no stranger to NPR Music; in fact, he'd stood on that very spot a few years earlier, trading verses with Aimee Mann in their collaborative project The Both. But he did seem like a changed man.

In the seven years since his last solo album, Leo had been steadily reevaluating his relationship with performance, the business of music and even his own voice. Over the applause that followed his opening number, the bone-rattling slow burn ""Moon Out of Phase,"" he smiled and explained the song was perhaps ""a little heavy for noon — but, practically speaking, it helps me get the cobwebs out.""

How you listen to Leo depends on when his work came into your life. If you're a back-in-the-day type you might rep for Chisel, his '90s punk outfit born on the Notre Dame campus and bred in Washington, D.C. If you're just tuning in, you may have witnessed his understated comedy chops in arenas like The Best Show on WFMU and a highly enjoyable Twitter feed. At the center of this bell curve are those who found Leo at the dawn of the 2000s — when, at the helm of what's most commonly called Ted Leo and the Pharmacists (shout-out to the typographical variants still mucking up iTunes libraries), he kicked off a run of five stellar albums in just under 10 years, each one urgently attuned to its political context and yet defiant in its ideas of what punk could sound like and whose stories it could aim to tell. Fans will tell you the songs about eating disorders and missing old ska bands felt just as vital to their moment as those that explicitly took on Sept. 11 and the Iraq War.

Leo's latest, The Hanged Man, is different: Recorded at home in fits and starts, with Leo playing most of the instruments himself, the album comprises years of reflection, his gaze fixed more often on his own life than on the headlines. But what was evident in his performance here, which included two new songs and one gem from his classic period, was an enduring knack for turning internal anxiety into kinetic energy, no matter the subject. By the time he hit the first chorus of ""Can't Go Back,"" a danceable bop about accepting that the life you have isn't quite the one you planned for, any remaining cobwebs had been scattered to the wind.

gwQiH8lmIeU,Walter Martin: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Dec. 1, 2017 | Robin Hilton -- Only Walter Martin would bring a barbershop quartet to the Tiny Desk. Best known as a singer and multi-instrumentalist with the band The Walkmen, Martin has spent his solo career making unabashedly joyful, sweetly innocent and playful music perfectly suited for quirky four-part harmonies. It works particularly well on the song with which he opens this performance, ""I Went Alone On A Solo Australian Tour,"" a brilliant and comical call-and-response story-song about, well, going alone on a solo Australian tour.

Like much of Martin's music, the song, from his upcoming album Reminisce Bar And Grill, is wry and plain-spoken, finding humor and heart in life's smallest moments. But unlike his previous batch of mostly children's songs (on 2014's We're All Young Together and this year's My Kinda Music), ""I Went Alone On A Solo Australian Tour"" is really a weightier meditation on where Martin finds himself in life, now, as a married middle-aged father. He follows it in this set with the equally charming if slightly more wistful ""Me And McAlevey,"" a reflection on his close friendship with a songwriter from Maine and the power of music to give meaning and perspective to life.

Martin closes with ""Sing To Me,"" his best-known song, thanks in no small part to its appearance in an Apple ad. While the original version includes a conversation sung back and forth with Yeah Yeah Yeahs singer Karen O, Martin here takes on both parts and slows the tempo down just enough to find the loneliness at the heart of what is otherwise an earnest love song.

The barbershop quartet Martin brought along for this Tiny Desk performance is known as The Glen Echoes, a group of singers he found online and met for rehearsals the day before coming to NPR.

Reminisce Bar And Grill is due out early next year on Flottante Music.

C4-0Q8W8Nb0,Moses Sumney: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Nov. 29, 2017 | Bob Boilen --Moses Sumney puts a great deal of thought into the heartfelt music he creates. On his debut album, Aromanticism, he was inspired by everything from the works of Plato and Aristophanes' account of the origin of humanity to the Bible, particularly Genesis and the story of creation. It's all in an attempt to understand human relationships and the sorts of couplings we tend to be drawn to. But despite the working and reworking it took to put these ideas to song, and to then make his brilliant debut, there's a spontaneous side that you'll see in this Tiny Desk Concert.

The concert opens up with Moses not behind my desk, but at the piano we keep in our office. As his team of sax, harp and guitar players set up, Moses sat at the piano and began to play ""Doomed."" He had instructed the band, which had already perched behind my desk 40 or so feet away, to create a transition for him to walk from piano to desk, continuing one of the most inspired 8-minute stretches I've witnessed here at the Tiny Desk. And there was more to come.

If you don't know this Los-Angeles-based force of nature, and haven't heard him on tour with James Blake or Sufjan Stevens or perhaps on albums by Beck or Solange, then this is your chance to watch one of the most thoughtful talents of today as he makes music that is outside the box but easy to relate and connect to.

-hLJNZSIwP8,Phoebe Bridgers: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Nov. 27, 2017 | Stephen Thompson --Phoebe Bridgers' songs come laden with sly, finely detailed observations about unsuccessful flirtations with hypnotherapy, unsettling conversations about Jeffrey Dahmer, and everything in between. Her phrasing is impeccable — warm, cool, conversational, gently slurred — but her songs also swim in the self-aware obsessions and messy meanderings of an unquiet mind.

Joined by Ethan Gruska and Rob Moose, Bridgers popped up at the Tiny Desk a couple weeks after the release of her full-length debut, Stranger In The Alps. Together, they celebrated the occasion with languid renditions of three of the album's best songs: the sad and seductive ""Demi Moore,"" a drastically muted ""Motion Sickness"" and a piano-driven take on Bridgers' first-ever single, ""Killer.""

JeRXCjZQAHM,David Greilsammer: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Nov. 27, 2017 | Tom Huizenga -- Like a good mixtape from a friend, performances by David Greilsammer tend to range widely in repertoire and surprise with cunning juxtapositions. On a recent album for example, the Israeli pianist alternated sonatas by avant-garde pioneer John Cage and baroque master Domenico Scarlatti.

For this Tiny Desk appearance, Greilsammer assembles similarly strange bedfellows. He begins with his muse Scarlatti, the 18th-century Italian whose 500-some keyboard sonatas are compelling, colorful snapshots of his decades-long service to Spanish royalty. In the Sonata in E, you can hear a little street band processing along with trumpet fanfares. Greilsammer follows by jumping ahead 175 years to the eccentric Frenchman Erik Satie, who not only owned seven identical gray velvet suits but, with a freewheeling spaciousness and humor in his music, is often thought of as the precursor to everything from minimalism to new age. His series of mysterious pieces called Gnossiennes strike a particularly sedate mood, capable of neutralizing any source of anxiety.

Lastly, Greilsammer takes a left turn to Leoš Janáček, the idiosyncratic Czech composer from the early 20th century, acclaimed for his operas. He set one of them on the moon; another, the dramatically taut and emotionally wrenching Jenůfa, is perhaps the most undervalued opera of a generation. But Janáček also wrote in smaller forms. His piano cycle On An Overgrown Path plays out like a diary of musings, nervous tics, simple pleasures and mysteries. Within the claustrophobic tension that pervades ""The Barn Owl Has Not Flown Away,"" you can hear the rustling of wings and the repeated four-note bird call.

For Greilsammer, who recently performed in a working crypt in Harlem, threading these disparate musical fabrics together comes as naturally as, well, playing behind a desk in an office building.

Set List

Domenico Scarlatti: ""Sonata in E, K. 380""

Erik Satie: ""Gnossienne No. 3""

Leoš Janáček: ""The Barn Owl Has Not Flown Away"" (from On An Overgrown Path)

23kmzrsjmCU,Ledisi: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Nov. 21, 2017 | Suraya Mohamed --Singer and songwriter Ledisi is a veteran R&B queen, which she immediately affirmed at the Tiny Desk with her powerful opening tune ""Let Love Rule."" It's the title song of her latest album, and a dazzling display of vocal range and technique. And yet, it hardly showcases the full scope of her artistic expertise. Classically trained, Ledisi is also celebrated as a jazz artist, which she clearly demonstrated when she broke out into a effortless scat outro on her second song, ""I Blame You.""

With nine Grammy nominations and an impressive discography, it's easy to be awed by her musical accomplishments. But in person, what's just as impressive as her exquisite artistry is her radiant spirit of contentment and grace. You can see it when Terrell, her makeup artist, goes behind the desk between songs to powder her face. (It was an exceptionally hot day.) Ledisi responded to the interruptions not like a diva, but with humor, humility and gratitude.

The lyrics to the third song, ""Add To Me,"" speak to having self-confidence and ensuring self-care in any relationship: ""I've been in a spiritual space / So when it's getting hard, don't break / Show me you're a winner, I don't need a quitter / How you gon' add to me?"" Ledisi finishes the set with a tribute to Prince and even more positive messaging. ""High"" is about being high on life — a reminder that no matter what chaos and circumstances exist, we should all find one good thing to love every day.

oaSN_bHjyIw,Billy Corgan: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Nov. 20, 2017 | Robin Hilton -- Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan is a complicated guy. In the years since that iconic and much-beloved rock band broke up in 2000, Corgan has continued to put out music under various names and projects – including several releases as Smashing Pumpkins, with different lineups – while often stumbling through a bumpy minefield of his own making. To the head-scratching surprise of some longtime fans, he's gotten heavily involved in pro wrestling, talked conspiracy theories during several appearances on The Alex Jones Show (warning of weaponized zombies in one interview), and, over the years, lobbed innumerable grievances about former bandmates, while trashing other musicians and publicly feuding with a revolving cast of celebrities and public figures.

More recently, Corgan seems to have mellowed. He opted to release his new solo album Ogilala, under his (very grownup-sounding) full name, William Patrick Corgan (though he very recently changed it back to Billy Corgan on streaming services and YouTube), and filled the record with beautifully rendered acoustic songs built on piano and strings.

When he settled in for this memorable Tiny Desk performance with a string quartet he'd just met hours before, Corgan was nothing but a good-natured delight. After years of selling millions of records and playing packed arenas, he showed up in a cab with just his tour manager and, during setup and rehearsals, joked about being all DIY now.

Dressed for winter weather in a heavy scarf, hoodie, down jacket and cap, Corgan opened with a stirring rendition of the 1995 Smashing Pumpkins song ""Tonight, Tonight."" It was a transporting moment that left some fans in the NPR offices a little misty eyed. Corgan then followed with two Ogilala standouts, ""Aeornaut"" and ""Mandarynne,"" songs about staying strong and true to yourself and soldiering on in the face of a troubled world.

The Smashing Pumpkins always had a soft side, from the more melancholy moments of 1991's ""Rhinoceros"" to ""Sweet Sweet,"" ""Take Me Down"" and Adore's gorgeous opener, ""To Shelia."" But here the beauty and grace of Corgan's poetry and songwriting is on full display.

Set List

""Tonight, Tonight""

""Aeronaut""

""Mandarynne""

I48camns7KY,Benjamin Booker: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Nov. 17, 2017 | Bob Boilen -- 
Benjamin Booker has a deeply tender voice that, at times, can feel like a whisper But it always cuts to the heart. ""Believe,"" his opening number at the Tiny Desk has a yearning for something to hold on to, something to understand. It's a timeless desire which can be about the personal or the political. But on the second song, ""Witness,"" the title track to his 2017 album, the 28-year-old New Orleans-based singer bears witness to both the racism he's experienced and the hatred still prevalent in our culture and reflected in the daily news.

The title cut is sung here with Saundra Williams (you may recognize her singing alongside the late Sharon Jones on a previous Tiny Desk Concert). The song reflects on two main questions: Will we be a witness to the wrong in the world and is that enough?

It's a potent message that questions the meaning of Booker's own life, but also asks listeners to question the meaning of theirs. The music bears the same sensitivity as the message and that's felt most powerfully in the restrained guitars that punctuate this heartfelt performance.

-jVqp8SvZHE,"Now, Now: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","Nov. 15, 2017 | Daoud Tyler-Ameen -- Now, Now's breakout album, Threads, was not as much about breaking up as holding on. Its songs carried in them a weary recognition of how desire and nostalgia linger in the body and mind, and zoomed in on the brittle filaments that bind together people who have long since declared themselves better off apart. ""I can sleep, I can sleep, I can sleep — soon,"" went one characteristically fraught line, teasing relief and then snatching it away as guitars cracked and rumbled like fireworks.

There's not much material evidence of how the band's next move might be different, but what little we have to go on is striking. Now, Now took the Tiny Desk stage with a minimal setup (dig the sampler as drum kit) that laid the vocals bare, but still lent the songs a room-filling pulse. Among those songs were ""SGL"" and ""Yours,"" the two singles that heralded the band's return this summer (a full five years after Threads, with a pared-down lineup and no album yet announced, though the rumors say next year). As their performance here makes clear, KC Dalager and Bradley Hale have added a few new tools to their arsenal — synth-forward arrangements, that triplet swagger you loved from ""The Wire"" and ""Run Away With Me,"" the word ""baby"" — but their focus on tiny moments between people just outside of love is as sharp as ever. If there's more where this came from, 2018 can't come soon enough.

l0MqlDbZ_as,Aminé: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Nov. 14, 2017 | Rodney Carmichael -- 
Considering all the unique monikers MCs have concocted throughout the history of rap, Aminé — Adam Daniel's middle name by birth — isn't all that strange. But that hasn't kept him from becoming the hip-hop artist with the hardest-to-pronounce name of the moment. He's been called everything from anime (as in Japanese animation) to amino (as in the acid). But after watching the Portland native perform three songs from his Good For You debut album, with a four-piece band and background singer crammed behind Bob Boilen's Tiny Desk, Aminé (pronounced ah-MEE-nay) should be hard to forget.

His debut single ""Caroline"" is definitely recognizable after peaking at No. 11 on Billboard's Hot 100 last year. Aminé followed it up one year later with an LP that expanded on his colorful pop chops with R&B-styled grooves and a mannish flow that's given his hometown more mainstream hip-hop cred than it's enjoyed since Fred Armisen fumbled through the history of rap on an old episode of Portlandia.

Despite openly criticizing Donald Trump during an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, the closest that Aminé — a son of Ethiopian immigrants — came to making a political statement here was a funny aside about the imposing gate in front of the White House. Instead, he made his music the focus, while taking occasional sips from a big red cup of tea.

As for the bananas that have become Aminé's well-known trademark, several NPR interns gifted him with a bunch right after his set. And with so many fans in the audience, he didn't even have a reason to pause and pronounce his name until it was time to say goodbye.

kp-I1dEH3Uw,Mynabirds: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Nov. 10, 2017 | Bob Boilen --For Laura Burhenn, 2016 was a tough year and she wasn't alone. We lost David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Prince (and so many more beloved artists). And then there were the elections and subsequent inauguration, which were devastating to many. But what transpired next for anyone dismayed by those events was inspiring: The Women's March united many who were in despair, while giving purpose and focus to what for them was an unthinkable outcome in the election of Donald Trump.

Then came the songs – nine new ones Laura wrote with Patrick Damphier, inspired by the many marches around the country, listening to the news, seeing social media, talking to friends and taking it all in. The result is The Mynabirds' politically charged 2017 album Be Here Now.

I first met Laura Burhenn ten years ago for a songwriting project she did with John Davis, her then bandmate in the duo Georgie James, here at NPR called Project Song. I was thrilled to discover her talent. Her current band, The Mynabirds, are Tiny Desk alum, Laura having played her first Tiny Desk Concert in the spring of 2010.

I'm not one to repeat artists at the Tiny Desk. I'm more into discovering and challenging new bands to play in this intimate and awkward setting. But this project was so different and Laura had ideas about how to make it even more special from what she'd done back in 2010, so I couldn't resist.

While recording this album, a travel ban was issued affecting six Muslim-majority countries. She wrote a song for refugees inspired by the ban and got in touch with friends back in Omaha at the Refugee Empowerment Center. It is there she learned of the Umoja Choir whose members include resettled refugees from The Congo, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia and they ended up singing on her record. Laura also started a GoFundMe campaign for them to record their songs. Now some of those choir members have come to the Tiny Desk for a powerful set of songs. They're joined by another Tiny Desk alum: Jessica Lea Mayfield. It's an inspired project that I'm excited to share.

T7xWl50pKyo,Ani DiFranco: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Nov. 8, 2017 | Stephen Thompson -- 
In a career spanning nearly three decades, Ani DiFranco's music has evolved in countless ways, reflecting everything from a major relocation (from New York to New Orleans) to her acquisition of a funky, shimmery backing band. But she's also kept her core values intact, from her outspoken commitment to progressive social causes to her strenuously maintained independence from the machinery of the music industry.

For her Tiny Desk debut, DiFranco brought a hell of a backing band, with drummer Terence Higgins and singer/violinist Jenny Scheinman joined by none other than Ivan Neville on keyboards. Together, they lend a slithery underpinning of funk to three songs that stretch across much of DiFranco's career. After opening with ""Dithering,"" from 2014's Allergic To Water, DiFranco introduces ""Play God"" (from this year's Binary) with a monologue about reproductive rights and gender relations; later, she and her band close with 1998's ""Swan Dive,"" which she calls ""an early attempt at a happy song.""

For DiFranco, now 20 albums into a fruitful career, happy songs come easier than they used to; like anyone who's done anything steadily for 28 years, she's in a different place than she used to be. But on a fundamental level, she's the same tough and uncompromising singer-songwriter she's always been.

EhnLJwmEy_k,Wyclef Jean: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Nov. 6, 2017 | Bobby Carter -- Wyclef Jean doesn't get his just due. It was only after The Fugees had the world in their collective palms, and then disbanded, when we got to know his unadulterated abilities as a musician — his first solo album The Carnival was a project equal to (if not greater than) his greatest successes with The Fugees. From there, his focus shifted to discovering and producing stars, stretching all genres in his solo mission, and philanthropic work for his homeland of Haiti.

A seasoned pro, he walked through our doors greeting and charming anyone within arm's reach. Once in front of an audience, he was in attack mode, playing every instrument in sight. Clef doled out stories ranging from his upbringing and rise with The Fugees to intimate musical encounters with Whitney Houston and Destiny's Child. The mentions were properly placed and added substance to the performance, but to me, he pulled what I'd call a ""subtle stunt."" Hip-hop is and has always been about youth and freshness, so most elder statesmen of rap aren't celebrated to the degree of their peers in rock 'n' roll and country music. Every now and again it's necessary to inform the younger generation, who would otherwise never know these epic moments ever happened.

Over the past few years, we've seen a resurgence of sorts for Wyclef. Young Thug noted a heavy influence, naming a song after him and then tag-teaming on a different track on last year's Jeffery; one of the biggest songs of 2017, DJ Khaled's ""Wild Thoughts,"" prominently samples Wyclef's colossal collaboration with Carlos Santana on ""Maria Maria."" His career trajectory was recently documented on TV One's Unsung, and in September he dropped the third installment of The Carnival. He starts his set with two highlights from his latest record, and finishes with a climactic rendition of his signature hit like you've never seen or heard.

peYcNm3JTe8,Nate Smith + KINFOLK: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Nov. 3, 2017 | Suraya Mohamed -- Rhythm is the foundation for many a musical experience. Its driving pulse yields a power that quite often demands movement - a toe to tap, a body to sway. But drummer Nate Smith provides more than just a beat. He intentionally weaves nuanced rhythmic counterpoint in and out of his catchy melodies and dulcet harmonies.

Just try to discern the multiple time signatures in the first tune, ""Skip Step"" Syncopated yet steady, its rhythmic motifs bolster Jon Cowherd's keyboard riff and the song's melodic statement, played in unison by saxophonist Jaleel Shaw and guitarist Jeremy Most.

The quintet slides right into ""Retold,"" a beautiful song with a nostalgic melody that suggests a quiet moment for personal reflection and self-discovery. On ""Pages,"" Smith welcomed vocalist Amma Whatt to the stage (so to speak). She wrote the lyrics for Smith's 2017 album Kinfolk: Postcards From Everywhere, his first eponymous record after a 15-year career performing with other jazz artists like Chris Potter and Dave Holland.

What really impressed the audience was the performance of Smith's self described ""short but angry"" final tune, ""Rambo: The Vigilante."" Hypnotized by its shifting time signatures, this fusion jam is punctuated with a haunting rock lick played simultaneously by the entire band, and seamlessly aligned with Smith's dazzling display of dexterous genius.

sNAil6VlchE,Gracie and Rachel: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Nov. 1, 2017 | Bob Boilen -- On first hearing the Gracie And Rachel song ""Only a Child,"" I was struck by the tension and the mystery, both musically and lyrically: ""I'm moving my mouth but I don't say a word/My ears are open but nothing is heard/I'm only a child, only a child.""

Gracie Coates, the primary singer and keyboard player, wrote and told me, ""It was this notion of going in circles, trying to move forward but constantly feeling like I was right back where I'd started."" Along with Rachel Ruggles on a violin processed through various pedals, the two Berkeley California high school friends – now New York loft-mates – have made one of my favorite albums of 2017. Together with percussionist Richard Watts, a huge bass drum, and electronic drum pads, the group mixes classical training with pop hooks, and curiosity with uncertainty.

The complex tunes they beautifully reproduced in this thrilling Tiny Desk performance are from the group's debut, self-titled album released back in June of this year.

Oct. 30, 2017 | Abby O'Neill -- Can you believe it? Yes, those are The Roots packed behind the Tiny Desk. Black Thought, Questlove and the crew carved out a few hours in their hectic Tonight Show schedule to visit NPR headquarters in Washington D.C. Why travel four hours for a 12-minute concert when you own the late-night airwaves? The answer can be found in the lyrics to The Roots' new song, ""It Ain't Fair.""

Armed with the incredible vocalist Bilal, The Roots performed the signature track from Detroit, a film about the race riots in 1967. ""It Ain't Fair"" glares unflinchingly, takes a knee and raises a fist against the societal construct that has systematically denied equality of experience to those ""presumed inferior,"" to quote one of Bilal's verses. And it achieves all this while covering its heart with its right hand. This reflective hymn tenderly yanks your heart strings and offers a window into the ethos of those who would like to stand for the flag but cannot in good principle, lest these same evils continue to exist.

Those lucky enough to be in the Tiny Desk audience witnessed masters at work. Black Thought is truly one of the most intelligent emcees ever, and his razor-sharp lyricism was on full display. Questlove, a musical and cultural historian nonpareil, was both a metronomical and moral anchor. It felt like the culmination of decades of academic rigor and boom-bap sessions, fittingly backed by a seven-piece horn section. Bilal's falsetto-laced vocals and warm resonance evoked powerful messaging reminiscent of Curtis Mayfield's ""Don't Worry,"" delivered with the eccentricity of Prince.

Late last year, Common premiered ""Letter to the Free"" at the Tiny Desk and later won an Emmy for the song. It wouldn't surprise me if ""It Ain't Fair"" becomes another award-winning performance when the Oscars roll around early next year. This is a song that deserves to be heard in the millions of households that watch The Roots every night.

Oct. 27, 2017 | Felix Contreras -- Natalia Lafourcade is a successful singer-songwriter whose voice and music live on the edge of pop, but maintain a distinct independence.

A few years ago, while Lafourcade was traveling Brazil, she felt a great nostalgia for her native Mexico and its folk music. When she finally returned home, she immediately called some friends for the kind of party that is ubiquitous in Latin America: lots of social drinking, lots of food and lots of guitars and singing. Classic folk songs were on the playlist and a good time was had by all.

Someone recorded the informal jam session and Lafourcade's management team heard the tapes. ""This is your next record!"" they told her.

That record, Musas: Un Homenaje al Folclore Latinoamericano en Manos de los Macorinos, Vol. 1, was a commercial and critical hit, and received a Latin Grammy nomination for Album of the Year. It only made sense for Lafourcade to bring her Musas tour to the Tiny Desk. The performances are an ode to a magical time in Mexican popular music, one that is revived with every note this singer and her band perform.

One important historical note: The two older gentlemen on the video are Juan Carlos Allende and Miguel Peña, two revered musicians who played with the iconic ranchera singer Chavela Vargas.

Set List

""Soledad y el Mar""
""Mi Tierra Veracruzana""
""Tú Sí Sabes Quererme""

MUSICIANS

Natalia Lafourcade (vocals), Ernesto Anaya (traditional Mexican guitar), Uriel Herrera (drums), Jorge Molina (double bass), Juan Carlos Allende [Los Macorinos] (acoustic guitar), Bernardo Ruiz (electric guitar)

tK4gaJwXw_4,Japanese Breakfast: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Oct. 25, 2017 | Marissa Lorusso -- As Japanese Breakfast, Michelle Zauner writes sparkling, opulent dream pop about grief and love (and, occasionally, robots). After releasing its debut album, Psychopomp last year, the band returned with this year's stunning Soft Sounds From Another Planet. Where Psychopomp, written in the immediate aftermath of the death of Zauner's mother, zeroed in on the experience of Zauner's grief, Soft Sounds widens her aperture, featuring paeans to her coping mechanisms, ruminations on crooked relationship dynamics and said sci-fi robot fantasy.

At its Tiny Desk concert, the band swapped out Soft Sound's gauzy, astral synths for acoustic guitar and piano, and was joined by members of Washington, D.C. string quartet Rogue Collective. Zauner had wanted to do something special for the performance, and was tipped off by Landlady's Adam Schatz that the Rogue Collective make pretty great Tiny Desk partners. The Collective practiced with Japanese Breakfast the day before the Tiny Desk, and was a featured guest later that night at the band's D.C. show.

The adaptation highlighted Zauner's strength as a songwriter, providing an even more direct line into the raw emotion at the heart of her songs. The string swells during ""Boyish"" lent gravity to the song's bittersweet desperation. During ""Till Death,"" her ode to marriage, Zauner sang — as she often does — in a way that strains her voice to the crackling, taut edge of heartbreak. It's arresting on any stage, but particularly powerful in the stark midday light of NPR Music's office.

For its final song at the Tiny Desk, Japanese Breakfast performed ""This House."" Gone was the Rogue Collective, and indeed much of the band — just Zauner and pianist Craig Hendrix remained. The song describes moments in love that are more fearful labor than bliss, the hazy space where commitment, confusion and longing intersect. Like much of Japanese Breakfast's music, the performance shows Zauner looking unblinkingly at fear and pain, daring us to do the same.

4wQUv87URYU,Shabazz Palaces: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Oct. 23, 2017 | Rodney Carmichael -- ""... Only the exalted come in and rock with us.""

With those words, spoken in the opening moments of Shabazz Palaces' Tiny Desk performance, Palaceer Lazaro (aka Ishmael Butler, also of Digable Planets fame) lays the ground rules for all present to enter the group's metaphysical headspace.

And, man, talk about being transported to the other side. It's impossible not to envision the Seattle studio, Black Space Labs, where Shabazz's otherworldly soundscapes emerge to provide the ideal backdrop for shining a light on the fake.

From the beginning, with 2011's Black Up, Shabazz's practice has been steeped in black magic of a different order. The same proves true on its latest two releases, the conceptual Quazarz vs. The Jealous Machines and Quazarz: Born On A Gangster Star. Leave it to hip-hop's unorthodox lot to conceive an ambitious pairing that launches the narrative's protagonist on an interstellar journey far from home. It's the perfect proxy for the growing sense of alienation we're all suffering, to some degree or another, in today's space and time.

While the premise of Tiny Desk usually involves artists stripping down their set, Shabazz Palaces' entire steelo is about unplugging from the metaphorical matrix, and sometimes a hybrid of digital-analog plugins is exactly what it takes to navigate alternate dimensions.

Set List

""Colluding Oligarchs""
""They Come In Gold""
""Shine A Light""

Ishmael Butler, Tendai Maraire, Otis Calvin

GkUY-aVuNQo,The Perceptionists: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Oct. 20, 2017 | Abby O'Neil -- Mr. Lif and Akrobatik are two emcees whose names rock bells among true hip-hop heads. The duo of Boston natives first teamed up as The Perceptionists in the early aughts to release Black Dialogue on El-P's Def Jux label in 2005. Their side project went into indefinite hiatus soon afterward, but now Lif and Akrobatik are reunited on their new LP, Resolution. While Lif has been touring and writing with downtempo icons Thievery Corporation for the greater part of the last seven years, Akrobatik's last solo album (2014's Built To Last) rightfully received a warm reception from critics and connoisseurs.

Their conscious ethos is perfectly encapsulated by Ak's lyrical run on ""A Different Light,"" where he raps: ""But I'm above all of the melodrama / When they go low / We go high / Michelle Obama."" The song tells the story of Ak's near-death experience with a pernicious aortic dissection, as well as the betrayal of a close friend during his convalescence. Akrobatik took the high road, and that ironclad stoicism lights the path for this crew. On the same track, Lif laments love lost while rhyming his way to healing catharsis following an unmanageable heartbreak.

With sharp, heartfelt lyricism, The Perceptionists critique the current political climate on ""Out Of Control"" and rhyme about the symbiotic human relationship with technology on ""Lemme Find Out."" In a world that often appears to be spiraling out of control, their Tiny Desk set provides a much-needed breather.

zhVgbZdMdb0,Thundercat: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Oct. 18, 2017 | Bobby Carter -- Thundercat, born Stephen Bruner, is willing and able to shape-shift to fit into just about any box you show him — he just won't stay in there for long. Whether fusing his talent for jazz while a bassist with punk legacy act Suicidal Tendencies or as a member of Snoop Dogg's band — maybe running a little too far with a solo here and there — the focus seems to eventually drift his way.

After releasing two brilliant solo albums, he was plucked to work on what eventually became one of the most important works of art released this decade: Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp A Butterfly. Capitalizing off of the new exposure, he quickly released the EP The Beyond/Where the Giants Roam. That was followed about two years later by Drunk, his most solid project to date.

I didn't know what to expect in the days leading to the performance, but I was hoping to get what I thought a Thundercat experience would be like. All boxes ended up checked: He arrived wearing a neon pink hoodie with his signature logo plastered about, kickboxing shorts, white chancletas, playing a Nintendo portable gaming console. He and his bandmates Dennis Hamm, Justin Brown and Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, all master musicians in their own right, polished off some bacon croissant sandwiches and proceeded to give us three of the best of what Drunk has to offer.

rb4tXqPI7NU,Hanson: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Oct. 16, 2017 | Stephen Thompson -- The audience for Hanson's first Tiny Desk concert could be cleanly sorted into two distinct camps: the curious and the committed. The curious were the ones who'd inquired about whether the band would play its 1997 smash ""MMMBop"" (answer: nope), or wondered what Isaac, Taylor and Zac Hanson have been up to since the '90s (answer: touring constantly, putting out records, starting their own label, raising families, launching a music festival, developing a line of Hanson Brothers-branded ""MMMHops"" beer). As for the committed? They were psyched.

For those who haven't kept up, Hanson has maintained a lovingly ravenous fan base. The night before this performance, the brothers played to a joyous sold-out crowd at Silver Spring, Maryland's 2,000-capacity Fillmore — and, it turns out, some of those 2,000 folks work at NPR. (A few even had friends fly in for the occasion.) We tried to get the committed as close to the Tiny Desk action as possible, because the vibe in the room was special.

This year marks Hanson's 25th anniversary as a band, and it's been 20 years since the release of Middle of Nowhere, the album that made stars out of the Hansons when Isaac was 16, Taylor was 14 and Zachary was 11. With a greatest-hits collection just out — it's called Middle of Everywhere — this was a perfect time to catch up on a few post-""MMMBop"" career highlights. That meant opening with ""Thinking 'Bout Somethin'"" (from 2010's Shout It Out) and ducking back to 2000 for the title track from This Time Around before closing with Hanson's charmingly infectious new single, ""I Was Born.""

Oh, and as the tagline at the end of the video cryptically notes: ""To be continued..."" We'll just leave it at that.

1wFWR5qCB2k,Randy Newman: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Oct. 10, 2017 | Bob Boilen -- I think Randy Newman is a national treasure. If he was just a funny guy making music, I'd be OK with that, but his wit is sardonic, satirical and politically on point. Mixing politics and humor with music is usually about the punchline, and his punchlines even make the singer smile.

Randy Newman paints lasting portraits of places and people, all the while poking fun and highlighting injustice, stupidity, power and humanity and he's been doing it for half a century. Here are the opening lines to his recently released song ""Putin"":

""Putin puttin' his pants on / One leg at a time / You mean he's just like a regular fella, huh? / He ain't nothing like a regular fella.""
His new album, Dark Matter, is his first batch of songs in nine years and there's more than the usual biting Newman wit; there's also a tender heart. And watching the 73-year-old songwriter amble to the Tiny Desk and singing these words, had me crying for sentiment so full of heart:

""I'm not much to talk to, and I know how I look / What I know 'bout life comes out of a book / But of all of the people there are in the world / She chose me.""
Watch this grand master play.

Set List

""Putin""
""She Chose Me""

WEzNvKpMyvg,Landlady: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Oct. 6, 2017 | Bob Boilen -- Landlady's music is more than sonic exploration, it's an adventure. The Brooklyn-based band's songs are the initial creation of leader Adam Schatz, who observes the world with fresh, almost alien eyes. The songs can feel a bit drugged-out – a bit high and full of curiosity – but never overly intoxicated or out-of-touch.

The opening track for Landlady's Tiny Desk performance, ""Cadaver,"" has its origins in a friend of Schatz's who went to medical school, and the years she spent examining a single cadaver over and over and even more specifically about a tattoo on that cadaver's buttocks.

Landlady is also a band of brilliant musicians who carefully craft their playing to serve the songs. Each player on their own might seem to be making quirky sounds or playing odd rhythms, but together they create head-turning tunes.

For their Tiny Desk Concert they came in as a foursome but also recruited the Washington D.C. string quartet, Rogue Collective to flesh-out their sound on the third song, ""Electric Abdomen."" That cut, which seems to be about being uncomfortable in your own skin, sounds like it came from a long-lost tape from The Beatles during a session for Abbey Road, full of wonder and, like this Tiny Desk performance, worth digging deep into.

_t-nRXwAL1k,Paramore: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Oct. 2, 2017 | Lars Gotrich -- Paramore's After Laughter captures the moment between rapture and its comedown, the glitter wiped away, left with skin rubbed raw. It's a record, more than a decade into the band's career, that not only exposes the sparkling pop that's always lit Paramore's songs, but also deals with the ache of growing up and growing apart. When Hayley Williams sings, ""Tell my friends I'm coming down / We'll kick it when I hit the ground"" from the '80s-tastic jam ""Hard Times"" at the Tiny Desk, the stark dichotomy is laid bare by the band's stripped-down performance that still packs a small synth and Zac Farro's drum machine into its Afro-pop-flecked textures.

Backed here only by guitarist Taylor York, ""26"" is Williams' letter to a younger self, to still believe in dreams, knowing its costs. Paramore's quieter songs have never quite shown this depth of understated devastation and determination, and Williams reflects that nuance in a voice that scales the end of the line, ""And they say that dreaming is free,"" with just the slightest trail of regret.

These songs extend After Laughter's themes, racing across the spectrum of hope, with ""Fake Happy"" as a soaring anthem to expressing your truest self (and calling out those playing pretend). At the Tiny Desk, the shimmering guitars and synths almost become tropical, as if the band's all taken a big swig of Drake's ""Passionfruit"" and started a lowkey jam among friends.

Welcome the world of Dawg Yawp, the musical concoction of Rob Keenan and Tyler Randall, where drones and toy pianos are likely to collide with heavy metal electronics and a well-placed melody.

It's also a vessel for humor, experimentation and foot-stomping fun, whether that stomping is to an original techno beat or a classic bluegrass tune. In fact it was the duo's cover of ""East Virginia Blues,"" a song made famous by the Stanley Brothers that first won my heart when I heard them replace the more traditional banjo with a sitar.

These two Cincinnati high school friends create endearing tunes with roots in fingerpicking folk tunes but with a sense of adventure. Listening to their debut, self-titled album is like listening to kids music made for grownups. It's both clever and wonderfully weird. They always put a smile on my face.

tFdebIZJah8,Chronixx: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Sept. 27, 2017 | Abby O'Neill -- Reggae has long been the most vivid musical escape for me. Its soul-cleansing riddims always feel familiar and cozy, like rushing into your lover's arms after a significant time away. This is especially true for roots reggae, whose staccato guitar licks, billowing bass, and sonic splashes on a canvas of negative space, are like salve for the soul. The mid-tempo pulse varnishes heads with Kool-Aid grins and daydreams of living beachside amid nature's unrestricted beauty.

Given all that, you can understand why I've been obsessed with Chronixx lately. At a time when dancehall has been dominating the Jamaican soundscape, its refreshing to hear the man born Jamar McNaughton carrying the roots-revival torch for a younger generation and expanding upon the footprint left by his world-renowned predecessors.

Chronixx and his band Zincfence Redemption paid a long-awaited visit to the Tiny Desk to perform three songs from his sophomore album, Chronology.

ZyHipL45pwM,Steve Martin and the Steep Canyon Rangers: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Sept. 25, 2017 | Robin Hilton -- It's hard to think of an artist who's brought more joy to more people, across more generations — and in more ways — than Steve Martin. In the 1970s, he won the hearts of young children for his playful appearances with The Muppets while simultaneously charming legions of older fans with his subversive standup routines. Later, as an actor, he wrote and starred in some of the most memorable comedies (and a few dramas) of all time, while writing books, plays and even a Broadway musical.

Throughout his 50-year career, one constant in Steve Martin's life has been the banjo. It was a staple of his early standup shows and even fans who only wanted to laugh couldn't help but marvel at his playing. Over the years, he's continued to perform and record with country and bluegrass luminaries like Earl Scruggs, Dolly Parton, Vince Gill and others.

These days Martin is working on music full-time. He's just released a stellar bluegrass album he recorded with The Steep Canyon Rangers called (perfectly) The Long-Awaited Album, a record filled with often hilarious story songs and world-class performances.

Martin's set with The Steep Canyon Rangers at the Tiny Desk was at times thrilling, particularly his opening solo for the song ""So Familiar."" But it was also playful, comical and a joy to witness. At the end of the typical three-song performance, the group graciously decided to do one more called ""Caroline,"" a hilarious, first-person account of how not to handle a breakup.

Set List

""So Familiar""
""All Night Long""
""On The Water""
""Caroline""

Musicians

Steve Martin (banjo, vocals), Woody Platt (guitar, vocals), Mike Ashworth (percussion), Mike Guggino (mandolin), Charles Humphrey (bass), Graham Sharp (banjo, vocals), Nicky Sanders (fiddle)

3oY-GQVzAX8,Bomba Estereo: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Sept. 22, 2017 | Felix Contreras -- If the Tiny Desk offers one lesson, it's that greatness doesn't diminish with less volume. The lesson doubly applies here.

During their performance, Bomba Estereo's Simon Mejia (bass and keyboards) observed that it was the quietist the band has ever played; they rose to the occasion with an intense performance that reflects their earliest days working smaller venues in Colombia.

Band leaders Mejia and Li Saumet (lead vocals) have been consistent in their devotion and homage to Afro-Colombian music throughout their five albums, and steadfast in their fantastic mash-up of electronic music, creating a sonic signature that has become popular around the globe.

But you won't hear that on this video.

What you'll hear is the power of their songwriting and arranging with this stripped-down presentation— which helps remind us of why we fell for this band in the first place.


Set List

- ""Somos Dos""

QLRxO9AmNNo,SsingSsing: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Sept. 21, 2017 | Bob Boilen -- One look at (and listen to) the cross-dressing, Asian rock band SsingSsing and you would hardly think they're singing music inspired by traditional Korean folk. But SsingSsing isn't like any other band I've ever seen or heard.

The group sings a regional folk style called minyo and the gender bending look has to do with shamans not glamour. As singer Hee-moon Lee describes it, ""In Korean traditional art, male shamans, called baksu, have the body of a male. But as mediums, they need more than a single sexual identity, because they're channeling both male and female spirits. When I act a female character and sing, I have to overcome the fact of my being a male sorikkun (singer), and try my utmost to bring a more neutral, unisex feeling to the performance. It sounds silly, but I feel like going back to the sensibilities of my youth, when I liked Madonna, helps.""

The understated music, the small dramatic gestures and the costumes all combine for one of my most memorable Tiny Desk Concerts of all time.

Set List

""Minyo Medley""
""Nanbongga (Song of Beloveds)""
""Saseol Nanbongga (Narrative Song of Beloveds)""

MUSICIANS

Hee-moon Lee (vocal), Da-hye Choo (vocal), Seung-tae Shin (vocal), Young-gyu Jang (bass guitar), Tae-won Lee (electric guitar), and Chul-hee Lee (drums)

21ix1OwPoY8,Snail Mail: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Sept. 15, 2017 | Lars Gotrich -- Snail Mail's sleepy songs have a way of waking you up. They rumble at a steady pace like a scrappy rock band playing to a small room, but then Lindsey Jordan, who just graduated from high school this past spring, drops a line like, ""So if you look death right in the face, don't thank him / Because there's nothing and there won't ever be."" You can feel the room nod in solidarity, and you could feel the NPR Music office do the same when Snail Mail performed ""Slug.""

Encouraged by punks in the Baltimore scene, Jordan started Snail Mail at 15 and released the quietly stunning Habit EP via Priests' in-house label last year. She's quickly found fans in Helium and Ex Hex's Mary Timony (who also happens to be Jordan's guitar teacher) and just went on tour with Waxahatchee and Palehound. Oh, and she once made blueberry pancakes with me on a short-lived NPR cooking show because clearly my kitchen is the path to success.

Jordan's joined in this performance by what's become her consistent live band (drummer Ray Brown and bassist Alex Russell), giving weight to both ""Slug"" and the soaring coming-of-age anthem ""Thinning."" Because we often ask bands to turn down for the office space, she jokes, ""I guess I don't really know what we sound like because we're so loud. Now we're quiet and Ray's using the mallets and my guitar's all the way down — I was like, 'We sound like this?'""

Jordan closes the set solo with a new song, ""Anytime."" It is, perhaps typically for Snail Mail, slow and sad, but the alternate guitar tuning and Jordan's drawled vocal performance gives this song about a crush an aerial motion, like acrobats sliding down a long sheet of fabric.

Habit is out now via Sister Polygon. Snail Mail goes on tour with Beach Fossils in October.

Set List

""Slug""
""Thinning""
""Anytime""

JpYCCcWlxNo,L.A. Salami: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Sept. 13, 2017 | Bob Boilen -- Lookman Adekunle Salami, who writes and records as L.A. Salami, is a storyteller and a poet. His songs are deliberate meanderings on the mundane and the poignancy in everyday life. And in the way Bob Dylan took his guitar and harmonica to accompany his rarely repeating ramblings, L.A Salami embraces a similar aesthetic, albeit as a black Englishman instead of a white Minnesotan.

His opening song at the Tiny Desk, ""Day to Day (For 6 Days a Week),"" runs about six minutes, with over 600 words. He seems to rattle them all off effortlessly, with compelling, complicated rhymes that never repeat and phrases such as:

""Went to work for the NHS -

Mental health, people depressed.

Met Joanne - Scared of living,

Afraid of dying, terrified of being.

Then met Paul, a schizophrenic,

Shaking limbs, paranoid fanatic -

Unwashed 10 days in a row -

So afraid almost paralytic.""

L.A. Salami released one of my favorite albums of 2016, Dancing With Bad Grammar, which was produce by Matt Ingram, known for his creative work with artists as diverse as Laura Marling and FKA Twigs. So if you have a penchant for broadside ballads, and observations of our times reflected through the mind of a brilliant songwriter, take a look at L.A. Salami.

Set List

""Day To Day (For 6 Days A Week)""

""Terrorism (The ISIS Crisis)""

""My Thoughts, They Too Will Tire""

Musician

QCtkkX2f18M,Bleachers: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Sept. 12, 2017 | Jacob Ganz -- Two songs into his Tiny Desk concert, Jack Antonoff revealed a bit of stagecraft behind his performances with Bleachers.

""My manager says, 'When you play for 1,000 people, don't talk to one person. It's only cool for them,'"" Antonoff said. It was offered as an apology — he had just finished aiming a monologue about the link between dancing and crying at a single NPR staffer in the audience — but it was also a perfect encapsulation of the connection Antonoff's songs create. Bleachers makes truly conversational pop, songs that sound expansive but retain a sense of intimacy, even when aimed at the masses.

At the Tiny Desk, Antonoff, along with pianist Mikey Hart and multi-instrumentalist Evan Smith, pared away much of the pomp that can turn Antonoff's layered studio productions into neon-lit melodramas rollercoastering toward catharsis. On three songs from this year's album Gone Now impeccably re-arranged for a smaller space, it was impossible to miss the cracked longing at the heart of Antonoff's work.

""If you ever see Bleachers live, it's two drum sets and it's big and it's kinda like this big statement that I could hide behind the tears with this big rock show. But the songs are written like this,"" Antonoff said before launching into a version of the '80s-drenched single ""Don't Take The Money"" that was all feathery keyboards and spoken word verses — plus a brief quote from Queen's 1984 hit ""Radio Ga Ga. ""

Not that he could resist a well-placed gimmick. ""Don't Take The Money"" was the only song of the day to include drum sounds, which came from a cassette tape in a boom box over which a microphone had been draped. He started the song by hitting play on the cassette, but it took three tries to nail the ending in time with Hart. For this group, seeing the flaws is part of the charm.

Set List

""Everybody Lost Somebody""
""Don't Take the Money""
""Foreign Girls""

MUSICIANS

Jack Antonoff (vocals, keys); Evan Smith (vocals, keys, sax); Mikey Hart (vocals, piano)

NPlZQ5L8yUY,Frances Cone: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Sept. 8, 2017 | Bob Boilen -- When I listened blindly to nearly a thousand songs while attempting to make my schedule of bands to see at this year's SXSW music festival, one of the few tracks that leapt to the top was ""Arizona"" by Frances Cone. I wasn't alone. NPR Music's Stephen Thompson also singled out this now Brooklyn-based band for the way it wraps its storytelling in a catchy, pop parcel.

Led by singer and songwriter Christina Cone, the band is set to release Late Riser, its second full-length album, later this year. The first track the group performed for this Tiny Desk concert is its just-released single, ""Unraveling,"" a tale of falling apart, of life becoming so overwhelming that the song's character simply stops and lets go.

With each verse of ""Unraveling"" the saga builds to a climax and then a calm. It's this sort of craft that makes Frances Cone stand out. Think Lucius, another band that captured my attention years ago for similar reasons. In fact, Dan Molad, the drummer and producer for Lucius, mixed that first Frances Cone song that grabbed my attention, ""Arizona."" This is wonderfully literate pop that won't hit you over the head, but might gently find a home in your heart.

Set List

""Unraveling""
""Arizona""
""Leave Without You""

Musicians

Christina Cone (keys, vocals); Andrew Doherty (electric bass, electric guitar, vocals); Adam Melchor (electric guitar, acoustic guitar, vocals); Alex Baron (drums)

h-_YEiac55s,Jidenna: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Sept. 5, 2017 | Bobby Carter -- ""Classic Man,"" the 2015 debut single from Nigerian-American MC Jidenna, caught everyone off guard. The song found him teetering between rapping and singing about elegance, politeness and Nat ""King"" Cole, and the melody felt irresistible. Then there's the look: He rocks thrift-wear tailored to a T. The song eventually went double platinum and earned a Grammy nomination. Jidenna followed it with a few more club bangers before releasing his debut album, The Chief, earlier this year. A tribute to his father, a Nigerian chief, the record is peppered with African rhythms and themes.

Jidenna and his band recently visited NPR to perform three reworked selections from The Chief. They excitedly explored every nook and cranny of the Tiny Desk in search of props, eventually settling on a toy, the magic microphone, a tambourine and a bottle of whiskey. Jidenna bounced straight through ""Trampoline"" to ""Long Live the Chief,"" in which he explains why his threads are always so sharp:

You can either sink, swim or be the captain
Get the last word I'ma get the last laugh in
Now they say, ""Jidenna, why you dressing so classic?""
I don't want my best-dressed day in a casket 

Finally, the band pauses, glides into the arresting harmonies of ""Bambi,"" and finishes charming the socks off the entire room.

Set List

djUh1eHdepE,Jason Isbell: Tiny Desk Concert,"Aug 28, 2017 | Stephen Thompson - Like many singer-songwriters, Jason Isbell writes music that mirrors developments in his own life. In recent years, that's thankfully included the hard-won contentment he's experienced on his path to 40: sobriety, marriage and on from there. On this summer's The Nashville Sound, the decorated Alabama-born star understandably casts his gaze toward parenthood — a job he's recently come to share with singer, fiddler and Tiny Desk veteran Amanda Shires — but expands his scope further to encompass politics, fear of obsolescence, and his place in the world. It's a gorgeous record: noble and scruffy, graceful and human.

For his Tiny Desk debut, Isbell and his band The 400 Unit performed three songs from The Nashville Sound, but their set fanned out to include lengthy bits of funny banter, a false start and an impromptu bit in which he shone a spotlight on a member of the audience. ""This is like an audition and a rock show at once,"" he deadpanned to Ashwin Wadekar, a guest in the building who — not to spoil anything — got more than he'd likely expected from his visit to NPR headquarters.

Pvn20PjBa3k,DJ Premier & The Badder Band: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Aug 21, 2017 | Abby O'Neill | Three-time Grammy winner DJ Premier, one of the definitive architects of New York hip-hop, brought a new type of life to NPR's Tiny Desk: our first concert helmed by a DJ.

A packed house of head-nodding journalists grooved through their lunch hour to a nine-song medley of iconic Premier productions while decompressing from the unrelenting grind of the news cycle. The set list rested on the undeniable footprint of Preemo's classics, but this was more than just another DJ mix. His touring outfit, The Badder Band, overlaid Premier's blends with an undulating electric bass courtesy of Brady Watt, a steady accent on the one from drummer Lenny ""The Ox"" Reece and boisterous horns from Mark Williams and Jonathan Powell.

But it was Premier who remained front-and-center, commanding the crowd like a true party rocker. With throwbacks ranging from Gangstarr's ""Step into the Arena"" to an amped rendition of Jeru The Damaja's ""Da Bitches,"" embellished by The Badder's jazzy horns, Preemo concluded the set with a ""Moment of Truth,"" featuring the exalted rhymes of his posthumous Gangstarr partner, Guru.

Tiny Desk concerts are short by design, so naturally the format could barely scratch the surface of Premier's vault of street anthems, done for the likes of the Notorious B.I.G., JAY-Z, Nas, Kanye West, Big L, M.O.P., Mos Def, Group Home, Jeru the Damaja, AZ, Snoop Dogg, and many more. Even after a career spanning almost three decades, the man born Christopher Martin has managed to stay authentic to his analog grit and sample-chopping integrity, as if he were still an underdog.

SET LIST

""Premier Production Medley""

- KRS-One - ""KRS-One Attacks""

9Oy3pyPxRo0,ALA.NI: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Stephen Thompson | August 14, 2017 -- The moment you get a look at ALA.NI behind the Tiny Desk, you'll notice it in the foreground: The singer asked us to record her set using her vintage RCA Ribbon microphone, which she carries around in a small briefcase between shows. It's a security blanket, a bit of visual branding, a statement of stylistic intent — and, not for nothing, a big reason ALA.NI's voice carries with such warmth and intimacy.

The microphone isn't the only element of ALA.NI's sound that seems to have been transported from another era. The London-born, Paris-based singer draws inspiration from her uncle, a British '20s and '30s cabaret star by the name of Leslie ""Hutch"" Hutchinson, and writes her own songs in the style of the standards he sang. You & I, her debut album, reverberates from the same spirit: It captures and conveys a reverent love of early-20th-century music, while injecting those sounds with charisma and charm well suited for any era. Here, she performs four songs from You & I, before closing her set with a heartwarming, crowd-aided ""Happy Birthday"" to her accompanist, Marvin Dolly.

You & I is available now.

SqPtIkxSxI0,Maggie Rogers: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Stephen Thompson | August 7, 2017 -- Maggie Rogers became a viral star on the strength of a video in which Pharrell Williams raves about a demo of what's become her signature song, ""Alaska."" Since then, Rogers has signed a label deal, toured extensively and released a sweetly approachable, inventively arranged EP called Now That The Light Is Fading.

For her Tiny Desk debut, Rogers performed all three of the EP's best-known songs, opening with the recent singles ""On + Off"" and ""Dog Years,"" the latter of which she calls ""a song for all the pups."" Then, after dismissing her band, she treated us to a few warm words about public radio before introducing ""Alaska"" — a song whose buoyantly clever arrangement translates beautifully to the solo acoustic treatment she gives it here. She needn't have buttered us up; we were already all in.

B-oxSercnbQ,Diet Cig: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | Aug 2, 2017 - The high-energy blast that musicians often reserve for their finale is the starting point for Diet Cig.

The band's boundless, leaping pop is exhilarating and pleasantly exhausting to watch, with drummer Noah Bowman propelling the high kicks and constant pogo bounce of guitarist and singer Alex Luciano. With a candied voice, she sings of being on the cusp of adolescence — but underneath that bright veneer Alex sings truth to power, and about what it means to be a punk in a skirt, dealing with disrespectful souls. ""I think you're the kind of guy / who would meet me at a party / and forget my name / and try to take me home all the same,"" she sings on ""Sixteen.""

These songs, which crackle like Pop Rocks — and in this case stomp, as Alex dances on my desk — retain a simple fun that makes them memorable, without undermining their gravity.

U6ToeaeuOQo,Aldous Harding: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | July 28, 2017 -- Intensity in songs often expresses itself as volume – a loud guitar, a scream, a piercing synth line. But in the case of Aldous Harding it's in the spaces, the pauses, and her unique delivery. Watch her Tiny Desk Concert and you can see this in her facial expressions and body posture.

The first song she performs,""Imagining My Man,"" is about what she calls the ""tender and frightening thoughts that come with being in love,"" and what you witness while watching her are often painful, pensive expressions that are as important to the song as the notes being played.

Aldous Harding is a singer from New Zealand who's inspired by British folk singer Vashti Bunyan, but making something truly unique and her own. Party, her second album, is full of deeply personal songs with memorable melodies and spare instrumentation that linger in my head long after the headphone batteries have drained. It'll certainly be a favorite on my year-end list.

Aldous Harding's musical partner for the Tiny Desk is Jared Samuel, a keyboardist who was so impressive at SXSW this year in the band, Invisible Familiars. It's his deft accompaniment on these songs that shapes the texture and pulse of them, adding tension to already taut tunes. Aldous Harding's music isn't universal, but if you lean toward loving the poetic, the melodic and the mysterious, you'll likely love it.

Tid0nlwfvAI,The Shins: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | July 24, 2017 -- The Shins have been a constant part of NPR's musical DNA for much of the 21st century. The group's poetic pop has shown up in something like 25 stories on our website, not just because many of us are longtime fans, but also because our listeners love them. Stories on our site include: The Best CDs of 2003: Listeners' Picks, The Shins In Concert from 2012, Song Premiere: The Shins And Zach Braff Reunite, a recent interview on All Things Considered and so many more. It's remarkable that there's never been a Tiny Desk Concert from The Shins until now.

In celebration of the band's fifth studio album, 2017's Heartworms, singer and guitarist James Mercer, the emotional and creative center of The Shins, came to NPR to perform a handful of songs that included two new tracks and one that reached back to 2003 from the album Chutes Too Narrow. It's a moving performance with just James on guitar, no band, no amplification - simple and perfect.

kc2i9pwSSqE,Albin Lee Meldau: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Robin Hilton | July 20, 2017 -- Few singers can command an audience's attention quite like Albin Lee Meldau. When I first saw him perform, at a church in Austin, Texas during South By Southwest last March, it felt like the entire audience was on the edge of its seat, hanging on every twisted word. His voice is breathtaking, soulful, thunderous and impossible to ignore.

Watching Meldau in this Tiny Desk set, the first thing you'll notice, apart from that voice, is how possessed he is by the music. The words and melodies seem to take hold of him while at the same time offering a release, if only for a moment, from the knot of emotions he's carrying inside. It's in no small part because Meldau's music is so personal, centered on desperate souls in deeply troubled times. ""Lou Lou,"" the track he opens with and his most popular song, is a story of drug addiction and mental illness, inspired by a girl he knew while growing up in Sweden. He calls ""Bloodshot,"" the track he closes with, ""dark and horrible,"" about the wreckage of a tortured relationship and the crazed paranoia of jealousy. His other two songs, ""Mayfly"" and ""Persistence,"" are more about hanging on when it seems there's nothing left to live for.

Meldau grew up in Gothenburg, Sweden the son of musical parents. His mother is a music teacher and jazz singer, while Meldau says his father is a ""punk rocker."" (Both write and record their own songs.) As a kid, Meldau originally played trumpet but mostly dreamed of being a professional soccer player. Now, as a full-time musician, he says his dream was to play the Tiny Desk.

""It's a deep honor to be here,"" Meldau told the NPR audience. ""I've been to the BBC and now I've been here, so now I can die."" So far, Albin Lee Meldau has released two EPs — Lovers late last year and Bloodshot, out today (July 21) on Astralwerks — with a debut full-length out later this year.

ysGErZcZRGY,Rare Essence: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Suraya Mohamed | July 19, 2017 — Dominated by drive and momentum, heavy on percussion and bass, go-go music is all about the beat. Live, ""songs"" can continue on for half an hour, as the percussion continues to simmer and punctuate between and across different pieces. ""That's why we call it go-go, because it goes on and goes on and goes on,"" as guitarist Andre Johnson put it in a documentary film.

While the Tiny Desk doesn't allow for that kind of expansive get-down — though they did play seven songs — this visit by Rare Essence perfectly encapsulated the genre's incomparable meld of soul, R&B and, most importantly, funk (with a dash of Afro-Cuban influence).

Rare Essence emerged not long after go-go itself did, beginning as a group in 1976 in Washington D.C. Ever since the group has kept a steady schedule playing around town and around the world — they have ten shows scheduled for the month of July alone.

At the Tiny Desk, the group's closer brought everyone home — much too soon, no matter how late — with ""Overnight Scenario,"" a classic. Sing along when you hear it...

Three in the morning, the Pancake House
Four in the morning, we'll be rolling to my house
Five in the morning, the lights go out
Six in the morning, you can hear her start to shout
Seven in the morning, she'll be calling a cab, calling a cab...
Eight in the morning, talking 'bout the fun she had
Nine in the morning, she just getting home
Talking about the overnight scenario, scenario...

X_BzysUbsYw,Fragile Rock: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | July 14, 2017 — For just 15 minutes on a glorious spring day in Washington, D.C. — the town that birthed ""emocore"" three decades ago — National Public Radio became National Puppet Radio. Rarely has a news organization had this much fun.

It was the real-life breakup of band leader Brently Heilborn that led to the formation of the woefully woven band Fragile Rock. But these aren't just any puppets — no. They are emo puppets, armed with drums and guitars and glum tales to tell, with songs like ""Wake Up to the Breakup"" and ""I Am Sad (And So Am I)"" that which draw from the spastic boogie of The B-52s and the laments of The Smiths. At one point, you'll see Fragile Rock empty a bag of ""bloodied"" socks, tossing them into the crowd, before breaking into the song ""Socks Are Murder,"" a playful take on The Smiths' thoughtful ""Meat Is Murder.""

And in the spirit of the day Fragile Rock managed to crowd surf a puppet bringing giggles to a crowd of reporters, editors and friends, while puppets depicting NPR hosts Susan Stamberg, Michel Martin and Robert Siegel (the latter actually received a playful kiss from none other than Nina Totenberg) — all created by NPR's own puppet master Barry Gordemer — objectively observed.

0WyqHfJOj-I,Tuxedo: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | July 17, 2017 — The pairing of Tuxedo is a natural feel in person, but highly unlikely on paper. Seattle-based producer Jake One has a who's-who client list, from Rick Ross to 21 Savage — while DJ, singer-songwriter and producer Mayer Hawthorne is a renaissance soul man from Ann Arbor, Michigan. They stealthily debuted three tracks on SoundCloud in 2013 with only a black square stamped ""Tuxedo"" as the cover art, leaving fans wondering where this new funk was coming from. A few months later they unveiled their identities along with a debut self-titled LP, resurrecting a sound popularized by greats like The Gap Band, The Fatback Band and Roger Troutman.

When Tuxedo arrived at NPR and Mayer Hawthorne spied a small 'Ho!' button sitting on Bob Boilen's desk, he immediately beamed. ""We use a big 'Ho!' button on tour,"" he said. They didn't bring a drummer, opting for a boombox — yes, a real boombox playing a real cassette tape, kids — and it was nostalgic delight from the start of the cassette's hiss. The band was tight as ever, while their ace in the hole, Gavin Turek provided dance moves and the sweetest harmonies. Tuxedo set things off with a fan favorite from their first album, along with two from their latest, before closing it out with a red light special. It's one thing to go against the grain for the sake of it — and another completely make it good. In this Tiny Desk concert, Tuxedo accomplished both.

rDJeYMel81Y,Jay Som: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | July 10, 2017 — Jay Som is the project of 23-year-old Melina Duterte, who has been creating music for the past 10 years or so on a multitude of instruments, from guitar to trumpet. Though she played every instrument on her newest record Everybody Works, her touring band here at the Tiny Desk gave a rougher edge to some of the more premeditated sounds on her wonderful album.

Of the three songs they chose to bring to the Tiny Desk, one was a personal favorite from Everybody Works: ""The Bus Song,"" which is a perfect swirl of stream-of-consciousness:

Take your time
Won't be long till our car breaks down
Your hands in mine
Feel like a firefighter when I take off your shoes

Before concluding with a thoughtful nod to her partner:

Take time to figure it out
I'll be the one who sticks around
And I just want you to lead me
And I just want you to need me

It's lyrics like this, alongside the comfy, no-frills directness of Duterte's delivery, which make Jay Som feel so welcoming and refreshing.

-kWbZvVU-e0,Chance The Rapper: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Robin Hilton | July 5, 2017 — Chance The Rapper knew he wanted to try a different approach for his Tiny Desk performance, so he decided to do something he said he hadn't done in a long time. He wrote a poem. More specifically, he wrote a poem in the short time it took him to ride from his hotel in Washington, D.C. to the NPR Music offices. Calling it ""The Other Side,"" Chance debuted it in the middle of his remarkable set, reading from his notes written out in black marker on sheets of typing paper.

""I still have all the keys that are of no use to me,"" he began. ""They used to, though. On the other side was a mansion on a hill, complete with L.A. pools and fireplaces and a rim made specifically for people that lie about being six feet to dunk on.""

Chance didn't get much further before he was interrupted by one of the hazards of performing in an actual, working office: a building-wide page for someone to call the mailroom. But Chance rolled with it, cracking a quick joke before starting over again.

The night before arriving for his Tiny Desk set, Chance performed for more than 23,000 people at Jiffy Lube Live, an outdoor theater in Bristow, VA. The sold out arena and amphitheater shows of his current tour offer a stark contrast to the first time I saw Chance in concert back in 2013. Then, he was a 19-year old upstart rapping and singing for a handful of people at a tiny club in Austin, Texas. A lot has changed since then, and quickly. Chance's most recent mix tape, Coloring Book, was widely ranked among the best albums of 2016 (some called it a masterpiece) and featured collaborations with a cast of hip-hop luminaries, from Kanye West to Lil Wayne and T-Pain.

Chance's poem ""The Other Side"" was sandwiched between an opening version of ""Juke Jam"" from Coloring Book and another special gift just for his Tiny Desk appearance, a moving cover of Stevie Wonder's 1974 song ""They Won't Go When I Go.""

Coloring Book is available now:

p0x3aKmEu7M,Helado Negro: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Helado Negro | June 30, 2017 — The artist Helado Negro (Roberto Lange) made a very big impression on me when I first experienced him almost eight years ago. It was a sound I had never quite heard, and I was immediately drawn in; there were layers of synths, percussion that percolated rather than pulsed, vocals that epitomized the world ethereal and lyrics in Spanish and English that floated amidst the music like wisps of smoke.

I caught his live show in Mexico City and in Austin, Texas and each time the spectacle of theater and elaborate presentation were just as important as the music (including two dancers covered in what can best be described as Christmas tree tinsel).

But that's not what you're getting here — instead of tinsel, we get Roberto standing behind Bob Boilen's desk in a t-shirt that says ""Young, Latin and Proud,"" the title of his most recent single. That's the essence of the songs he chose to play (and really, his entire catalog), music about being a young American with Ecuadorian parents, singing about life in here in the U.S.

Our little concert here also shows off an acoustic treatment of Helado Negro's vision, and it's just as compelling without the electronics. In fact, it's as if the songs reveal a different aspect of themselves, the lyrics intimate and laid bare. Personally, I loved the sound of the alto and tenor saxophones playing harmonies in place of a bank of keyboards. As you'll see, the entire band perfected that delicate balance of intensity and low volume, letting the music and ideas breathe.

This performance was a long time in the making, but the payoff is clear, presenting an artist in full command of his craft.

NEUD2CkKn8o,Ravi Coltrane Quartet: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Suraya Mohamed | June 26, 2017 — Yes, Ravi Coltrane is the son of the John Coltrane, one of the most famous and important jazz saxophonists and composers of all time. He's also the son of multi-instrumentalist, composer and spiritual leader Alice Coltrane Turiyasangitananda. (In fact, all members of the band here are performing artists in their own right and come from artistically rich families; drummer E.J. Strickland is the brother of saxophonist Marcus Strickland; Adam Rogers parents performed on Broadway and Yunior Terry is Yosvany Terri's brother, both heirs to Cuban music royalty.) But pedigree is not what makes him (or them) special. It's the ability to draw on ideology and theory from the past and give already-great music the room to transform. As Coltrane told NPR back in 2013:

As improvisers, that's really our goal — not just to state the themes that people wrote. In the course of time, night after night you search for better ways to present the music.
Not only did Coltrane and his band offer new interpretations from his repertoire, but varied the rhythmic presentations of the numbers, too. The first song in the set, ""Cobbs Hill,"" was written by Coltrane's good friend and colleague Ralph Alessi. Beginning with Yunior Terry's funky and deliberate bass line, further enhanced by intentional drum rolls the 2/4 time signature, two beats per measure, captures a march-like proclamation.

The second song is Coltrane's own composition, ""Three For Thee"", a fan favorite from the 1998 Moving Pictures album; the original recording included Ralph Alessi on trumpet. Only 32 years old when that record was released, it could be taken as a sign of things to come: Ravi Coltrane, an old soul in a young body, mature and capable of creating work so robust and important. Almost 20 years later, hearing that music again here, even better, is affirming and a testament to Coltrane's ever-evolving artistic journey. And E.J. Strickland's opening drum intro couldn't be more spunky; he teases the audience into the groove with effortless, intentional punctuations.

This performance is likely to be a historical footnote in the book of great jazz moments. The quartet demonstrates its marvelous technical capabilities and keen musicianship, and their imaginative interpretations suggest strength and resolve, a fluid embodiment of question and answer, push and pull, and rising action followed by hypnagogic culmination.

5q-cdf4170A,Holly Macve: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Stephen Thompson | June 23, 2017 — Holly Macve's voice seems to hover from era to era, coming to rest somewhere between the lonesome twang of Patsy Cline and the moodily modern slur of Lana Del Rey. Macve's songs lope and shimmer at a lazy pace, but they never lack drama, even as she holds herself motionless.

The Brighton-based singer-songwriter recently stopped by the Tiny Desk to perform three songs from Golden Eagle, her debut album. Whether performing on acoustic guitar (for ""No One Has The Answers"" and ""The Corner Of My Mind"") or piano (for Golden Eagle's epic title track), Macve remained in complete command. Backed by a suitably low-key band, she'd sound subtly radiant just about anywhere, from your nearest country bar to the most dreamily lit stage in Twin Peaks.

OX-gMWH9qTQ,Tigers Jaw: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Lars | June 19, 2017 — The new album from Tigers Jaw, spin, revels in quiet pleasures, even as its rich production pulls power from the band's open wounds. It's the major-label debut from a band that, at one point, made yelping and earnest pop-punk before finding its way to intricate, and melancholy, pop.

After the lineup shake-up three years ago, Ben Walsh and Brianna Collins both step into larger roles as the primary songwriters and singers, here playing songs from spin stripped down to an acoustic guitar and keyboard. It's a strikingly intimate format that illuminates their close harmonies that tangle like garlands, and spare arrangements that open gingerly.

ILrIEKaC450,Penguin Cafe: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | June 16, 2017 — The music of Penguin Cafe is like no other. Its origins date back to the early '70s, within fever dreams Simon Jeffes had that were brought on by food poisoning. In those dreams he imagined a dispassionate world ""where everyone lived in big concrete blocks and spent their lives looking into screens. In one room, there was a couple making love lovelessly. In another there was a musician sat at a vast array of equipment, but with headphones on, so there was no actual music in the room."" Eerily accurate.

But he also imagined a place, the Penguin Cafe, where folks could gather, for pleasure, cheer and music. He wanted to hear what that music would sound like, and so created the Penguin Cafe Orchestra. I was always a huge fan of that original music; listeners of NPR may have heard it often in-between news stories during the many years I directed All Things Considered.

While Simon Jeffes died in 1997, his son Arthur has been creating new music infused with his father's original inspiration. He calls his group, simply, Penguin Cafe. You can hear Brazilian sounds in the rhythms, classical and minimalism in the strings, Asia in its harmonium, African sounds in the kalimbas. But honestly, it's none of these; it's a universal dream state.

If you're looking to explore further be sure the listen to Penguin Cafe's recent album The Imperfect Sea, which nods to Kraftwerk, Simian Mobile Disco and Franz Schubert. It's none of these.

O7x79AtDKEw,Perfume Genius: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Robin Hilton | June 12, 2017 — The music of Perfume Genius can be intense, shuddering with a breathtaking fragility — but also shimmying with self-assured defiance. The songs, much like frontman Mike Hadreas himself, are strong, but not hard. As he worked his way through two new tracks (""Valley,"" ""Slip Away"") and one older (""Normal Song""), there were moments that were both beautiful and unnerving, in no small part because the songs are so deeply personal. Hadreas, who years ago battled addiction and a parade of inner demons before finding love and an ever-expanding confidence, wrote much of No Shape as a love letter to his boyfriend (and Perfume Genius keyboardist) Alan Wyffels.

On ""Valley,"" Hadreas reflects on the creeping past as he sings, ""How long must we live right / before we don't even have to try?"" On ""Slip Away,"" he celebrates having emerged on the other side of darkness: ""Don't hold back, I want to break free, God is singing through your body, and I'm carried by the sound."" But Hadreas saved the most powerful moment for the final song, as guitarist Tom Bromley and percussionist Herve Becart stepped away from the Tiny Desk, leaving just him and Wyffels on keys as the two played ""Normal Song,"" a profoundly moving plea for strength in the face of an always uncertain future. ""Take my hand when you are scared and I will pray,"" sings Hadreas. ""... And no secret, no matter how nasty, can poison your voice or keep you from joy.""

The fourth full-length from Perfume Genius, No Shape, was released May 5 on Matador Records. The band's tour through the U.S. and Europe continues through the fall.

gvQ_9JDpAuU,Violents & Monica Martin: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | June 5, 2017 — The last time we saw singer Monica Martin at the Tiny Desk she was singing with Phox, her folky, poppy band based in Madison, Wisconsin. But, while that band is on hiatus, Martin took time to walk into the world of Violents, the project of pianist, string arranger and songwriter Jeremy Larson. Larson and Martin make a lovely pair and have created a subtle, soulful record — Awake And Pretty Much Sober — that benefits greatly from Laron's classical training.

It's the first full-length Jeremy Larson has released as Violents, a project that, generally, sees him joined by a different singer each outing, resulting in an EP. Clearly there was a chemistry driving these sessions, inspiring and stretching the two artists into creating a full-sized work.

Here at the Tiny Desk they performed with the string quartet Rootstock Republic, which they only had met earlier in the week. In fact, this was filmed during the first week Violents had ever performed live! It's a special collaboration you shouldn't miss — actually I almost did, running from a late train, coming from New York. If Stephen Thompson had not stopped the band to wait just a few minutes I'd have missed this rare treat. Enjoy.

gFIMU4vzi2Q,Nick Grant: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Rodney Carmichael | June 2, 2017 — We already knew Nick Grant was a sick lyricist. Then he arrived at NPR headquarters with a mild case of the flu and quickly demonstrated why the title of his debut — Return of the Cool — should be taken quite literally.

Hailing from a region where rap's young guns and lil innovators tend to defy tradition, the South Carolina-by-way-of-Atlanta native proves being a purist is not just for the old heads.

Being cut from a vintage cloth has kept him in good company. He groomed himself on high school freestyle battles before working his way up to become the first signee to Culture Republic, the new partnership started by three of the most proven executives in the game, Jason Geter (T.I., Grand Hustle), Chaka Zulu (Ludacris, Disturbing Tha Peace) and Bernard Parks (Goodie Mob, Organized Noize).

He's a sly reminder that, contrary to popular opinion, the South still has a mouthful to say — and it doesn't always have to be yelled, gurgled or Auto-Tuned to death. Sometimes it can be conveyed coolly, from a seated position, while backed by Washington D.C.'s soul garage band Black Alley, and still cut through all the noise.

8Zpkw5oEnvo,Royal Thunder: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Lars Gotrich | May 30, 2017 — Mlny Parsonz's bluesy belt has been the grounding force of Royal Thunder's stirring hard-rock for almost a decade now, and on the band's third album, Wick, the songs all knot and unravel with psychedelic power. True to its name, volume and a small army of effects pedals play a large role in Royal Thunder. But what happens when we ask the Atlanta band to unplug that... thunder?

From the first note, you could hear Parsonz's sandpaper soul blasting down the hallways of NPR. Both ""Anchor"" and ""April Showers"" are slow-burners, built up from the complex guitar interplay of Josh Weaver and Will Fiore; the acoustic treatments here turn them into proggy blues hollers. The band closes with the emotionally wracked ""Plans,"" featuring just Fiore and Parsonz. The performance is absolutely raw — Parsonz screams and beats her chest as her voice cracks, drawing power from a desperate vulnerability.

oEFqsWkkxvo,Gabriel Garzón-Montano: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | May 26, 2017 — I was, admittedly, thrown for a loop when Gabriel Garzón-Montano told me that he wanted to perform unaccompanied, just him and a piano. The meticulousness of his work is clear on his debut album, Jardin, a three-year creative process in which Gabriel plays most of the instruments, tracking them to two-inch tape, layering its overall sound. Jardin takes its title as an umbrella; fruits, bugs and other plants are the driving metaphors tying together this dense work, which blooms over successive listens. Garzón-Montano doesn't necessarily wear his heart on his sleeve — he forces you to listen and peel the layers back.

Garzón-Montano's career trajectory veers wide — living with Philip Glass for a year while his late mother played in the composer's ensemble, sitting under the minimal maestro's piano as he practiced; Lenny Kravitz making possible his first tour experience; while Drake exposed Gabriel's sound to the masses.

That decision to go it alone at the Tiny Desk made sense, though, the moment he started to play; his talent is left elegantly exposed in this unadorned performance. He says his visit to the Tiny Desk ""with just piano and vocal reminds me of what is lost when a song is fully produced and arranged — it was an exciting and vulnerable experience. I was nervous for this one.""

Here then, are three songs from Jardin, along with the song that introduced Gabriel to the world... laid bare.

f7-3kiK6F_Q,Julia Jacklin: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Stephen Thompson | May 22, 2017 — Julia Jacklin doesn't need much accompaniment: If you were to hear the Australian singer-songwriter's unadorned voice, say, echoing at the top of a stairwell, you'd most likely climb to where it leads without a second thought. Jacklin's full-length debut, last year's Don't Let The Kids Win, knows just when and how to lean in to this simplicity, surrounding her with spare instrumentation that keeps that voice in the center of the frame.

For her Tiny Desk debut, Jacklin reproduces three of that album's drowsily beautiful ballads with the aid of a backing band so restrained, you can read the effort to keep quiet on their faces. The result is a calm and careful mix of mystery and approachability, warm and cool at the same time.

HdFP4P8ZkjA,Troker: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | May 19, 2017 — Mexico City is not known as one of the international jazz capitals of the world. New York, Tokyo — even Havana. But not CDMX (the new abbreviation of Ciudad de Mexico).

There is, though, a fairly rich history of jazz in the country, going back to a guy named Tino Contreras, who has been swinging since the late 1940's (sadly no longer active) through to the Toussaint brothers (Eugenio, Enrique, Fernando), who formed a way cool fusion band, Sacbe, in the late '70s. There have been others, of course, but never enough to make Mexico a place known for jazz — until now.

The young lions of Troker hail from Guadalajara, in the north of the country, but call CDMX their home now. From that home base they are making the rounds of festivals, clubs and concerts around the world, gathering fans of their smart, creative and singular brand of jazz.

As you'll see on this Tiny Desk, this is music you can dance to. In fact, when I saw them slay a post-midnight crowd at this year's SXSW, trumpeter Isaias Flores was a dancing machine, twisting and grooving to the band's mix of swing, funk, ska, psychedelic and Mexican music.

The band's compositions are journeys — as you watch them live, keep in mind that you are indeed witnessing history being made. Hopefully, Troker and others can make CDMX a jazz destination.

d4f9X-SC_xk,Tim Darcy: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | May 15, 2017 — Tim Darcy has a gifted voice, with a delivery that triggers the Lou Reed and Roy Orbison pleasure centers of my brain. The words he delivers are mysterious and mellifluous, playing in my mind's ear long after his newest album, Saturday Night — so named because it was mostly recorded on the weekends in the midst of making his other band's second album — comes to its close.

While this new batch of songs don't fit the brashness of Darcy's band Ought, there are plenty of rough-hewn edges here. He told me in an email that he is ""not the songwriter of Ought,"" but ""one of four,"" and that he ""felt a strong need to get outside of the collaborative and get back to my roots in my own voice.""

Darcy grew up in Arizona writing poetry as a kid, eventually making his way to Colorado, then New Hampshire, before falling creatively into a life in Montreal. In addition to two tracks from Saturday Night, there's a new, unreleased song here — ""What'd You Release?"" — with Darcy joined by Toronto songwriter Charlotte Cornfield on piano.

FdBwOOwcwTU,Danilo Brito: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Tom Cole | May 12, 2017 — After four chords, the notes start to fly — Danilo Brito and his four collaborators, three Brazilians and one American, are off like jackrabbits in front of a hound, having hustled their instruments to the Tiny Desk at the end of a North American tour.

Brito a 32-year-old mandolin player, made his first record when he was a teenager, plays a type of music called choro (pronounced ""shore-oo"").

It's said that choro started in the streets and back yards and made its way to the concert hall. Brazilian musicians of all genres have drawn on choro, from popular composer Antonio Carlos Jobim to Heitor Villa Lobos, one of the giants of Latin American classical music. Its literal translation from the Portuguese is ""to cry,"" but in Brito's dextrous hands a better translation may be ""crying out to be heard.""

You can hear Brito and his colleagues play their arrangement of Villa Lobos' ""Melodia Sentimental,"" originally written for voice and orchestra, behind the Tiny Desk, but what you're actually hearing is a kind of formal Rodas de Choro, the circles of players who developed this music more than a century ago and have carried it on to the present.

Only — in the backyards, they don't wear suits and ties.

XgYT7zB3w5M,Aimee Mann: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | May 8, 2017 — ""This song is called 'You Never Loved Me' — it's another cheery, optimistic number,"" says Aimee Mann, introducing the second of four songs in this Tiny Desk Concert. She has been writing songs on the human condition — more often than not with a strong sense of humor to underpin the inevitable melancholy — as far back as the '80s, when she was the singer and bassist in Boston's The Young Snakes. Mann's newest solo record, the first in five years, is baldly called Mental Illness — clearly, there's a deep honesty within these songs. (Also: This is Aimee Mann's Tiny return, so if you're loving this, take a look at her performance with Ted Leo in their duo called The Both.)

4X-362AhbRQ,Peter Silberman: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | May 5, 2017 — This is likely the quietest Tiny Desk Concert ever.

Something happened to Peter Silberman — singer and guitarist for The Antlers, a band known for its loud, soaring crescendoes — that hushed his life. In a conversation we had, he described a medical condition related to tinnitus. He'd experienced the ringing before, but this was even more intense. ""I don't even know if ringing is really the right way to describe it, because it really sounded more like rushing water. This was at a level I'd never experienced before and it was really all-consuming, it took over. Playing music at all was out of the question. The sound of my own voice reverberating in my head was very painful — I had to just be more or less silent while this was happening.""

After a time, he tried to make music again. ""I started trying to play again and trying to sing again, testing where the boundary was of the sensitivity and of the pain. What I found was that if I sang very quietly and if I played guitar very quietly, that this would be a path for me."" The result is his first solo album under his own name, a record called Impermanence. These are songs in slow motion; the builds are less about crescendo and more about subtle change. Peter is joined by Timothy Mislock, a former guitarist for The Antlers. It's a set of songs meant to slow the pace of life. Have patience.

xNEhfztkCdc,Avery*Sunshine: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Rodney Carmichael | May 1, 2017 — Avery*Sunshine knows what love will make one do: Give up your favorite ice cream. Break up to make up. Even swear off of holy matrimony for good, only to fall head over heels again.

When the soul maven visited NPR headquarters to perform her first Tiny Desk Concert, she gifted us with the story of her own redemptive love. And a whole lot of laughs in between.

Newly married to her musical partner, guitarist Dana ""Big Dane"" Johnson, Avery*Sunshine broke down the meaning behind the title to her latest album, Twenty Sixty Four. But it was her playful charisma and those heavenly vocals that won us over, the same way she's turned such legends as Aretha Franklin and Smokey Robinson into fans.

3WocuIycshM,Antonio Lizana: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | April 28, 2017 — In many ways, the traditions of flamenco and jazz could not be further apart, but in the hands of a few Spanish jazz musicians, these two worlds commingle and find common ground. Antonio Lizana is one such musician, both a saxophonist and vocalist with one foot firmly planted in each tradition. As a vocalist he has mastered the Moorish, note-bending improvisations that make flamenco singing so beguiling, while the fluidity of ideas he expresses as a saxophonist place him in the time-honored tradition of composing while playing.

The magic of Lizana's performance behind Bob Boilen's desk happens when the two musical worlds wrap around each other, like helical strands of sonic DNA. One is no greater than the other — perfect complements that point to a common African root.

8zHdLF3-coA,alt-J: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | April 24, 2017 — As the primary booker of the Tiny Desk Concerts, I have this self-imposed rule: No artist can come back for a second visit unless there's something wholly different about what they're doing. The first time alt-J played the Tiny Desk, in 2012, they came as a four-piece; electric guitar, bass, keyboards and drums. They were a pretty new band, their album had been out a few months and they were playing in clubs for a couple hundred people, not much more.

In the five years since the band visited it has found quite a few new fans. When I heard cuts from the newest album Relaxer a few months ago I flipped and tried to think of a way to bring them back. So I wrote them, saying I'd love to have them again but that it would have to be wholly, out-of-the-box different. I told them I'd hire a brass band, an African kora player if need be, a string section... They took up the challenge. They told me to find a cellist and two violinists.

I wrote to my friend Carol Anne Bosco, a cellist, who turned out to be a huge fan of the band and helped find two violinists for the performance. About four days before the performance the band sent the string parts, written by their friend Will Gardner.

On Monday morning, the English band met the American string players and they all gathered behind my desk. As they worked their way through a first pass at ""Three Worn Words,"" I noticed them and relieved — alt-J had actually never heard the string arrangements, this was the first time. They sounded beautiful. By noon, NPR employees and friends gathered around my desk to witness this astonishing concert from alt-J, including two new songs and two old favorites. Magic.

gOwpqDhko3c,Chicano Batman: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | April 17, 2017 - These guys had me at their name.

Ever since I heard the first EP back in 2009 I've watched Chicano Batman grow, with a sound that perfectly captures dark lounges, quinceñera dances, car shows and backyard parties.

Lots of other folks have heard something in this music — since that debut the band has played some of the biggest outdoor music festivals for diverse crowds around the country.

The magic of a band like this is in the details, and their performance here allows us to fall into the non-stop groove and passion of a sound that gets better and better with each performance. See for yourself.

3N7a7bDEqMo,Ljova And The Kontraband: Tiny Desk Concert,"Anastasia Tsioulcas | April 14, 2017 - All too often, ""fusion"" is a rightfully dread-inducing term to describe music that tries to occupy several spheres at once, usually unsuccessfully. So let's not use that label on the brilliant, wide-ranging music of Ljova and the Kontraband, a group that embraces Western classical, jazz and an array of international styles including tango and Eastern European and Balkan folk music. These top-flight musicians, who hail from Russia, Lithuania, the U.S. and Switzerland, pile all of these sounds atop of each other with great glee, and emerge with creations that alight on totally new and exciting terrain.

The band is led by the composer, arranger and viola player Ljova (Lev Zhurbin), who comes by this musical eclecticism naturally: the Moscow native, who comes from a family heavily involved in the arts, has worked with an astonishingly wide and starry group of collaborators, including Jay Z, the Bollywood queen Asha Bhosle and cellist Yo-Yo Ma and the Silk Road Ensemble. In this Kontraband setting, he and his bandmates (including Ljova's wife, the preternaturally sweet-voiced, Lithuanian-born singer Inna Barmash) create performances of deep earthiness, fragile tenderness, ebullient humor and quicksilver shifts in texture. But the heart of their Tiny Desk Concert was the song ""By the Campfire,"" whose words have a long, strange history that goes back to the Middle Ages. The words originally come from 12th-century Germany; Ljova's grandfather, a noted translator, translated this poem from German to Russian, which Ljova uses in his musical setting.

But before she sang ""By the Campfire,"" Barmash gave us her own English translation of this unsettling, stunning, and perhaps even prophetic text: ""Lies and spite command the world / Suffocate its consciousness, / Truth is poisoned, dead is law / Honor killed — obscene extolled! / ... And the wisdom of our days / Teaches theft, deceit and hate.""

0SMTWfLCi8g,Sinkane: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | April 10, 2017 - Sinkane opened its Tiny Desk Concert with a song that has been a bit of an anthem for me lately. ""U'Huh"" contains the Arabic phrase ""kulu shi tamaam,"" which translates to ""everything's great — it's all going to be all right.""

Sinkane is the music of Ahmed Gallab — and such hopeful music it is. He grew up in London and has lived in Sudan and in Ohio and, these days, New York City. His band reflects his own love for music from around the world; you can hear a great New York jazz band in the rhythms of Sinkane, but you can also hear the influence of Bob Marley and the hypnotic repetition of Sudanese desert sounds.

Bob Boilen | April 7, 2017 - Last May, Tash Sultana posted a self-made video, just her in her living room with guitar, laptop and a great song called ""Jungle."" Within five days it had drawn a million views.

This 21-year-old Maltese-Australian got a guitar from her grandfather when she was three, she says, and has played it every day since. It's astonishing to watch Sultana's fluidity on her instrument, like a natural extension of her body. (She also plays bass, saxophone, trumpet, flute and more, but kept it ""simple"" at the Tiny Desk.) I thought I had a lot of energy — watching her bounce from guitar to drum machine to two separate microphones — and then hopping barefoot from looping pedal to effect pedal as she builds her songs was exhilarating and exhausting. There's more here than an exercise in virtuosity, her music is filled with adventure and ambition. These songs are rapturous and resonant.

Tash has just finished a month-long, sold-out U.S. tour.

K58JYXhb4YA,Noname: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | April 3, 2017 - Here's a fun fact about Noname's Tiny Desk Concert: It almost didn't happen. Around the time of their D.C. stop, she (born Fatimah Warner) and her bandmates got their first dose of tour sickness. Thanks to rest, medicine and our mutual excitement, she made her way into the NPR offices the following day. If there ever was a 'Noname' way of doing things, this is definitely her signature method. It's in the way she's able to muster a smile while performing a heartbreaking tale of abortion. It's those sometimes bleak, melancholy lyrics over brilliant, colorful production.

These intriguing juxtapositions are what propelled Telefone to our top 50 albums of 2016. She prefaced her performance of ""Reality Check"" by saying: ""I kind of talk in like, scramble-think, so hopefully you guys follow it."" ""Scramble-think"" refers to the clever metaphors she weaves in detailing the many ways she's dodged destiny. On ""Bye Bye Baby,"" she raps:

Somebody let the yellow in

Bye bye blue

I'm gonna fall in love again

These lyrics, their colors, represent the sector she commands in hip-hop today. The yellow: The bright side. (Of course, there's plenty of gloom and doom to rap about — especially coming from Chicago — but there's also plenty of light.)

There's an appropriate moment of silence in the office, before the applause, following her emotional medley. She asked us if we liked it. We loved it — and you likely will too.

pXtAhfQhEG4,Overcoats: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | March 27, 2017 - Overcoats' music has been undeniable for me from the first time I saw the duo perform. The deep friendship between Hana Elion and JJ Mitchell comes across in their vibrant harmonies and the bountiful dance parties that pop up as they go.

Behind those rich voices lies a spare electronic backdrop that feels spacious and refreshing. Not long ago, these songs would likely be backed by a nylon-stringed guitar, but their healthy energy feels more urgent with an underpinning drone and Joao Gonzalez's drumming at the Tiny Desk. Elion and Mitchell carry the melody, and I always find myself uplifted, wanting more.

57vvhrq2SNQ,Delicate Steve: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | March 24, 2017 — You need only watch Steve Marion's face. This fierce and lyrical guitar player, who performs as Delicate Steve, writes playful instrumental music led by hooky vocals — but there is no voice. His electric guitar is often played with a glass slide, mimicking a human being and bringing a palpable personality to his songs. The music swings from gospel to cartoon, melancholy to funny. Steve played all the instruments on his third studio album This is Steve, but in order to perform the songs for us at the Tiny Desk he brought along his band — Max Jaffe (drums); Jon Wiley (acoustic guitar); Jessica Pavone (bass guitar) and an old friend, a Panasonic FM/AM Premium Stereo Cassette hi-fi, to plug his trusty custom guitar into. The sound came out warm and a little worn, emphasizing a vocal range he loves. Enjoy their unique, charming performance.

fnIu25lXXY8,Sampha: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | March 21, 2017 — ""There's nothing new under the sun / It's never what you do, but how it's done,"" Nas rapped on ""No Idea's Original.""

Such is the case with the South London singer, songwriter and producer Sampha. His originality lies in delivery and tone, which is why he's been summoned by some of hip-hop and R&B's biggest names years before the release of his first album. (Kanye's ""Saint Pablo"" and Drake's ""Too Much,"" for example, could have lacked emotional value without Sampha's contributions.) Sampha's music is more feel everything than feel good, which is why his fans hold him so close to their hearts.

The vulnerability on his debut, Process, isn't hard to dissect, but can be downright agonizing to digest; his immediate family has been riddled with disease and ailments, with both his parents succumbing to cancer. Process finds Sampha interpreting this complicated emotional prism — and confronting his own mortality through it.

Sampha stopped by the NPR offices to perform 3 tracks from Process. The result is a Tiny Desk Concert as intimate as it gets (and that's saying something). It's just him, a piano and these heart-wrenching songs that we reckon double as coping mechanisms.

Process is available now:

QKzobTCIRDw,Tank And The Bangas: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | March 10, 2017 — Out of over 6,000 entries — more submissions than we've ever received — Tank And The Bangas won, unanimously, this year's Tiny Desk Contest. I fully expected their victory performance here at NPR headquarters in D.C. to be celebratory. I didn't know we'd all end up in tears.

This band combines R&B with hip-hop's poetry and rollercoaster storytelling, with a flair and alchemy that could only come from New Orleans. Their winning song, ""Quick,"" mixes liquor and revenge — a sort of modern day take on a great folk tale, but peppered with their own idiosyncratic flair and humor. What I couldn't see, until they took over my desk, was the depth of their lyricism and the versatility of their players. At one moment fun-filled funk, the next laid-back jazz, rhythm-driven blues — and it all flows seamlessly. And it's fun to watch: There's a magic kinship between Tarriona ""Tank"" Ball and Anjelika ""Jelly"" Joseph as they share singing roles, like two best friends finishing one another's sentences.

This is the third year that NPR Music has put out a call in hopes of finding a shining star. I'm still amazed how, after sifting through thousands of videos from abundantly talented musicians, we can find a common winner amongst a range of judges with such different musical backgrounds. But in the end, my All Songs Considered co-host Robin Hilton, Trey Anastasio (Phish), Miguel, Anthony Hamilton, Ben Hopkins (PWR BTTM), BANKS, and folks who listen to an awful lot of music — NPR member station hosts Rita Houston (WFUV), Talia Schlanger (WXPN), Stas THEE Boss (KEXP) — and myself were all equally charmed, delighted and captivated.

And so here it is, a chance to see an artist truly blossoming. It's just the beginning: A few years ago, for our first Contest, Fantastic Negrito won our hearts. This year he won a Grammy. Last year Gaelynn Lea, an unknown violinist, teacher and singer sent a video captured on a phone and won our affection and souls. A few weeks ago, her Tiny Desk Concert had been seen more than a million times. These days she's taken to the road, touring the world.

Tank And The Bangas will be hitting the road in April with NPR Music to find their new audience — I'll be along for the ride — visiting many of our member stations with help from those music-loving beer brewers at Lagunitas. I can't wait to see the reaction in these crowds' eyes, as they fill with wonder and tears like ours did, experiencing this band for the first time.

lgmw41CY1Fo,Red Baraat: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | March 13, 2017 — Red Baraat's fusion of bhangra, go-go, hip-hop and jazz is driven by frontman Sunny Jain's percolating playing of the dhol, a double-sided drum which forms the rhythmic lattice of support for their boisterous horns and guitar. And though Red Baraat graced the Tiny Desk five years ago, we had to have Jain's band back to celebrate Holi, the Hindu festival of color, of good over evil, and the coming of spring. Usually you'd see the dusting of brightly colored perfumed powders strewn in the air, covering bodies and clothing. The notion of doing that in the office was a fun thought, but the band (with my nudging) opted instead for confetti cannons and passing candied treats. It made for quicker cleanup, but their uplifting spirits lingered on, giving us a chance to shake off the final days of winter and demonstrating why music is so essential to the soul.

zM1o4OQaIEc,Maren Morris: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Rachel Horn | March 6, 2017 — It had been quite the week for Maren Morris: Four days before the 26-year-old strolled into NPR's offices, she'd pulled off a mighty duet with Alicia Keys during the 59th annual Grammys ceremony and taken home the evening's award for Best Country Solo Performance. It's no secret the Nashville songwriter-turned-performer has star power; her limber voice and the big, crossover-friendly gestures on her major-label debut, Hero, let her easily dominate a huge stage like the Grammys'.

Our small stage suited Morris and her songs just as well. She's cultivated a soulful, irreverent pop-country aesthetic that trades in trucks, bros and beer for a vintage Mercedes, female friendships and boxed wine — and which owes much of its charm to details that shine in a stripped-down setting. Take, for instance, the cash-register ka-ching that punctuates the chorus of the oh-so-sick burn ""Rich,"" or the intimate, after-hours raggedness in her voice as she sings of jaded heartache in ""I Could Use A Love Song.""

Between songs, Morris kept up a friendly banter with the audience on the other side of the desk — even shouting out Tiny Desk alumnus Anderson .Paak, who'd also been part of a memorable performance at the Grammys. By the time she got to ""My Church"" — the radio megahit that had earned her that golden gramophone, performed here in a dazzlingly pure three-part harmony — everybody was part of her congregation.

0plnzlNBxnA,Ninet: Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | March 3, 2017 — Ninet rocked the Tiny Desk in ways rarely seen.

As I watched one of the most famous entertainers in Israel today here at NPR, I flashed back to a 1976 concert I saw by a not-yet-famous Joan Jett. Ninet has that same fierce and honest conviction, is walking that same path that Jett did and poised to find notoriety in this country, which she recently began to call home.

Ninet won me over during a small concert at last year's SXSW; it was early in the day, but she was fully on fire and intense. She and her potent band have put out five albums and their most recent, Paper Parachute, is the home of the songs she brought to us. It's filled with a her husky-toned voice and guitar lines straight out of stateside '70s rock, with a Middle Eastern lean. It's a winning sound, performed by an unrestrained talent.

This band has been mixing be-bop and funk for 40 years. Around this time of year, when Mardi Gras revelry is fueled by New Orleans jazz, it was so good to feel their sounds in the office. Since today is Fat Tuesday — just before Lent and its fasts begin for some — we are sharing the party we hosted, filled with brass and sass from this fixture of great American music. Enjoy.

O5_IAndUG7g,Little Simz: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Cameron Robert | February 21, 2017 — Simbi Ajikawo, who records and performs as Little Simz, first gained widespread recognition with the release of her debut album, A Curious Tale of Trials + Persons back in 2015. Receiving praise from better-known artists like Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole, the British lyricist has been compared to the likes of Lauryn Hill for her self-reflective wordplay that shies away from the often braggadocios nature of mainstream rap music.

While on her first album Simz opted to tell stories that spoke of her childhood experiences (and the insight gained from them), on her most recent release, Stillness in Wonderland, she expands this notion of self-exploration by creating a world that pays ode to the childhood classic Alice in Wonderland. Much like Alice, Simz's newfound success has taken her on a journey that's leading her to discover a whole new world.

Only 22-years old, Simz is still early in her career. And while she's constantly challenged by the abnormal experiences that come from success, her performance for our Tiny Desk was poised and confident. Accompanied by three members from the Brooklyn-based R&B group known as Phony Ppl, Simz performed a set of three songs off of Stillness in Wonderland, including the standout ""Poison Ivy,"" which chronicles the outfall of a failing relationship. As Simz continues to grow as a musician it will be exciting to see what new worlds she brings to her audience next.

MAqIrCjOxws,Agnes Obel: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | February 15, 2017 — Agnes Obel, a Danish singer and writer of deeply alluring music, brought her work into what you could call its opposite — an office in the daylight. While the setting is a bit contrary to her carefully plotted, vocally dense songs, she mapped out a strategy which included her own reverb and monitor mix in the (successful, I think) hope of giving the Tiny Desk an aesthetic more suitable to these focused and powerful songs.

And so, today we have Agnes Obel performing three songs from the enchanting Citizen of Glass alongside her band — keeping it sonically spare with just the right touch of keyboard and cello.

0MYcKEi8zZs,Esmé Patterson: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | February 10, 2017 — There's a vibrance to the current music of Esmé Patterson that I wasn't expecting, having listened to her previous band Paper Bird. Gone are the banjos and remnants of folk music, and in their place are electric guitars — sometimes fierce and, here at the Tiny Desk, somewhat understated. She's a relative newcomer to the guitar, making it part of her songwriting only since leaving Paper Bird. But all of this instrumentation is meant to be supportive, not center-stage. At the heart of these songs, from her album We Were Wild, is a reach for independence:

I can't sit still 'cause I'm no mountain
I can't sit so still 'cause I'm no mountain
I can't sit still forever, I'm no mountain
I'm human, I'm human

If there's a thread that ties Patterson's songs together, it's discovering who you are and standing strong. She's doing that well — with a powerful and sensitive band that's got her back.

u-syZXHPcJE,Run The Jewels: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Mina Tavakoli | February 6, 2017 — Like any good pair of twins, Run the Jewels have a freaky sort of unspoken fraternity. When El-P and Killer Mike strode in with their usual uniforms — Mike in a gold chain as thick as a garter snake, El in a fitted Yankees cap and pair of blue-mirrored sunglasses — the two didn't have to do as much as nod to one another before upending three tracks from their latest LP, RTJ3, in strange and perfect symbiosis.

El-P (née El-Producto, née Jaime Meline) — rapper, producer, and all-around godfather of the backpacker scene of the late-90's — and Killer Mike — known for guest features on tracks by Atlanta's Dungeon Family in the early-aughts, solo work in the mid-to-late '00s, and perhaps most widely for his very public support of Senator Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign last year — have out-mused each other in a supergroup that somehow seems to get better, louder, and more pertinent since their start in 2013. They represent an ideal evolution of underground hip-hop to mainstream success, mixing a fundamentally activist animus with IMAX-level production without losing a speck of vital force.

On an unseasonably beautiful day in D.C., Run the Jewels was sweaty and sulfuric, ad-libbing with one another in an exchange so slick, easy, and conspiratorial, it felt like we were in on their shared language.

NwjN3UCBW14,D.R.A.M.: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | February 1, 2017 — We all love a good redemption story: We're front and center to watch our heroes get knocked down, and then we cheer for them to triumphantly rebound. What we're witnessing with Shelly Massenburg-Smith — a.k.a. D.R.A.M. — is the culmination of a story marked by resilience and stubborn strength.

Making a hit record in the music industry is extremely difficult, and in 2015, D.R.A.M.'s debut single ""Cha Cha"" was on the brink of exploding. It was getting played in clubs across the country and bubbling on the charts; the Beyhive even got a hold of it. Then Drake's ""Hotline Bling"" happened. The reports are conflicting as to the inspiration for the record, but there are glaring similarities in the sound of each. ""Hotline Bling"" was even originally billed as the ""Cha Cha"" remix by Beats 1, where the song made its debut. Needless to say, ""Hotline Bling"" practically swallowed ""Cha Cha,"" but D.R.A.M. didn't whine about it. He addressed it and went back to the drawing board, crafting another smash. ""Broccoli"" became one of 2016's biggest hits while setting up the release of his debut album, Big Baby D.R.A.M.

We recently invited D.R.A.M. to NPR to lend us his jovial spirit and brighten our workday; after all, his primary aim is to spread love through music. He was jarred by the Tiny Desk setting for a moment before the cameras started rolling. He's accustomed to touching every corner of the stage, but like a pro, he walked to the desk, activated his signature smile and bounced through various highlights from his catalog. D.R.A.M., whose name stands for Does Real Ass Music, wrote his first selection, ""Cash Machine,"" right after he'd received his first big music check.

Don't you know that I got that bag
And best believe my mama straight
I sent some bands to Tatiana
And if I brought you out I'll pay your way

What twentysomething doesn't feel this way once they step into some money? The crowd beamed more with each performance, leading up to a climactic rendition of ""Broccoli."" The energy is all fun and games, but his talent is no joke: ""Broccoli"" is nominated for a Grammy this year, right alongside ""Hotline Bling."" A victory would provide a fitting end to this chapter of D.R.A.M.'s career, but regardless of the outcome, he's already victorious: Far removed from the ""Hotline Bling"" shadow, he's already creating bigger songs and more memorable moments, like this one at the Tiny Desk.

Since its inception in Cuba in the early 20th century, the music has been designed for thoughtful and emotional consideration of the joys and pains that come with loving someone so intensely, it becomes like a religion to adore that special someone (an actual bolero lyric).

When the members of Richmond, Virginia's Miramar first heard the music of Puerto Rican composer Sylvia Rexach, they were intrigued that she wasn't as well known as other popular bolero writers. So they came up with an album's worth of her songs to cover, and have been wowing audiences across the country with their exquisite renditions of her songs.

When they pulled into NPR to play behind Bob Boilen's desk, Miramar's members made time stop with a performance that swept us off our feet, ably backed by friends of theirs from Richmond who played gorgeous string arrangements behind the band. So turn the lights down low, clear out the living-room carpet and find your dance partner for this one.

BGpmIANN5Lg,Gallant: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"January 30, 2017 | Suraya Mohamed — When Christopher Gallant was featured in Forbes' 30 Under 30 list, the testimonial came from none other than Elton John, who said, ""When I hear his voice, I just lose it."" The two even performed Gallant's song ""Weight In Gold"" together back in September.

Gallant performed a stripped-down version of that hit when he came to the Tiny Desk earlier this month, and preceded it with another of his best-known songs, ""Skipping Stones."" Written with Jhené Aiko, that tune radiates sultry intensity and passion; here, the talented Dani Ivory (who's performed as a touring member of Imagine Dragons) sits in for Aiko.

Ology, Gallant's 2016 debut, is up for a Grammy next month — for Best Urban Contemporary Album — and another of its falsetto-driven highlights opens this three-song set. On the record, ""Bourbon"" is produced with a funky, old-school, Prince-like drum track, but here, a steady drum beat grounds the hypnotic song just as well, if not better. Best of all, ""Bourbon"" gets a welcome bonus at the Tiny Desk: a guest rap by Saba, a charismatic rising star and frequent Chance The Rapper collaborator.

Ap4DtvUu7Bk,BADBADNOTGOOD: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | January 23, 2017 — BADBADNOTGOOD made a name for itself by reworking songs from the likes of Nas and Ol' Dirty Bastard, eventually catching the attention of Odd Future leader Tyler, the Creator. The masses took notice in 2015 when the group produced an entire LP for Ghostface Killah, Sour Soul. BADBADNOTGOOD has been called a hip-hop ensemble, but its foundation is clearly jazz, which provides a gateway to countless genres. On IV, the group allows that gateway to widen, adding soul and funk to the repertoire.

Still only in their 20s, the band's members never seemed intimidated by the intimate nature of the Tiny Desk; if anything, it accentuated their enthusiasm. This was their zone. They played three selections from IV — including ""Cashmere,"" which only slightly veered from the studio version, and ""In Your Eyes,"" which features Charlotte Day Wilson's vocals. The tight arrangement allowed Wilson to hover gently above the instrumentation, showing off the band's most promising work to date. It was a pleasure to have BADBADNOTGOOD at the desk for IV — and exciting to imagine what's in store for V, VI and beyond.

wuOJF8ecoY8,Brent Cobb: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Lars Gotrich | January 17, 2017 — In some parts of the South, there's an accent where every conversation sounds like a song. Brent Cobb, a native of the small town of Ellaville, Ga., doesn't quite whistle through his teeth when he speaks, but he does push more air into his S's when he sings. When he sings ""Solving Problems,"" a song about a Sunday-afternoon bull session, at the NPR Music offices, the words shimmer like a tall glass of sweet tea in the late-morning sun when he strings together a particularly consonant phrase: ""Conversation covers everything and in between, from Grandpa's health to marrying good girls.""

""Solving Problems"" comes from Shine On Rainy Day, his major-label debut produced by distant cousin Dave Cobb; it's nearly a decade in the making. Brent Cobb spent those years on Nashville's Music Row, writing songs for the likes of Luke Bryan, Little Big Town and Miranda Lambert. But where most songwriters write for the performer, Cobb plainly says, ""If I write a song, they're always for me. If someone wants to record it, I think they should record it.""

Cobb is a conversational lyricist who dispenses normal but precisely crafted phrases amid simple-yet-rich melodies. He skips from Merle Haggard's ""Mama Tried"" to family to making ""plans to do what we ain't done yet."" He takes a funny story about his uncle and bends the truth a bit for the quiet holler ""Down In The Gulley."" His songwriting lineage shines through in ""Country Bound,"" written by his daddy; here, it features a bouncing solo from J Kott, whom Cobb jokingly calls ""our bass player/lead guitarist.""

Encouraged by the crowd to play one more song, Cobb closes with the sobering ""Shine On Rainy Day."" While he weaves plenty of wit into his lyrics, Cobb can devastate just as easily: ""Ain't it funny how a little thunder make a man start to wonder, 'Should I swim or just go under?'"" Just as we struggle to find the silver lining in Cobb's clouds, the song ends and he asks with a smile, ""What do we do now?""

hU3P6dlNaB4,Lila Downs: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | January 13, 2017 — Lila Downs has spent her career exploring the furthest reaches of Mexican folk music. With a voice that borrows heavily from opera, Downs performs the kind of full-throated mariachi singing that would fit right in at Mexico City's Garibaldi Square — ground zero for mariachi.

She can also coax the most tender moments from romantic boleros. But Downs is at her best when she and her band gather all of those influences to create cross-cultural expression that breaks down musical barriers. Entertaining and inspiring, she's as much a storyteller as a singer, and her between-song banter lays bare the Mexican soul, only to have it punctuated in song.

oIbFjfH0erI,Donny McCaslin: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | January 9, 2017 — David Bowie had long wanted to make a record with a jazz band, and on Jan. 8 of last year, he realized his dream with the release of Blackstar. Two days later, he was gone. Donny McCaslin's band helped him make that record, and now, a year later, we pay tribute to Bowie and Blackstar by bringing McCaslin's band to the Tiny Desk.

It's been exciting to see jazz find its way into the broader music world in recent years; think Kendrick Lamar and hip-hop in general. Musicians such as McCaslin often play in their own small circuit, but have much to offer popular music. As a bandleader and sax player, he's put out a dozen albums, the most recent of which is Beyond Now, with musicians Tim Lefebvre on bass, drummer Mark Guiliana and keyboardist Jason Lindner.

Beyond Now was recorded after Blackstar, features a few Bowie covers and stretches the band's own usual boundaries. For this Tiny Desk concert, you can hear an extraordinary group playing extraordinary music — including an instrumental version of ""Lazarus,"" from Blackstar. Just as Bowie brought these musicians into his rock-leaning world, I hope this set takes you down McCaslin's jazz path.

Ea43VkCiyFo,Declan McKenna: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | January 3, 2017 — It'd be easy to look and listen to this young English singer and think he's just another sensitive songwriter with a guitar, singing about his troubles. But Declan McKenna writes about a much bigger world than you or I might expect from a singer who only recently turned 18. He came to NPR this past summer, a bit nervous but passionate. He stripped down three of his songs to their musical essence, and the power of their words eclipsed the hooks for which they're equally known. ""Bethlehem"" tackles religion:

Because I'm in Bethlehem
I've got a seat in heaven
And though I'm heaven sent
I can do as I want and you don't have the right to choose
McKenna's most famous tune, ""Brazil,"" is a song about football, money and poverty that also touches on religion.

I've been reading about the early years of Leonard Cohen in the wake of his death — reading about the poet before the singer, thinking about how young artists blossom. When they're good, their songs and ideas are spare and boiled down to their core. I'm enjoying Declan McKenna, and should you have missed his extraordinary past year or so, this is a good introduction. But I'm eager to fast-forward to where this young poet takes us.

55QnOlXckOk,Derek Gripper: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Tom Cole | December 16, 2016 — You probably shouldn't be reading this — just listen to Derek Gripper play and watch his fingers work. You can see and hear his classical training from his first notes behind the Tiny Desk.

The 38-year-old started on violin at age 6, then wound up with one of the few classical-guitar professors in his native South Africa. But touring the world playing the music of the great dead white men was not all that appealing (though Gripper still loves to play Bach). Then he heard a record by the Malian kora player Toumani Diabate. He decided that that's what he wanted to do: not play the kora itself, but play kora music on the guitar.

Of course, the kora has 21 strings, each tuned to a fixed note. The nylon-stringed guitar Gripper plays has six. But by using unusual tunings and fretting the strings up and down the neck with his left hand, he can pretty much hit all of the kora's notes. He shows how he can evoke the West African instrument's multiple voices simultaneously in the third piece of his Tiny Desk concert, ""Jarabi.""

The remarkable thing is, he figured all of this out — and recorded two acclaimed albums — just by listening to CDs and checking out music online. Gripper painstakingly transcribed what he heard onto a kind of notation called tablature — similar to the music written for the Renaissance vihuela, which was also an inspiration. Earlier this year, Gripper finally made it to Mali, where his efforts received the blessing of Toumani Diabate himself; the two even jammed together. Now, go back to the concert.

hJykCRucbBM,The Oh Hellos: NPR Music Holiday Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | December, 19 2016 — It seemed only fitting for us to have a nine-piece, family-centered band come back to the Tiny Desk to help us celebrate the holidays in 2016. Maggie and Tyler Heath head up The Oh Hellos vocally, but this band — which played a non-holiday show at the desk just a year ago — feels very much like an extended family, in terms of both camaraderie and harmonies.

It helps that The Oh Hellos' members are steeped in the holidays: They're currently on their Christmas Extravaganza Tour, as they play songs from their 2013 holiday collection The Oh Hellos' Family Christmas Album. It exudes spiritual fervor while also finding joy in the Heath family tradition of handbells and group singing of ""Jingle Bells"" — which yours truly attempted to ring and sing during this set. At a later point, when this Texas nonet let the high holiday fiddling kick in, fake snow and real joy filled the NPR offices with catchy Christmas cheer. Happiest of holidays from the Tiny Desk team.

wlFQjExxD4U,Gucci Mane: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Frannie Kelley | December 12, 2016 — Gucci Mane's smile makes you feel like there's still some good in the world. He's really earned it, and that thing is infectious. We asked him to come to NPR because we wanted to be a part of the victory tour he's been on this year: In the past six months or so, Gucci Mane was released early from the federal penitentiary; he proposed to his girlfriend on the kiss cam at a Hawks game, and she said yes; he's releasing a total of three albums, all over which he celebrates his newly committed sobriety; he and Courtney Love look like they get along; and he remade ""Jingle Bells.""

In this Tiny Desk concert, Gucci Mane performed with just his longtime producer and friend, Zaytoven, on piano. Their version of stripped-down is a minimal backing track and plenty of church-groomed trills. They performed with the understanding that everyone in the room knew their songs — one from 2009 and two from this year — and knew that this performance would represent a surreal dip into a parallel universe where ingenuity is rewarded, snobbery is gone and love is real. Gucci Mane agreed to this unlikely set as a gesture to those people — for remembering his work while he was away, and for cheering on his resurgence, his health, his charm and his singular nature.

daXGLo4aeFQ,Alsarah & The Nubatones: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"When singer Alsarah left her native Sudan, she was just a child who'd shown an interest in music. She's said it served as her coping mechanism during a subsequent transition to life here in the U.S. That passion led her to a university degree in ethnomusicology.

It also drew her to musicians who were passionate about the intersection of culture, music and migration. Together, their one-of-a-kind expression has been called ""East African retro pop."" But that tag only scratches the surface: In their hands, the music pulses, breathes and comes alive with a mix of tradition and contemporary influences.

Alsarah and her band The Nubatones mesmerize and enchant in this performance behind Bob Boilen's Desk. They undoubtedly opened new worlds for more than a few who saw the performance live, so it's a pleasure to share it with the world.

fKVZEfxDvcM,Ro James: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Bobby Carter | December 5, 2016 — Lots of us try to be cool, but the trick has always been in the subtleties; they're what allow us to walk that thin line between cool and corny. Enter Ro James.

Ask where he's from, and James will say, ""Everywhere."" He spent his childhood and teenage years from Germany to New York, and from Hawaii to Indiana. Rosie Gaines of Prince's New Power Generation is his aunt, so James comes by his coolness honestly. In 2013, James independently dropped his EP, Coke, Jack And Cadillacs. His debut album, Eldorado, exemplifies that cool. It's a hazy ride that explores love, lust and other vices without the lovey-dovey clichés. The album always feels current, even as his slick wordplay and acoustic vibe could easily slide it into a '70s or '90s hit list.

James and his band recently stopped by the NPR Music offices to play two tracks that seem tailor-made for a Tiny Desk concert, as well as a deconstructed version of his club jam from Eldorado. His falsetto falls right in the pocket with the lead guitar of his breakout hit, ""Permission."" This new arrangement of his follow-up single, ""Already Knew That,"" maintains the bounce of the studio version, but the restrained arrangement allows listeners to follow the playful words much better. In between songs, he asks, ""Y'all hot, or is it just me?"" — at which point a few in the audience immediately giggle and emphatically agree while fanning themselves. Ro James is still the coolest.

weL8HTY1NJU,Pinegrove: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | December 2, 2016 — There's a confessional quality to the songs of Pinegrove that feels reassuring. The problems that swirl around Evan Stephens Hall's head feel universal, so it's comforting in ""Old Friends"" when he sings, ""I should call my parents when I think of them / I should tell my friends when I love them.""

The New Jersey group's sound feels fresh and scrappy at the same time. Hall and drummer Zack Levine, who've been friends since they were 7, form the core of Pinegrove. (Their dads play music together, too.) Together, the band squeezed four songs into their 13-minute Tiny Desk concert, with Hall's voice — and a spirit of warmheartedness and friendship — at the center of it all.

S9bLHMCnCAk,Margo Price: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | November 28, 2016 — When I greeted Margo Price in the NPR garage before her Tiny Desk performance, tears were streaming down her face. It was Wednesday morning, Nov. 9, the day after the 2016 election. For her — as for many Americans — it was a stunning and bewildering moment in time, a day when life and the everyday took on new meaning. And so when she and her band began to play ""All American Made,"" a song she's sung many times before, those words about America's changes and failures in the 21st century seemed even more powerful.

Margo Price is a Nashville-based musician, the sort of country artist that captures the hearts of those both inside and outside the country-music scene. Her debut album, Midwest Farmer's Daughter, is one of the brightest moments in country in a very strong year.

As this Tiny Desk progresses, even ""Four Years Of Chances,"" her song of a love gone wrong, feels less about a lousy husband and more about presidential politics. She dedicates her third and final song, ""About To Find Out,"" to Donald Trump; she says it was originally written about a ""musician acquaintance of mine who's a complete sociopath."" When the song ends, she rips open her red cowboy shirt to reveal a T-shirt with the words ""Icky Trump""— a play on the title of The White Stripes' song ""Icky Thump,"" which criticizes the U.S.'s immigration policies. She smiles, wipes a tear away: It seems cathartic, but temporary.

1djpZqRRA7U,Tegan And Sara: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Josh Rogosin | November 21, 2016 - Six months before Tegan and Sara Quin played two sold-out shows at Washington, D.C.'s 9:30 Club, we booked their Tiny Desk appearance. Their mini-set would take place on Nov. 7, 2016 — the eve of one of the most contentious presidential elections in U.S. history. However fortuitous the timing, it felt cathartic to hear two politically active Canadian twins serenade us before we embarked on our own election.

It's hard to believe Tegan and Sara have been making music for 17 years. They still look a lot like they did when they made their first record, 1999's Under Feet Like Ours. It took eight years for many fans to become hooked, but with the release of The Con, Tegan and Sara began to develop a fiercely loyal fan base. Songs like ""Call It Off,"" ""Back In Your Head"" and ""Nineteen"" became heartbreak anthems for a worldwide audience.

Contrary to the poppy sound of 2016's Love You To Death, the two insisted on performing their Tiny Desk concert acoustically — stripping down highly produced songs while hearkening back to their early recordings. Without the distraction of production, we're left with the gorgeous sound of roughly identical voices blending. Plus, their endearing banter and jovial sibling rivalry left us defenseless against their charm.

Above all, what sets Tegan and Sara apart is how their vocals intertwine. The finest example in this four-song set comes in their hit ""Closer"" (from 2013's Heartthrob). Their voices, whether sung solo, in unison or in harmony, sound spontaneous, calculated and emotionally honest at the same time. It's no wonder they've stood the test of time while continuing to craft anthems of joy, sorrow and longing for new fans and lifers alike.

CXgO7xI7ElQ,Attacca Quartet: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Tom Huizenga | November 18, 2016 - Classical music observers say we're living in a golden age of string quartets. It's hard to disagree when you hear the vibrant young players in New York's Attacca Quartet.

They revere the old school, having recently completed a performance cycle of all 68 string quartets by Joseph Haydn, the man who invented the genre. They also hunger for the new, exploring the music of three living composers each year in a project called Recently Added.

One contemporary composer the group continues to champion is John Adams. The head-banging pulsations of ""Toot Nipple"" (titled after a character in an Annie Proulx story) contrast with the slippery and funky episodes in ""Alligator Escalator."" Adams has said he imagined such a creature waddling up and down the floors of Macy's department store. The two movements belong to John's Book of Alleged Dances from 1994.

Next to Adams, Haydn sounds positively genteel, but you needn't look far to find the composer's own feisty side. Sunny skies suddenly turn threatening at the turn of a phrase — a trend in Haydn's time known as Sturm und Drang, or ""Storm and Stress"" — when moods can swing wildly with impunity.

Measured by the cello's tick-tock pizzicato, the mood of Michael Ippolito's Smoke Rings is languid, even a little trippy. Inspired by a 14th-century French song about a smoking society, the composer employs long, slow strokes and light bow pressure for a hazy texture. The music heats up dramatically midway through, only to drift back into the smoke.

mBIAnpOrJB8,John Paul White: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | November 14, 2016 - I wasn't alone in patiently waiting for new music from John Paul White. His singing and songwriting as half of The Civil Wars was heartfelt and beautiful. This summer, a new album finally came, and Beulah was a quietly understated gem. This is tender Southern music without drawl or pretense, and I love it. White kicks off his Tiny Desk concert with Beulah's opening track, ""Black Leaf."" It's a song about loss of love, with this killer line:

""Those old butterflies, they haven't died
'Cause they're eating me alive in there""

After his solo entrance in ""Black Leaf,"" White is joined by Kelli Jones-Savoy on violin and Adam Morrow on guitar for more tunes from Beulah. White recorded these songs originally in Muscle Shoals, Ala., at the well-known FAME Studios, as well as at his own Single Lock Studios. Here at the Tiny Desk, they take on a new life of their own with new arrangements.

NIsUeV_zmA0,Adam Torres: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | November 11, 2016 - Adam Torres' voice makes Pearls To Swine a constant listen for me. It's high and lonesome, but more frail than the voices of the bluegrass pioneers who defined that sound, like Ralph Stanley. Besides, Torres isn't a country singer or a folksinger so much as an atmospheric storyteller.

It took the musician, now based in Austin but frequently on tour, just a week to record Pearls To Swine, though the album was nearly 10 years in the making. In 2006, Torres was 20 and living in Athens, Ohio, when he put out a debut record called Nostra Nova, which is worthy of cult status. Then his life took a non-musical course.

I first heard his music far more recently, through another Austin musician and Tiny Desk alum (with Shearwater back in 2008), Thor Harris of Swans. I ran into Harris, he raved about this new singer he was touring with, and I heard Pearls To Swine and flipped. I've been writing about Adam Torres a bunch this year, and the more I listen, the more I want to share it.

Listen in particular to the way Torres and Aisha Burns weave his voice and her violin together. It's rare and beautiful. Then there's the delicate percussion and bass that keep it all in motion. In addition to songs from his current record, we also get to hear an unreleased track, appropriately titled ""I Came To Sing The Song."" I'm thrilled he did.

eXs09v4vzio,Ta-ku & Wafia: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Cameron Robert | November 7, 2016 — The chemistry between Australian singer-producer Ta-ku and his fellow Aussie singer-songwriter Wafia becomes apparent the instant you hear their voices intertwined in song. On their first collaborative EP, (m)edian, they draw on their individual experiences to touch on subjects like compromise in relationships as they trade verses and harmonize over hollow melodies.

Ta-ku and Wafia live within the sonic landscape of artists like Drake or Bryson Tiller, but their style puts them in a world all their own. With production characterized by weary low-end rumbles and resonant keys, the two float above the music, playing off each other's harmonies. Fortunately for us at NPR, they took a moment to grace our Tiny Desk with a stripped-down, intimate performance of three songs from (m)edian.

69QYjqkAIwI,The Westerlies: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Tom Huizenga | November 2, 2016 - Calling themselves ""an accidental brass quartet,"" the members of The Westerlies, like the prevailing winds, blew east to New York from their hometown of Seattle, where they were childhood friends.

Young musicians today routinely resist being pigeonholed into a single genre. Such is the case with this unconventional band, which, through its compositions and tight ensemble playing, reveals a built-in sympathy for improvised jazz, rigorous classical structures and sunshiny pop. Trumpeters Riley Mulherkar and Zubin Hensler and trombonists Andy Clausen and Willem de Koch can blow hard — after all, this is a brass band — but the surprise comes in their soft tones and subtle phrasing.

Clausen provides two tunes, beginning with ""New Berlin, New York,"" which sports a snappy theme, standing out like a bright tie on a smart suit. A scurrying pattern of interlocking notes furnishes the underlying fabric. His closing number, ""Rue Des Rosiers,"" conjures up the circus-like vibe of a Parisian street scene. A whimsical theme gradually coalesces from fragments and grows into a rollicking amusement. Between these two pieces, Hensler's ""Run On Down"" evokes the calm beauty of Washington's San Juan Islands, north of the band's former home base.

The quartet has just released its ambitious second record, a double album of mostly original compositions. With The Westerlies' open ears and confident musicianship, it will be fascinating to see which direction the band blows next.

TeDh-3IKwgc,Joseph: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | October 28, 2016 - My first experience seeing Joseph was in 2014 as an opening act in New York City. It was just the twins Meegan and Allison Closner and their older sister, Natalie Closner, and it was clear then they had something special. Over these two years, Joseph's sound has grown beyond the Closners' harmonies. Now, you're likely to see them with a band or hear songs from their latest record, which is filled with sounds far beyond voice and acoustic guitar.

It's been a treat to witness Joseph's journey, but I was also fairly thrilled that for their Tiny Desk the sisters stripped it down to their original setup: three voices and one guitar. It's those essentials that will likely remain their strength, and hearing these songs from I'm Alone, No You're Not outside a studio setting felt not necessarily better, but certainly friendlier. Now that this band has 5 million listens (and that's only counting one song on Spotify), my guess is you may have missed this earlier sound. Here's a chance to hear the songs you love the way they could have been.

ewLgmWXQsqU,Drive-By Truckers: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"In music, we can escape the cruelties of the world or face them. There's no wrong way about it, but recently the members of Drive-By Truckers, a band that's long toed the line between a good time and a hard look at life, found they could no longer work purely in metaphor. American Band holds a direct mirror to a set of realities in this country with the same grace and rough-hewn wisdom that's guided the band all along. But in this compulsion to speak to the right now, there is an anger behind these songs never heard before.

In an emotional performance at the NPR offices, Patterson Hood's gravelly voice — capable of the quietest coos and the loudest hellraising — finds a new space, one that's shaken and vulnerable. He sings both ""Guns Of Umpqua"" and ""What It Means,"" songs not just about gun violence, but about the persons it affects: The former is about the horrific shooting at Umpqua Community College in rural Oregon last year, and the latter about the killing of young black men like Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin. Before performing ""What It Means,"" Hood tells the audience, ""I wrote this song a couple years ago. I'd honestly be really happy if it was just outdated and something we could leave in the past, but that's certainly not the case right now.""

Mike Cooley closes the set with ""Once They Banned Imagine,"" a quiet country song ""about things staying the same, and not necessarily in a good way,"" he says. That theme runs throughout Drive-By Truckers' catalog almost by necessity — by virtue of their being a rock band from the South, but also a rock band from America.

xIZR52eKgUA,Blind Pilot: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Blind Pilot and the Tiny Desk series both launched in the same year, 2008, so it's hard to comprehend how the two hadn't converged until now: The band's shimmery folk-pop sound, with its vibraphone and overarching vibrancy, is perfectly suited to the space behind Bob Boilen's desk.

Fortunately, that sound has bloomed considerably since Blind Pilot's beginnings, coinciding with the group's expansion from a duo to a sextet. It's certainly expansive enough to fill the air in this graceful performance of four songs from And Then Like Lions, on which singer Israel Nebeker issues a series of elegant, thoughtful reflections on how we interact with the past. The album's arrangements are incredibly rich, but they're also a perfect match for the organic, sonically uncluttered setting the Tiny Desk was designed to provide.

oE9T-ubu45Y,Billy Bragg & Joe Henry: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Earlier this year, Billy Bragg and Joe Henry set off on a journey. They boarded a train in Chicago, bound for Los Angeles. Each time the train stopped for more than 20 minutes in cities like St. Louis and San Antonio, they'd grab their guitars, hop off, find the waiting room and record an old railroad song. The result of this journey is an album called Shine A Light: Field Recordings From The Great American Railroad.

Bragg has been weaving folk and punk with protest music since the late '70s, when he first started busking around London. You can hear his passion for American songwriters such as Woody Guthrie and Lead Belly on this record. Henry is an American singer and songwriter with 13 albums of his own. He's also produced so many great records for others, including Rodney Crowell, Lisa Hannigan, Bonnie Raitt — and Bragg himself.

This concept record could be seen as a nostalgia trip, but both Bragg and Henry will emphatically say that it's not. These songs and this journey celebrate the modern railroad as a major economic engine and a still-vital form of transportation. The songs are filled with mythic poetry and the metaphoric romance inherent in train songs, but the vitality in the performances keeps the songs current. You can hear that behind my desk as well as you might in a rail station.

oVVGZd2oH7Y,RDGLDGRN: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"How do you pronounce RDGLDGRN? Easy, it's just Red Gold Green. Clean and simple, no vowels, no fluff — just like the band's music. Listen and you'll hear a striking mix of rock, hip-hop, funk, go-go and international sounds, fused with energy and humor.

RDGLDGRN is based in the D.C. suburb of Reston, Va. Local music fans know the band well, and have enjoyed watching it win fans across the country and around the world. A few years ago, I heard its first album (Red, Gold, Green) and fell in love with RDGLDGRN's style. It's not only because Dave Grohl played drums in most of the songs, while Pharrell Williams cowrote and co-produced ""Doing The Most."" I loved the group's fresh sound, and how its members rapped over the top of real drums. Their catchy hooks and harmonies quickly grabbed my attention.

When planning for RDGLDGRN's Tiny Desk show, many details were up for consideration: time, date, technical arrangements, and so on. Of biggest concern, though, was how the group would fit into the scaled-down setting of our space. If you go to a RDGLDGRN show, you'll see a traditional stage set-up with a full complement of instruments. In the venue, you can hear and feel the excitement of a full-blown band and a full drum set; heads bob, hands wave, bodies move, and you don't find a single person in the audience standing still. It wouldn't be easy to contain the energy in such a small space.

The colors in the band's name represent RDGLDGRN's members: Red (Marcus Parham), Green (Pierre Desrosiers) and Gold (Andrei Busuioceanu), who wear their respective colors all the time, even when offstage or away from the camera. In light of their recent experimentation with Brazilian-style percussion over acoustic versions of their songs, they decided that an all-acoustic set infused with Brazilian vibes would make for the perfect Tiny Desk concert. After performing ""Karnival,"" the group's latest single, RDGLDGRN treated us to unplugged versions of a handful of its best-known songs.

""Karnival"" is available now:

SjsziZFxupM,Haley Bonar: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"October 11, 2016 by Stephen Thompson • The first time I saw Haley Bonar in concert, she and her band were performing at the base of a 54-foot Doritos vending machine — a dehumanizing corporate venue of the variety that occasionally surfaces at SXSW. Somehow, though, her wry, spiky spark found a way to shine through.

A few years later, we found a slightly cozier spot for Bonar to perform three new songs, all drawn from the Minnesotan's terrific new album Impossible Dream. Along the way, she achieves an impressive range of sounds and storytelling, taking a little more than 10 minutes to pack in a melancholy look at the past's inescapability (""Hometown""), a brooding slow-burn about temptation and trust (""Jealous Girls""), and a stomping rager about doomed love (""Called You Queen""). All three achieve a nifty balance, sounding just stripped-down enough to suit the space, yet still immaculately polished at every turn.

2AChGszRGwI,Common At The White House: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"October 4, 2016 by BOB BOILEN • We've never done a Tiny Desk Concert that wasn't behind my desk at NPR. But when the White House called and said they were putting on an event called South by South Lawn, a day-long festival filled with innovators and creators from the worlds of technology and art, including music, we jumped at the chance to get involved. We chose Common as the performer and the White House library as the space.

This Tiny Desk Concert was a convergence of art and soul, mixing politics with heart. Common's choice of songs dealt with incarceration as the new slavery, imagined a time where women rule the world and honored the man he looked up to all his life, his father. For this occasion Common put together a special six-piece band of close friends that includes the great Robert Glasper, with his eloquent and delicate touch, on keyboards and Derrick Hodge, whose music spans from hip-hop to folk and has made a big imprint on the world of jazz, on bass. Common also asked his longtime friend and collaborator Bilal to sing on two songs. The performance includes three brand new songs, along with one classic, ""I Used To Love H.E.R.""

Common was born on Chicago's South Side and grew up in President Obama's city. His rap career began in the early 1990s, back when he was known as Common Sense, and he's always taken on big ideas without easy answers in his songs, from abortion to social justice to the legacy of hip-hop itself. 25 years later, morality and responsibility continue to play significant roles in his songs. In 2015, he won an Academy Award alongside the singer John Legend for their song ""Glory"" from the movie Selma.

Common told us that he'd been invited to the White House many times before, including by Michelle Obama for a poetry reading back in 2011, but he was thrilled by the prospect of performing his music during Barack Obama's final months as president. One look at this Tiny Desk Concert and you'll see that thrill on his face and hear it throughout this magnificent performance on this very special day.

Common will release his 11th studio album, Black America Again, in November.

Set List:
""I Used To Love H.E.R.""
""Letter To The Free""
""The Day The Women Took Over""
""Little Chicago Boy""

vArST0dVOl4,Joshua Bell & Jeremy Denk: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"September 30, 2016 by TOM HUIZENGA • ""You gotta love Brahms,"" Joshua Bell says, a little short of breath. He's wiping sweat from his brow after the big rock 'n' roll conclusion to the composer's D minor Violin Sonata. Bell and the astute pianist Jeremy Denk play it with all the turbulence and tenderness Brahms demands, and it's an invigorating way to open this Tiny Desk concert.

Bell and Denk have been chamber-music partners for 10 years, and they're a bit wound up on Brahms these days. They've released a new album, For the Love of Brahms, and they're performing the music, along with that of Brahms' friend Robert Schumann, in concerts.

Contrasting with the fiery Brahms, Schumann's Romance, Op. 94, No. 2 unfolds like a song without words. Bell makes his 1713 Stradivarius sing, capturing the bittersweet tone of the music. When the theme comes around for the second time, he lightens bow pressure for a more intimate, almost whispered disclosure.

Another of Brahms' close friends figures prominently in Bell and Denk's final offering. Violinist Joseph Joachim was something like the Joshua Bell of Brahms' day, as well as the man for whom the composer wrote his Violin Concerto. Joachim's gift to Brahms was creating piano and violin arrangements of the composer's Hungarian Dances.

Brahms' Hungarian Dance No. 1, powered by a sweeping theme and chugging piano topped with pearly descending runs, whisks you to a smoky café where gypsy fiddlers battle for supremacy. Starting off on the low G string, Bell's tone is as rich as dark chocolate, the feeling a touch wistful.

Bell and Denk are among today's most thoughtful and probing musicians. With playing as vibrant as this, it's virtually impossible not to love Brahms.

qTJfITfbYNA,Blue Man Group: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"September 26, 2016 by BOB BOILEN • They came, they measured, and they returned to perform a show like no other. It was the great NPR Tiny Desk Takeover by Blue Man Group.

If you've not seen this performance ensemble and their production in New York, Las Vegas, Orlando, Boston, Chicago or Berlin, then you've missed a night of magical fun. These Blue Men may never say a word, but the performances make for poignant looks at who we are as humans. They also make unusual music on instruments of their own design.

Josh Rogosin, our engineer for the Tiny Desk, first saw them in their early days, some 25 years ago at New York's Astor Place Theatre. He told me how the Blue Men would retrofit some of their theatrical magic — including their custom-made instruments, confetti cannons and streamers — to fit this small desk space.

Every band that plays the Tiny Desk must work within the restrictions of the space. So instead of installing their entire signature PVC instrument, what ended up behind the desk was about a third of it. On the right side of the desk, their Shred Mill makes its internet debut: It's a drum machine triggered by magnets that changes rhythm depending where they are placed on the home-made variable-speed conveyor belt. They also invented something called a Spinulum, whose rhythmic tempo is controlled by rotating a wheel that plucks steel guitar strings. (You can read a full description on the instruments below.)

In the end the Blue Men and their dressed-down accompanists performed a Tiny Desk concert like no other. I've been familiar with their music since my days as director of All Things Considered in the 1990s, when I would play their tunes between news stories. Seeing all this come to life (and I know this is true for Josh, as well) was simply unforgettable. From the unique sounds of the PVC to the strumming sounds of the Spinulum to their ""Meditation For Winners"" mantras, you'll get a taste of why this troupe's art is so universal and so much fun.

THE INSTRUMENTS

(as told to us by the Blue Man Group)

Chapman Stick: A combination of a guitar, a bass guitar, and a washboard, the Chapman Stick is 10 strings and all neck. While it can be played with fingers, we often bow the Stick with a bass string. This method, pioneered by Blue Man Group, is called the Mandelbrot Stick Technique.

Cimbalom: An old hammered chromatic string instrument from Hungary that we gave a plywood update to. It's normally played gently with soft mallets, but Blue Man Group hits it aggressively with drumsticks.

Shredmill: Making its internet debut, this new Blue Man Group creation is a treadmill-shaped, electro-mechanical sequencer that a Blue Man (or anyone else) can use to create rhythmic patterns. Placing and/or moving the Shred Mill's tiny little magnets in order to change the sequence (""shredding"") is dangerously addictive. If you are ever presented with the opportunity to shred, proceed at your own risk.

Spinulum: Have you ever watched Wheel of Fortune and thought to yourself, ""I wonder what would happen if I took that wheel, shrunk it down to about a foot in diameter, mounted it to a stand, and replaced that little white flipper with steel guitar strings?"" Us too! The Spinulum is a brand new Blue Man Group instrument that is part slide guitar, part bicycle wheel, and 100 percent dynamite!

PVC: Blue Man Group's signature instrument is comprised of several lengths of polyvinyl chloride pipe that make an almost synthesizer-like sound when struck with a closed-cell foam rubber paddle. This performance only includes the center, high-octave section of the PVC. This is not because we have a problem with the other sections of the PVC. We actually really like them. There just wasn't enough space. It's a tiny desk.

MIDI PVC: The signature Blue Man Group PVC instrument shrunk down and electrified.

""Vortex""
""The Forge""
""Meditation For Winners""

h--fvyPu5e4,Corinne Bailey Rae: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"September 19, 2016 by BOB BOILEN • It's been six years since Grammy-winning singer-songwriter Corinne Bailey Rae released her second album, The Sea, so this Tiny Desk concert feels like both a re-introduction and a welcome back. The Sea dealt with the sudden death of her husband, saxophonist Jason Rae; since then, she's married producer Steve Brown, and together they've made a new record called The Heart Speaks In Whispers. That album has this English singer recording with the likes of Esperanza Spalding, Marcus Miller and members of the band KING.

There's real joy in this genre-defying performance — just great songs and a unique voice. It's a treat for new fans and old friends alike.

eXfVIPqcF9I,Saul Williams: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"September 16, 2016 by BOB BOILEN • In terms of sheer intensity, Saul Williams' Tiny Desk concert may be the most potent in our eight-year history. Only Kate Tempest comes to mind as its equal, which makes sense given that both mix music with bracing, truthful poetry. In Williams' opening song — ""Burundi,"" from his album MartyrLoserKing — the main character is a computer hacker who lives in Burundi and fights for democracy:

Question your authority, genocide and poverty
Treaties don't negate the fact you're dealing stolen property
Hacker, I'm a hacker, I'm a hacker in your hard drive
Hundred thousand dollar Tesla ripping through your hard drive

Accompanied by two acoustic guitars as they pound out a beat, Williams became ever more animated, riled and firm. Then, ""Think Like They Book Say"" paid homage to Chelsea Manning, the soldier serving a prison sentence for leaking classified information to WikiLeaks. To close out the set, Williams cradled my James Brown doll and issued a powerful, somewhat off-the-cuff version of ""Down For Some Ignorance."" It brought him to tears, and you could feel his passion in every word — sharp, thoughtful, deeply powerful and utterly provocative.

NsEQbJGZcbM,The Secret Sisters: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"September 12, 2016 by NICK MICHAEL • Lydia and Laura Rogers are recognizable as sisters the minute they open their mouths. They float, twist and trade harmonies in ways only siblings can. Hailing from small-town Alabama, the pair started practicing parts as girls in church, and two decades later, their music can be hymn-like: plain but powerful, heartsick and hopeful.

They also throw back to secular songs: those of the Everly Brothers, bluegrass creator Bill Monroe and country godfather Hank Williams. In fact, all but two songs on The Secret Sisters' first (self-titled) album were covers of traditionals or traditional country songs. On their second album, Put Your Needle Down, the Rogers sisters wrote more songs themselves and brought a tinge of darkness, especially in standout tracks like ""Bad Habit"" and ""Iuka.""

Now chipping away at their third album, the sisters are still mining their Alabama roots. In this performance, you'll hear an unreleased river ballad (""Tennessee River Runs Low""), some old-fashioned loneliness (""You've Got It Wrong"") and one of the few minor hymns in the church songbook (""Flee As a Bird"").

vXUznxv0qF0,William Bell: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"September 6, 2016 by RACHEL HORN • When we invited William Bell to the Tiny Desk, we looked forward to witnessing part of a veteran soul hitmaker's journey back to the spotlight. Bell is known for writing and performing several of the R&B classics that emerged from Memphis' Stax Records in the 1960s, ""You Don't Miss Your Water"" and ""Everybody Loves A Winner"" among them. After decades away from Stax — and away from sizable record labels entirely — he returned to his old label home earlier this year to release This Is Where I Live. So we were ready to be won over by Bell's rich, expressive voice and bandleader's charm; we were prepared for emotionally dense songs that say a lot in only a few words. We just didn't expect so much yellow.

Bell, who's 77 and now makes his home in Atlanta, worked suavely through two new songs from This Is Where I Live. The title track follows an autobiographical structure common among soul singers of a certain age (see: Sharon Jones, Charles Bradley, Aaron Neville). It narrates the story of Bell's life in specific detail, from the first time he heard Sam Cooke to the memorable hotel stay when he wrote ""You Don't Miss Your Water,"" the song that ""took [him] all around the world."" And ""The Three Of Me"" is a love song of measured regret, typical of earlier Bell ballads but for its patina of time-worn wisdom.

To close his performance, Bell led the Total Package Band through one of the most enduring songs he's written: the blues standard ""Born Under A Bad Sign,"" which has been covered by folks like Cream and Koko Taylor since Albert King first recorded it in 1967. When Bell's co-writer on the song, Booker T. Jones, played it at the Tiny Desk in 2011, his solo organ work lent the tune an appropriately eerie cast. For Bell and company, though, ""Bad Sign"" became a joyous, communal celebration. Nearly every member of the 12-piece band took a chorus before settling into an energetic vamp, their leader's grin as bright as his band's T-shirts.

D0E5vMkDfOI,Big Thief: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"August 29, 2016 by BOB BOILEN • The power of Big Thief lies in the stunning voice of Adrianne Lenker — as well as the band's intense rhythms, the guitar playing of Buck Meek and, right, the lyrics. Come to think of it, everything this band does serves the muscular warmth of these brilliant songs, which are not only memorable, but meaningful.

""Masterpiece"" is the first song in this Tiny Desk Concert, as well as Big Thief's best-known tune. It's a song of mortality and walking through life with your friends by your side. In fact, all three of these songs, all from the group's 2016 debut, are about passion, friendship, reflection, life and loved ones — it's music profound and beautiful enough to even work well in a brightly lit office in the middle of the day.

3q3z_KvLUNI,Nina Diaz: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"August 26, 2016 by FELIX CONTRERAS • When I first saw Nina Diaz back in 2010, she was fronting a punk trio from San Antonio called Girl In A Coma. She and the band sounded ferocious, with an unmistakable spirit of fun — for proof, here's their Tiny Desk concert from a couple years later.

Now, Girl In A Coma has taken a short and temporary break so Diaz could work on the inevitable solo album — and it sounds as if the break has been good for everyone all around. The other two women in the band, Diaz's sister Phannie and their compadre Jenn Alva, continue to work on a variety of side projects and recordings. (Don't sleep on their new group and album, both of which are called Fea.)

As a solo artist, Diaz finds new ways to sound ferocious, this time via songs packed with the kind of subtleties that come with a bit of age and wisdom. Her new album is due out in the fall, but she's been out on the road with her new band as they figure out how to make the new material come alive on the stage.

Judging from what we saw behind Bob Boilen's desk recently, it seems they've gotten comfortable with the music, and with Diaz's newfound status as a solo singer-songwriter.

uxglzsJkBJg,Margaret Glaspy: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"August 22, 2016 by BOB BOILEN • There's brutal honesty in the songs of Margaret Glaspy that can make them feel cold, but they're also heartfelt. That's part of what makes Glaspy a top new artist of 2016 for many of the writers here at NPR Music.

Glaspy's new album Emotions And Math, made with her band, is a huge leap from her earlier EPs Homeschool (2012) and If & When (2013), which mostly consisted of the singer and her electric guitar. You can hear Glaspy's sharp words on those older records, but now that wit and wisdom packs a confident punch — as does her guitar playing, which is no longer simply fingerpicked, but also crunched with power chords behind a newly brazen voice.

The Tiny Desk concert provides a great example of how much power can be found in simplicity and purity. Everything serves the songs here: There's no overplaying, no frills, just great music and a tremendous new artist who sounds thrilled to be playing it.

oUGukMLPQJs,Eddie Palmieri: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"August 19, 2016 by SURAYA MOHAMED • Different Tiny Desk performers pop up in NPR Music's workspace just about every week, and frequently more often than that. While every artist is special, it's rare to have a true legend come through.

Eddie Palmieri is that once-in-a-lifetime musician, bandleader, composer and arranger. An icon for both modern and Latin jazz, he continues to break tradition and innovate within many musical styles, including salsa, fusion, Latin funk and more.

His parents were born in Puerto Rico and later moved to New York City; Eddie Palmieri was born in Spanish Harlem and grew up in the Bronx with a large family that nurtured his musical talent. He studied classical piano when he was young and gave a piano recital at Carnegie Hall when he was just 11. But all he wanted to do at that time was play the drums. When he was 13, he joined his uncle's orchestra to play timbales. He later gave up the drums and started playing piano in the early 1950s in various Latin dance bands, working with Eddie Forrester, Johnny Segui and the popular Tito Rodriguez Orchestra. You can hear his continued passion for the sticks in the percussive vamps that pervade his discography.

Recorded in 1962, Perfecta was the first of nearly 50 albums Eddie Palmieri has released. The Sun Of Latin Music, a groundbreaking album released in 1975, won him the first-ever Grammy for Best Latin Recording. He later went on to win nine more Grammys, along with a host of other prestigious honors.

It was an honor to have Eddie Palmieri perform at the Tiny Desk in a special, intimate setting — without his usual big-band accompaniment. We get close enough to hear him growl; you can check out the iconic sound he's been making since his early recordings. He's said it's his inner spirit coming out to help him play. The first composition here, ""Iraida,"" was written for his wife, who died several years ago. The second, ""The Persian Scale,"" is a rare treat — a tune you won't find on any of his recordings. The set closes with ""La Libertad,"" a statement on social justice and poverty from the classic Vamonos Pa'l Monte album, released in the early '70s. Even without the band, the audience clapped and danced as the musician played his freeform dance music, deeply rooted in beautiful yet simple chord changes and his signature Afro-Cuban rhythmic style.

August 15, 2016 by BOBBY CARTER • Good luck trying to classify Anderson .Paak and his band The Free Nationals. Much of their sound is layered atop a soulful hip-hop foundation; from there, your safest bet is to call it a hodgepodge of genres in the best way possible. Guitarist Jose Rios and bassist Kelsey Gonzalez inject a hard-rock edge into the Hi-Tek-produced ""Come Down,"" this set's opening number. When you hear them play the first few jazz chords of ""Heart Don't Stand A Chance,"" it's hard to simply call this R&B.

It's been a slow build for .Paak, who released a few mixtapes before his 2014 debut album Venice. This year has marked his official breakout with Malibu, on which he did what so many in his position fail to do: He capitalized. After bursting into the spotlight with his appearances on Dr. Dre's Compton LP, he immediately prepped the release of Malibu. The album sculpted an entirely new lane for Anderson .Paak. He can rhyme with best of 'em, and his vocal styling, reminiscent of '70s and '80s greats, is invigorating when set against today's tender R&B elite. Before all that, he's a drummer-slash-bandleader.

I've experienced three separate presentations of this band. First, there's the recorded version, on which .Paak collaborates with some of hip-hop's finest producers. Then, their tight stage show hits you in the chest with 90-plus minutes of pure energy. In the midst of a whirlwind tour, they stopped by the Tiny Desk and reworked three cuts from Malibu, along with an audience request that shocked even them. They stripped down and pulled back just enough to fill the room.

XnNCJI_LUhg,René Marie: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"July 27, 2016 by PATRICK JARENWATTANANON • The Colorado River — better known for running through majestic National Parks and powering hydroelectric dams — forms an unlikely backdrop for the creation of a jazz song. But René Marie was answering phones at Denver's jazz radio station KUVO when she sat down across from a fellow volunteer fundraiser. He would soon invite her on a canoeing trip and, without yet having seen the eponymous river, she wrote the giddy ""Colorado River Song"" on the way there.

René Marie's is the sort of voice which first comes to mind when someone asks for a jazz singer — big and expressive, at home in classic swinging settings and comfortable in crowds. There's plenty to set her apart, though. She made her first recording in her early 40s, so she's a late bloomer by any standard. Her tastes admit many influences, and she's got a penchant for original songwriting, especially where social justice intersects with personal biography. Her folky story-song ""This Is (Not) A Protest Song"" addresses homelessness and mental illness even in her own family.

Joined by her Experiment In Truth band (John Chin on piano, Elias Bailey on bass, Quentin Baxter on drums), Marie visited NPR headquarters to play songs from her new album Sound Of Red. She never specified the exact nature of that synesthetic idea, though the title track would seem to indicate that it's about the addictive and lusty blood-rush of performing — of seeing red while singing the blues. In the audience was the bold KUVO volunteer from that day 10 years ago. His name is Jesse, and they're now married and live in her home state of Virginia; they drove up together for this Tiny Desk concert.

Q5XmnmEyaKQ,The Jayhawks: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"August 8, 2016 by TOM HUIZENGA • The last song in this set from The Jayhawks is called ""Comeback Kids."" Although it's ostensibly a breezy portrait of a lovers' reunion, the title could be the motto for a band that's been through so many breakups, re-formations and personnel changes in the past 30 years that Wikipedia resorted to an infographic timeline to capture the myriad details.

Yet the essential Jayhawks sound — jangly, country-tinged rock with exquisitely crafted hooks and close harmonies — remains solid, due largely to founding member Gary Louris, who continues to dominate the singing and songwriting. The band's new album Paging Mr. Proust, from which they chose four songs for this Tiny Desk concert, sounds like vintage Jayhawks.

""Quiet Corners & Empty Spaces,"" with its carefree, sing-along chorus, may sound lightweight, but it's actually a plea to live more in the moment (""In the end, there's no waiting redemption""). It could fit perfectly into the lineup on Rainy Day Music, the band's impeccable 2003 album.

Summer heat is palpable in ""Lovers Of The Sun."" The dreamy, '60s-tinged number is all California laid-back — but also brushed with a tint of melancholy, thanks in part to the colors that guitarist Kraig Johnson conjures with his EBow. With its silken harmonies, the song is reminiscent of tracks like ""It's Up To You"" from The Jayhawks' 1997 album Sound Of Lies.

Although ""Leaving The Monsters Behind"" was collaboratively written by most of the band members, one can't help making a direct connection to Louris, who has been frank about his recent, and successful, stint in rehab for opiate addiction. Again, a jaunty refrain, delivered in polished three-part harmony, belies darker lyrics: ""If I move fast, maybe I'll outrun my past."" The song could also be just another reflection of the ups and downs of a beloved band whose singular career began in Minneapolis in 1985. In any case, The Jayhawks has outrun the past and steps into a fourth decade sounding vital as ever.

gSZzJu67EJc,Rachel Barton Pine: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"July 27, 2016 by TOM HUIZENGA • The music of Johann Sebastian Bach is essential, like air and water, for many classical musicians. Pianist András Schiff starts every day with Bach — sometimes before breakfast. ""It's like taking care of your inner hygiene. There's something very pure about it,"" he says. Cellist Matt Haimovitz notes that he's been playing and thinking about the Bach Cello Suites for more than 30 years. He even plays them in bars.

Violinist Rachel Barton Pine began playing Bach in church at age 4. Ever since, she's been mastering and re-mastering Bach's set of six Sonatas and Partitas—more than two hours of solo violin music that looms like a proverbial Mount Everest for any serious fiddler. The trick is getting the details down. Bach left us with the notes but not much else. Pine recently analyzed every measure of these works, and prepared a new edition of the music with her own dynamic markings, phrasing indications, bowings and fingerings.

For this performance, Pine chose three contrasting movements from the set and plays them on her Guarneri del Gesu violin, which was built in 1742 — eight years before Bach died. She highlights the spirit of the dance in the ""Tempo di Borea"" (a Bourée from the First Partita). She unfolds a serene melody, just lightly accompanied, in the ""Largo"" (from the Third Sonata), and she closes with the intertwining ""Fuga"" (from the First Sonata), which sounds like three violinists in deep discussion.

Although the Sonatas and Partitas brim with technical demands, Pine says that every time she plays them, it's as if she's ""conversing with the very best of friends.""

AKOlC7TAQ80,Kevin Morby: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"August 1, 2016 by BOB BOILEN • The music of Kevin Morby is fairly straightforward and acoustic for the most part, with traditional, folk-based rock at its core. The mystery and intensity lies in the lyrics. His biting song ""I Have Been To The Mountain,"" performed here at the Tiny Desk and on his 2016 album Singing Saw, was inspired by the 2014 chokehold death of Eric Garner at the hands of a New York City police officer.

That man lived in this town
Till that pig took him down
And have you heard the sound
Of a man stop breathing, pleading?

In this set, Meg Duffy's guitar provides a strong example of the care and craft that goes into these songs — and there's even more of that on Singing Saw, the album that finally hooked me on Morby's music even after good records he'd made with the bands Woods and The Babies, as well as two other solo albums. If you're a latecomer like me, dig in here. If you're already a convert, you'll likely love the clarity of these songs and their stark arrangements.

xLFeeOVrNlI,Lucy Dacus: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"July 29, 2016 by BOB BOILEN • For Lucy Dacus, a 21-year-old with a warm and deep voice, singing comes as naturally as talking. As an adopted child in Richmond, Va., she was raised by a piano-playing mother; now, she writes songs that can be thoughtful, playful and powerful, with tremendous arrangements from guitarist Jacob Blizard.

Dacus and Blizard have been working together since Blizard asked her to be part of a college project he was working on; now, on the strength of her current album No Burden, they've just signed to Matador Records. So consider this Tiny Desk concert a taste of the talent we'll be celebrating for years to come.

4KbPdFZ24F4,Xenia Rubinos: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"July 25, 2016 by FELIX CONTRERAS • Xenia Rubinos has learned a valuable lesson — ""You have to know where you come from to know where you're going"" — and applied it to her remarkable music. Rubinos' work contains traces of her Afro-Caribbean roots, but when she and her band do things like use two bassists to play a counter-melody in her song ""Lonely Lover,"" they defy classification.

That's what brings me to her music: the surprises, like the unexpected change-ups she brings to the way voices are presented. It all sounds heady, even heavy, but underneath it all, she and her band lay down serious grooves designed to move both your body and your intellect.

DouAiv06tMY,John Congleton And The Nighty Nite: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"July 22, 2016 by BOB BOILEN • Listening to John Congleton can be scary. The imagery — of ""blood between my legs,"" of loving another ""like a lion loves its kill"" — can be horrifying. But the songs Congleton sings (from his album Until The Horror Goes) touch on what it means to be human, and what it means to face the fact that we are flesh-and-blood ""temporary custodians"" in vessels that will inevitably return to the earth and decay.

These are not songs to shock, but songs to remind us of our fragility, our faults, our instincts and what an extraordinary thing it is to be an ordinary phenomenal nothing — simply particles that unite and make us who we are for our brief time on earth.

Congleton has been on my radar for a long time: He's been my favorite producer and engineer, working on records by St. Vincent, Angel Olsen, Spoon, David Byrne, The Mountain Goats, The Walkmen and many others. Here, he creates haunting tension with just acoustic guitar, brilliant electronics from Jordan Geiger (Hospital Ships), and words passionately sung. This Tiny Desk set is a fine, albeit spare, introduction to a brilliant artist. If you find his take on humanity enlightening and humble, the way I do, give Until The Horror Goes a listen. There's nothing else quite like it.

sNJUzwBNbxo,Gregory Porter: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"July 18, 2016 by BOB BOILEN • Gregory Porter's healing soul music sends a message of compassion, and he's got a baritone voice that resonates love. When Porter visited NPR, we'd just learned that our colleague, photojournalist David Gilkey, had been killed while working on a story for NPR in Afghanistan. When Porter began singing the calmly beautiful ""No Love Dying,"" he may not have known how much it would mean to us. Yet this song of compassion and hope, from his Grammy-winning 2013 album Liquid Spirit, was just what we'd needed.

Porter and pianist Chip Crawford continued their thoughtful, entrancing set with ""Take Me To The Alley"" (the title track to Porter's new album), a song about how we treat and think about those who live on society's margins. Closing this Tiny Desk concert is ""Don't Be A Fool,"" another new song of love, loyalty and trust. For us, Porter's set provided a timely reminder that we can all use comfort, counsel and guidance — and that music can be serious and heartwarming without losing its sense of wonder and delight.

ZHbkzeVym_0,Chris Forsyth & The Solar Motel Band: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"July 15, 2016 by LARS GOTRICH • There's a point when a jam is just a jam, and when a jam becomes a journey... man. Ever since Chris Forsyth started The Solar Motel Band to fill out his long-form rock compositions, the Philly guitarist has proven his versatility not only as an instrumentalist, but also as a storyteller.

Onstage, The Solar Motel Band opts for maximum-volume, high-energy rock 'n' roll — even low-key numbers are massive in their movement. In the NPR Music offices, where amp stacks could rattle books off the shelves, Forsyth culls a set from The Rarity Of Experience that plays to the room and speaks to the malleability of his work. The sparkling ""Harmonious Dance"" meditates on a gently unfolding melody shared between Forsyth and guitarist Nick Millevoi. Due to touring conflicts, The Solar Motel Band's rhythm section is different here than on record, but bassist Matt Stein provides a grounding force, as drummer Ryan Jewell — a heavy in the Columbus, Ohio, avant-jazz/improv scene for the past decade and change — loosens the very ground beneath it all. It's a dynamic that works to the band's advantage, helping to churn and turn these songs into new forms, like shifting plates beneath the Earth that disrupt and correct themselves.

The Solar Motel Band closes this set with a twofer. First, there's the dubby and rumbling ""The First Ten Minutes Of C********* Blues"" (a nod to the unreleased Rolling Stones documentary directed by Robert Frank), where Millevoi bends and whammies the strings of his Fender into the dirt. But just as we crawl out from the grime, a buzzing drone segues into ""Boston Street Lullaby,"" an understated and quiet tune with disquieting moments — a disarming journey worth taking.

2yxU-_md2hE,Jane Bunnett and Maqueque: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"July 12, 2016 by FELIX CONTRERAS • Jane Bunnett knows a few things about Cuban music. She and her husband, trumpeter Larry Kramer, have been traveling to the island from their home base of Toronto for more than 30 years. They've collaborated with musicians there, as well as back home in Canada and on tours around the globe.

So it should come as no surprise that when Bunnett chose to perform with some of the top young women musicians from the island, she'd choose some of the best of their generation. As you can sense from this video, the members of Maqueque are conservatory-trained, but also schooled in Afro-Cuban tradition.

If you want to hear what Cuba sounds like today, then be sure to listen. It's a pleasure to watch and listen as Jane Bunnett and Maqueque share their passion with the world.

T3dkJZS3n9A,Valley Queen: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"July 8, 2016 by BOB BOILEN • At first it was simply the voice that shook me. I was in Austin, Texas, during SXSW, and my buddy Sean Moeller of Daytrotter told me he was recording a new favorite band and I should come by. The house/makeshift studio on Austin's East Side was saturated with the alluring voice of Natalie Carol and her solid yet rattling Neil Young-ish band. That was my introduction to Valley Queen, and I've seen them shake the walls at a few venues around the country now, one of which was here at NPR. When this band, which has only put out a few singles on Bandcamp so far, came to the Tiny Desk, its members played like veterans. Valley Queen's music is rich with nuance and depth, rooted deep in California country. They are working toward that debut record, and three songs they played at the Tiny Desk were unreleased. Here is an early glimpse of some growing talent.

bWdZP2Qj6wA,Los Hacheros: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"June 30, 2016 by FELIX CONTRERAS • Sometimes it's necessary to get back to basics. In the case of Los Hacheros, that means returning to the deep groove of Afro-Caribbean music that provides the source material for modern salsa and all of its permutations.

As you'll see in this video, the band's dedication to authenticity is masterfully executed with a serious dose of sabor. In fact, the band was so swinging, it was impossible to sit on the sidelines and pass up my own chance to jump in during ""Bambulaye"" and perform with the band myself. So clear out the furniture and turn up the sound on this video to create your own dance party.

LaCjgtH4zac,Adia Victoria: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"June 30, 2016 by BOB BOILEN • At first, I was drawn in by Adia Victoria's languid guitar sound: In her hands, it practically has a drawl of its own. Then I heard her stories — never trite, often personal, always potent — which you can hear in the words that open her Tiny Desk concert. ""I don't know nothing 'bout Southern belles,"" she sings in ""Stuck In The South,"" adding, ""but I can tell you something 'bout Southern hell.""

Adia Victoria's voice is powerful and direct, with no artifice; it carries the singular perspective of a Southern black woman with a Seventh Day Adventist upbringing, who never felt like she'd fit in. She recently put out her first album, Beyond The Bloodhounds, and two of the songs here (""Stuck In The South"" and ""And Then You Die"") are from that record. It's a brilliant debut, though I highly recommend seeing her perform live for the full experience.

sKqnfdBfaEw,Charles Lloyd & Jason Moran: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"June 28, 2016 by FELIX CONTRERAS • Together, saxophonist Charles Lloyd and pianist Jason Moran make jazz that draws from the past while looking to the future. Lloyd's body of work stretches back to the mid-1960s, and has always shown a disregard for boundaries and cliches. He seems determined to work through the later part of his career with artistically and spiritually motivated playing that simply astounds.

Moran is the sound of today and tomorrow. You can hear reverence in his duo playing with Lloyd — and you may also notice playing that taps into Lloyd's ever-present youthful spirit. Together, their performance behind Bob Boilen's Tiny Desk was as refreshing and energizing as deep meditation.

pfPvgAtgTNM,Mashrou' Leila: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"June 24, 2016 by ANASTASIA TSIOULCAS • When we invited the band Mashrou' Leila to come play at the Tiny Desk, we couldn't have foreseen the timing.

The group arrived at our office the morning after the horrific June 12 shootings in Orlando at the gay nightclub Pulse. We were all collectively reeling from the news, and for this rock band from Beirut, Lebanon, the attack hung very heavily.

Mashrou' Leila is fronted by singer and lyricist Hamed Sinno, along with violinist Haig Papazian, keyboardist and guitarist Firas Abou Fakher, Ibrahim Badr on bass and drummer Carl Gerges: five young Beirutis whose family backgrounds reflect Lebanon's religious diversity.

Sinno is openly gay, and Mashrou' Leila is well acquainted with the targeting of LGBT people. The band has faced condemnation, bans and threats in its home region, including some from both Christian and Muslim sources, for what it calls ""our political and religious beliefs and endorsement of gender equality and sexual freedom."" And yet, when Mashrou' Leila performs in the U.S., its members are often tasked with representing the Middle East as a whole, being still one of the few Arab rock bands to book a North American tour.

After the attack on Pulse, the members of Mashrou' Leila decided to open their Tiny Desk set with ""Maghawir"" (Commandos), a song Sinno wrote in response to two nightclub shootings in Beirut — a tragic parallel to what happened in Orlando. In the Beirut incidents, which took place within a week of each other, two of the young victims were out celebrating their respective birthdays. ""Maghawir"" is a checklist of sorts about how to spend a birthday clubbing in the band's home city, but also a running commentary about machismo and the idea that big guns make big men.

""All the boys become men / Soldiers in the capital of the night,"" Sinno sings. ""Shoop, shoop, shot you down ... We were just all together, painting the town / Where'd you disappear?"" It was a terrible, and terribly fitting, response to the Florida shootings.

In all of its songs, Mashrou' Leila creates densely knotted wordplay; even the band's name has layers of meaning and resonance. The most common translation of ""Mashrou' Leila"" is ""The Night Project,"" which tips to the group's beginnings back in 2008 in sessions at the American University of Beirut. But Leila is also the name of the protagonist in one of Arabic literature's most famous tales, the tragic love story of Leila and Majnun, a couple somewhat akin to Romeo and Juliet. Considering Mashrou' Leila's hyper-literary bent, it's hard not to hear that evocation.

In the second song, ""Kalaam"" (S/He), Sinno dives deep into the relationships between language and gender, and how language shapes perception and identity: ""They wrote the country's borders upon my body, upon your body / In flesh-ligatured word / My word upon your word, as my body upon your body / Flesh-conjugated words."" (The band has posted its own full English translations of these songs online.)

The title of the third song in Mashrou' Leila's set, ""Djin,"" is a perfect distillation of that linguistic playfulness. In pre-Islamic Arabia and later in Islamic theology and texts, a djin (or jinn) is a supernatural creature; but here, Sinno also means gin, as in the alcoholic drink. ""Liver baptized in gin,"" Sinno sings, ""I dance to ward off the djin.""

But you don't have to speak a word of Arabic, or get Mashrou' Leila's cerebral references, to appreciate its songs: deeply layered, darkly textured and sonically innovative. And sometimes, as Sinno says, the band's songs ""are just about getting really messed up at a bar.""

2BZSvAsmMXg,Brandy Clark: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"June 20, 2016 by JACOB GANZ • There's no explicit narrative threading together Brandy Clark's second album, Big Day In A Small Town. Instead, the 11 interconnected songs map a small collection of streets, landmarks, loves, betrayals and heartbreaks that cohere into a place as particular and as universal as Winesburg or Grover's Corners.

Low-key and wry, Clark is a meticulous songwriter who made hits for Reba McEntire, Miranda Lambert, LeAnn Rimes and Kacey Musgraves before she put her own name on an album. (It's hard to believe that nobody wrote the instant-classic line, ""If you want the girl next door, then go next door,"" before she did.) But when Clark steps in front of a mic and turns on the charm, her humor pulls the audience right into every single joke — watch for the knowing smile she shoots guitarist Miles Aubrey just before she drops a bomb at the end of the first chorus of ""Daughter."" In anyone else's hands, that song might have been a bitter revenge fantasy, but Clark's gently swooping verses and puckered choruses sketch the bemused, from-the-front-porch distance of wronged party who knows that fate is likely to do more damage to a cad than a key would ever do to his car's glossy paint job.

""I really developed a love for small towns when my dad died and I went home for his memorial service, and there were so many people they had to have it in a gym,"" Clark said before introducing ""Since You've Gone To Heaven,"" the heartbreaker that closes Big Day. ""And that's not an uncommon thing in a small town, but anywhere else in the world, that only happens for a celebrity."" Clark's gift as a performer is making any room — even a newsroom on a cold, rainy spring afternoon — feel as warmly human.

bmWBDs-5z3c,Alessio Bax: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"June 17, 2016 by TOM HUIZENGA • The practice of lulling a child to sleep through music must be about the oldest tradition imaginable. All parents have wanted their children to sleep at some point, if only to have a little peace and quiet — and to plot strategies for getting their own shuteye.

Pianist Alessio Bax knows all about sleep — and lack thereof. He's a first-time parent, and his 22-month-old daughter Mila is, like any child that age, a handful, not to mention impossibly cute.

For Father's Day, we invited Bax and his daughter behind Bob Boilen's desk for a few lullabies from the award-winning pianist's recent album Lullabies For Mila. Sensing attention from the crowd and the cameras, Mila is anything but sleepy. On the contrary, with her own running commentary — and some fast fingering on a toy keyboard — she does her best to steal the show.

Bax begins with a rendition of J.S. Bach's ""Sheep May Safely Graze,"" explaining that the composer asks the performer to do three things at once, which is not unlike the duties a new parent must juggle. Mila's mom, Lucille Chung, joins her husband at the piano for a brief Brahms Waltz (Op. 39 in A-flat) often referred to as a lullaby. As if on cue, Mila eagerly introduces Chung with a sweet ""Mama, too."" Bax closes with a ravishing Prelude by Rachmaninoff. As the undulating music begins to heat up, Mila pounds away at her own mini-keyboard — that is, until Mom plucks the toy from her lap.

zWckUls1wVE,A Band From Beirut Speaks To Tragedy In Orlando,"June 15, 2016 — Monday morning, as we were all absorbing the horrors of the Pulse attack in Orlando — the deadliest mass public shooting in modern U.S. history — Mashrou' Leila arrived to play a Tiny Desk concert. For this band from Beirut, Lebanon, the full weight of the tragedy hung heavily, and its members wanted to begin their set by addressing the Pulse shootings. We'll have their full performance available soon, but this was so timely, we wanted to share it right away.

Mashrou' Leila (the name translates as ""Night Project"") includes five young Beirutis — singer Hamed Sinno, violinist Haig Papazian, keyboardist and guitarist Firas Abou Fakher, Ibrahim Badr on bass and drummer Carl Gerges — of mixed religious heritage. They are well acquainted with the targeting of both LGBT people and those questioning the political, religious and cultural status quo.

Sinno, who is also the band's lyricist, is openly gay, and Mashrou' Leila has faced condemnation, bans and threats in its home region, including some from both Christian and Muslim sources. The group's sound is beautifully layered, with vocals that allude to the Arab tradition of ornamenting melodies, but is also fresh, modern and compelling. Sinno's nuanced lyrics run deep.

The group opened its Tiny Desk set with ""Maghawir"" (Commandos), a song Sinno wrote in response to two nightclub shootings in Beirut — a tragic parallel to what happened in Orlando. In the Beirut shootings, which took place within a week of each other, two of the young victims were out celebrating their respective birthdays. So ""Maghawir"" is a wry checklist of sorts about how to spend a birthday clubbing in their home city, but also a running commentary about machismo and the idea that big guns make big men.

""All the boys become men / Soldiers in the capital of the night,"" Sinno sings. ""Shoop, shoop, shot you down ... We were just all together, painting the town / Where'd you disappear?""

15IHNYq6stw,Chick Corea & Gary Burton: Tiny Desk Concert,"June 13, 2016 by SURAYA MOHAMED • Sometimes big-name artists need special attention. But in this case, it wasn't because they've been jazz pioneers and innovators since the 1960s and are considered to be founding fathers of jazz fusion, not to mention two of the most important jazz figures performing today. It's not because they've collectively recorded more than 100 albums and won 29 Grammy Awards. The agitation was because both of their instruments couldn't fit behind Bob Boilen's Tiny Desk.

There were logistical hurdles to overcome before the jazz giants' arrival. We had to move the desk to make a bigger ""stage."" Piano movers hauled the 900-pound Yamaha C7 grand piano from our first-floor performance studio up the freight elevator to the fourth-floor Tiny Desk area. But weeks of meticulous measuring and planning paid off when the rented vibes were delivered and just fit alongside the piano.

Gary Burton and Chick Corea were in town for the 2016 NEA Jazz Masters Concert. The NEA Jazz Masters fellowship is the highest honor our nation bestows on jazz artists. Each year, the program honors a select few living legends who have made exceptional contributions to the advancement of jazz. Burton was a newly appointed 2016 recipient, while Corea received the honor in 2006.

These friends first played together 44 years ago, when they recorded their very first album, Crystal Silence. In his autobiography, Gary Burton tells the story:

We set aside three days for the recording. Except for ... one tune in Munich, Chick and I hadn't worked together before Berlin, so we figured we would need a fair amount of time to choose songs and finalize arrangements. But to our amazement, it all went incredibly fast. We would spend maybe twenty minutes creating an arrangement, and then record. We did every song in just one take, except that we required a second spin through ""Senor Mouse.""
The record was finished in just a few hours, and the two realized they had a unique musical chemistry with the ability to anticipate each other's improvisational ideas. That album went on to become a classic: flawless yet fresh and forever new.

A few thousand concerts later, the jazz masters showed up at NPR HQ to perform a concert at our newly expanded Tiny Desk. On this day, it had been almost two years since Chick Corea and Gary Burton had played together — the longest break they'd ever had. But once again, their remarkable ability to connect was demonstrated in two songs they play together all the time.

faGzVf9ySmY,Weaves: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"June 10, 2016 by BOB BOILEN • There's something nearly unhinged about Weaves' music. Some of that is in the frenetic guitar of Morgan Waters and the way it contrasts with the swaying-in-the-breeze feel of singer Jasmyn Burke. But then it can all turn upside-down in a hurry — the guitar becomes almost lyrical as Burke sings:

A portion of popcorn that's popping and shopping for fresh hands
Distortion is motion that's ridden forbidden
Don't you dare, don't you dare
You're so coo coo I'm so coo coo

All the while, the rhythm section jitters and shakes, or you may find Burke flat on the floor, singing toward the ceiling.

A Toronto-based art and pop project, Weaves is a young band with just one EP and a debut album coming June 17. That album has already become a favorite of mine: The group has an eagerness to try on new sounds while always remaining playful and quirky — sometimes loud, sometimes gentle and always a trip.

syxhhSFNe-c,Sam Beam & Jesca Hoop: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"June 6, 2016 by STEPHEN THOMPSON • Sam Beam and Jesca Hoop visited NPR's offices on what may well be 2016's most beautiful day so far: perfectly warm and sunny, uncharacteristically dry, and perfect for lounging happily on the roof deck just around the corner from the Tiny Desk. Hoop and Beam did just that, hanging out amiably for hours after their show ended, as part of one of the most comfortable and relaxing days in the history of NPR Music.

The music itself was gorgeous to match, as the two performed three songs from their new collaborative record, Love Letters For Fire. If you haven't yet heard it, the album's sound fits right where you'd hope it would: between the inventive hookiness of Hoop's terrific solo work and the more somber ruminations of the work Beam makes at the head of Iron & Wine. Weeks later, watching their performance is like recapturing a little slice of that spring day, just when we need it most.

P6H3jeut9jw,Barry Douglas: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"June 3, 2016 by TOM HUIZENGA • Barry Douglas knows a few things about handing down traditions. In this Tiny Desk performance, he passes along the musical heritage of his Irish homeland in the form of old Celtic songs he's arranged for solo piano.

Douglas has also been on the receiving end of tradition. If you set up a kind of Ancestry.com for pianists, Douglas could claim a pretty impressive pedigree. One of his teachers, Felicitas LeWinter, studied with a pupil of Franz Liszt. Another of his tutors, Maria Curcio, was taught by Artur Schnabel, whose teacher's teacher was a man named Beethoven. All that training helped Douglas take home the gold medal at the 1986 Tchaikovsky International Piano Competition in Moscow.

Douglas starts with the oldest of the songs, ""The Coolin,"" which in its original language (An Chúileann) translates to ""The Fair-Haired Girl."" The lyric can be traced back to about 1641, while the melody itself, some argue, is even older. He dresses the tune in Baroque trills and a theme and variations format displaying a variety of moods.

Two quick tunes follow. The hard-driving ""Planxty Dillon"" is a dance that dates from the early 18th century. And ""The Raggle Taggle Gypsy,"" of similar vintage, originates in Scotland but quickly became popular in England and North America under alternate titles such as ""Black Jack Davy.""

Douglas finishes with ""My Lagan Love,"" a song of dubious origins yet covered by everyone from John McCormack and Sinéad O'Connor to Pete Seeger and Dusty Springfield. Inspired by the river Lagan in Ireland's northern Donegal (hear the rippling in Douglas' left hand), the song defines the melancholy Irish air, making a direct hit on the heart.

QGAzPtwUJJU,Andrew Bird: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"May 31, 2016 by BOB BOILEN • It's been a joy to hear the music of Andrew Bird shift and change. Bird's early music, from the late '90s, was steeped in hot jazz and blues music from the early days of the phonograph, then later shifted to new technologies using loop pedals to layer voice, whistling and violin. His lyrics often have a calculated quality, filled with abundant wordplay and observations.

This year, Bird made one of his most personal albums, Are You Serious. So it felt appropriate that he would play some of his most personal work in this most intimate of settings, the Tiny Desk.

For this performance of three new songs, Bird came with a stripped-down acoustic band: just drums, upright bass and acoustic guitar, with Bird himself on violin. It functioned something like a hot jazz ensemble, with no effects pedals; just the songs, front and center, sounding perfect.

On occasion, those roles have allowed her Mexican-American roots to bubble to the surface — perhaps in a line sung in Spanish, or through a reference to a classic mariachi song.

On her new album Lola, Rodriguez's bi-cultural life blossoms into a spectacular collection of stories and songs, several of which she included in this Tiny Desk concert with guitarist Luke Jacobs.

snJ_lTsMKlM,Robert Ellis: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"May 23, 2016 by LARS GOTRICH • Robert Ellis somehow finds wide-eyed wonder in heartbreak. His downbeat themes come up against sonically ambitious and lushly arranged sounds on his self-titled, fourth album, which plays with country and Americana music tradition, not to mention the legacy of '70s singer-songwriters.

So when Ellis and backing guitarist Kelly Doyle came to the NPR Music offices dressed in sharp suits (Ellis' ""uniform"" this year, he told me), they retained these meticulous and thoughtful arrangements by foregrounding the tender and timeless melodies with busy, yet reinforcing guitar work. The grandiose ""How I Love You"" becomes a slow-burner desperate with lingering desire. The fiery, bluegrass-inspired ""Drivin'"" guzzles fuel with no destination in mind, Ellis ""just surviving"" without his lover. It's a song that makes a point out of the many things we do to forget, lyrically (""I've changed all the light bulbs and had this conversation about three million times or more. I guess I'll walk around the grocery store ... again"") and musically as Ellis and Doyle's fingers blaze across guitar strings.

Ellis closes with ""California"" at the piano like the soft-rockers of yesteryear — tellingly, Bruce Hornsby's ""The Way It Is"" was teased during sound check — but he wrenches drama from his Texas twang, a soulfully bouncing rhythm and Doyle's hypnotic guitar pattern. On record, synths and electronics take the song to atmosphere, but here ""California"" is broken down as hopes fall apart.

QcGs8rBynL0,Andy Shauf: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"May 20, 2016 by ROBIN HILTON • Saskatchewan singer-songwriter Andy Shauf is the kind of guy you'd find laying low at a party, maybe tucked into the corner of a room with a drink in his hand, keeping to himself but taking everything in. He's soft-spoken and reserved, more comfortable delivering the news than being a part of it (though ""comfortable"" may be too strong a word).

Shauf's latest album is, appropriately enough, called The Party. It's an emotionally remote collection of character studies and bent observations made during a gathering of drunken fools, smooth operators and the painfully self-aware.

Andy Shauf recently brought The Party to the NPR Music offices for this quietly affecting Tiny Desk performance. His set opens with ""The Magician,"" a song about a poser schmoozing his way through a crowd, followed by ""To You,"" a slightly comical but awkward confession of unrequited love. Shauf closes with the relatively propulsive ""You're Out Wasting,"" a meditation on greed, selling out and late-night anxiety; it's from his 2015 album The Bearer Of Bad News.

YvKVs-q1oZU,Steve Kimock: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"May 16, 2016 by FELIX CONTRERAS • Those of us ""of a certain age"" have always been told to be true to ourselves, with the understanding that maturity will show us a better sense of our true selves. The hope is that we can move forward and look backward with both confidence and (hopefully) not a lot of regret.

But musicians of a certain age are often better off if they resist the tried-and-true and look for something new to stretch their sense of self. They rely on a body of work to inspire yet more growth; that way, their sound changes while still feeling familiar.

Pardon my philosophizing, but that's how I hear Steve Kimock's music — both in this video and on his latest album, Last Danger Of Frost. Long known for his electric-guitar work in improvisational settings, he's rightly considered a musician's musician. I've always thought of him as one of those gifted players whose dedication to his instrument is matched only by his imagination. There's joy in hearing Kimock play acoustically, with no filter (or pedals or amps) between his ideas and his fingers.

Special mention on this video goes to legendary bassist Bobby Vega, who commands his instrument as easily as he breathes or walks around. It's a rare treat to hear these musicians up close and unplugged.

tKTQAGYo5hE,Daymé Arocena: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"May 12, 2016 by FELIX CONTRERAS

As the U.S. and Cuba normalize relations politically, the musical effects of the thaw are already being felt. Singer Daymé Arocena invokes the orishas as she and bandmates Rafael Aldama and Jorge Luis Lagarza Perez set out to draw connections between the music of the two countries. Arocena's voice is a deft combination of Aretha Franklin's soul and the sabor of Cuban music queen Celia Cruz.

As you'll see in the video, Arocena's performances are fueled by her surprisingly mature songwriting (she's only 24), as well as an irrepressible personality that projects warmth and fun, not to mention a million-watt smile. The level of musicianship on display here provides an extraordinary window into the talent waiting to be discovered in Cuba. It's fun to imagine what other joys await.

NvHPuggkDpU,Lara St. John: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"May 9, 2016 by TOM HUIZENGA • Violinist Lara St. John has attitude in spades. It's in the sound of her playing and in the arc of her career.

Her first album cover sparked controversy, prompting many classical-music observers to wonder about her motivations until they heard the passionate Bach performances that accompanied it. Willing to take risks, St. John was among the first to start her own record label in the 1990s. It's allowed her to call the shots on her recorded repertoire, which has been satisfyingly broad, from Piazzolla to polkas to Mozart.

St. John's recent album Shiksa — recorded with pianist Matt Herskowitz, who joins her for this Tiny Desk concert — collects new arrangements of old tunes from Armenia, Romania and the Jewish diaspora.

The two know how to start off a show. The incendiary ""Czardashian Rhapsody"" mashes up two Hungarian tunes with some extra hot sauce. St. John's fiddle is at turns coy and cocky, racy, raw and just plain outrageous. Herskowitz dispatches his considerably hefty role with equal abandon. Her hair flying as if she were a glam-rock guitarist, St. John nails the big rock 'n' roll ending.

The two slow it all down for ""Sari Siroun Yar,"" a bittersweet Armenian troubadour song that opens with pearly, Asian-colored trills from Herskowitz and some sleight-of-hand magic from St. John. Bowing across the fingerboard, she captures the muted, breathy sound of the duduk, Armenia's ancient double-reed instrument.

The barnstorming grit is back for a final round of pyrotechnics in the ""Oltenian Hora."" The piece plays off a catalog of violin tricks, St. John explains, practiced by traditional Romanian gypsy fiddlers. After rapid-fire whistles, bird calls and slithery harmonics, all in a variety of off-kilter rhythms, St. John ratchets up the intensity. Practically brawling with her instrument, she saws away faster and faster, leaving her, and many of us in the room, breathless.

CEayGhxI0gk,Monika: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"May 6, 2016 by BOB BOILEN • When you hear Monika, life feels good: The singer's performances and presence are simply winning. Last fall, I saw her take a hands-in-pockets crowd in New York and turn it into a bunch of dancing, hand-waving fans. Here at the Tiny Desk, the office was singing along as the ebullient singer danced on my desk. She's a platinum-selling singer-songwriter back in Greece, and her most recent album, Secret In The Dark, is full of spunk and funk. The album was produced by the great Homer Steinweiss, whom you may know as the drummer for the soulful R&B band The Dap-Kings.

Monika Christodoulou's recent transition from singer of sad songs to purveyor of upbeat jubilance came after she nearly lost her life in a boat fire; she had to swim eight hours in the dark to safety without food or drinkable water. These days, it's all about a great band grooving, her joyful voice, and that infectious smile.

Just after winning its fourth Grammy in February, the group received a MacArthur Award for Creative and Effective Institutions; the prize came with a $400,000 grant. Hand Eye — eighth blackbird's second album in seven months — just came out, and this season the group marks its 20th anniversary. The celebration includes an extensive tour, with world premieres of music by Bryce Dessner and David T. Little, as well as a gig as a ""living installation"" at Chicago's Museum of Contemporary Art, where eighth blackbird has commandeered the third-floor galleries as a space to rehearse and perform.

It's an understatement to note that there's far less space behind Bob Boilen's desk. But after a few discussions about placement, the sextet squeezed in while making sure everyone could see each other — one of the keys to navigating rhythmically challenging pieces by David Lang, Bryce Dessner and Robert Honstein.

Right out of the gate, we meet the group's newest member, flutist Nathalie Joachim, who opens the first of two short pieces, ""Wave The Sea,"" with a scurrying theme of nervous energy. The music is by Bryce Dessner, perhaps best known for his work in The National but increasingly in demand as a classical composer. It's Dessner's take on the folk tradition of grisly story-songs collected in his larger suite, Murder Ballades.

""Pulse,"" from Robert Honstein's three-movement Conduit, seems to hover in midair. Throbbing notes from Matthew Duvall's vibraphone, Yvonne Lam's violin, Lisa Kaplan's piano and Michael J. Maccaferri's clarinet fold in one by one, as if in a round. Joachim's flute floats above while Nicholas Photinos' cello secures the bottom end, fleshing out a mesmerizing wash of sound.

David Lang's ""learn to fly,"" also from a larger work, pumps up the energy with a motorik beat, fueled by Kaplan's syncopation. The interlocking parts race on until Lam finally breaks out of the pattern, soaring in a sweepingly romantic solo.

For those who persist in predicting the death of classical music, eighth blackbird once again demonstrates that it remains vibrantly alive.

The group's new album, Hand Eye, is available now:

WbyyxIZ02Zs,Florist: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"April 29, 2016 by BOB BOILEN • In Florist, Emily Sprague and her Catskills friends sing quiet, delicate songs filled with vivid memories. ""Vacation"" is about growing up and learning about love.

""Like when I used to ride roller coasters with my dad
When a swimming pool in a hotel
Was a gift from God
Like, love, we're like a family
I don't know how to be""

""Cool And Refreshing"" finds Sprague singing about the childhood memories that we lose one by one.

""Think of me by the creek in cutoff jeans holding onto
Something that has meaning to me
I don't really think my life will ever make me
As happy as Kaaterskill Creek""

These two songs are from Florist's 2015 EP, Holdly, while the band closes its Tiny Desk concert with ""1914,"" a track from its new debut full-length, The Birds Outside Sang. On drums, you'll find a Tiny Desk alum in Felix Walworth, who was first here with Bellows, then Eskimeaux; all of these musicians are connected in some way to the Epoch, a collective from New York City. It's a creative friendship with stories to share, and its members' songs feel best in intimate settings, like a desk surrounded by old and new friends.

9GLIZrSwFWk,Peter Frampton: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"March 17, 2016 by BOB BOILEN • I could walk by Peter Frampton on the street and not recognize him. His long blond hair, which shines like a halo on his album Frampton Comes Alive! may be gone, but as soon as he sat behind the Tiny Desk and began singing, 1976 came rushing back. I worked in a record store the year Frampton Comes Alive! came out, and it was one of those records that seemed to have universal appeal. We sold a ton of copies of that double live album and I can still remember the label and number (A&M 3703) from having written it on countless sales tickets.

Forty years later, on the new album Acoustic Classics, Peter Frampton has taken those electric guitar songs, some linked forever to that unmistakable talk box effect, and stripped them down to their essence, just a few acoustic guitars and his voice. At the Tiny Desk, played by Peter and guitarist Gordon Kennedy, these songs still thrill. We had a lot of coworkers and friends come watch Frampton come alive again. It was electrifying to hear a room full of people spontaneously burst out singing on the chorus of ""Baby, I Love Your Way"" especially when many of those singing weren't alive when that song came out.

Songwriters could spend their lives hoping to write a song that connects for the ages, but Peter Frampton told the NPR crowd that two of his biggest hits came to him on a beach on the same day. The notion that one day the magic is there and the next it's gone could haunt a songwriter, but not Peter Frampton. On this day I saw one of the happiest musicians walk into our building, a man filled with joy, eager to share his tunes he's sung over and over for much of his adult life, with a fresh attitude. It was enchanting.

Xpb8L4qlrYw,Sister Sparrow & The Dirty Birds: Tiny Desk Concert,"April 25, 2016 by JOSH ROGOSIN • Sister Sparrow & The Dirty Birds' punchy horn section, bluesy vocals and uniquely transformative harmonica solos instantly demand attention. Their obvious joy in playing music together is contagious, and they brought the party to Bob Boilen's desk in a big way.

The seven-piece band, named for the pigeons of New York's Penn Station, is made up of both friends and family. Arleigh Kincheloe (nicknamed Sister Sparrow) leads with her explosive vocals. Her brother, Jackson Kincheloe, makes his harmonicas sound like an organ one moment and a screeching guitar the next; he brought a collection of 48. Sasha Brown (guitar), Josh Myers (bass), Dan Boyden (drums), Phil Rodriguez (trumpet) and Brian Graham (baritone sax) round out the dynamic septet, which just released its first live album, Fowl Play.

pVGCIH54W9g,Julia Holter: Tiny Desk Concert,"April 22, 2016 by LARS GOTRICH • Julia Holter's music exists in tiny universes, colliding in torch songs and bits of cosmic cabaret that are as reverent as they are perverse. The most minute details and the plainest words suddenly form a grandiose spectacle. Last year's Have You In My Wilderness saw Holter playing with subtle songs that unraveled more with each experience; in the NPR Music offices, those songs were given quiet and bombastic arrangements that felt close and distant at once, with a throwback to the bouncy ""In The Green Wild"" from 2013's Loud City Song.

Holter is joined by Devin Hoff (bass), Corey Fogel (drums, vocals) and Dina Maccabee (viola, vocals), and herself plays upright piano, which is a rare treat live. On tour, her keyboard allows synthetic textures to accentuate her clear voice, but when she hits the chorus in ""Sea Calls Me Home"" here, Holter floors the sustain pedal and pounds atonal chords with wild abandon as she sings, ""I can't swim / It's lucidity / So clear!"" The solo highlight ""Betsy On The Roof"" also benefits from the upright, but is quickly joined by light viola and bass as the song builds to a dramatic climax that has no choice but to fall apart in broken chords and desperate pleas.

00yQGeJ6AOM,Benjamin Clementine: Tiny Desk Concert,"April 18, 2016 by BOB BOILEN • Right near the top of this performance, Benjamin Clementine looks toward the camera with an intense stare and sings, ""Where I'm from, you see the rain / Before the rain even starts to rain."" At that point, when I'm already hanging on every word, I feel like I'm witnessing an almost otherworldly presence — a visitor with wisdom to impart.

Clementine is a musician and poet who grew up in London and later moved to Paris, where as a teenager he slept on the streets at night and busked in the daylight hours. That's how he was ""discovered,"" and in 2015, he released his first album, At Least For Now. There are intimate moments of revelation in this immersive, breathtaking performance, and his voice and piano both sound magnificent. I can't think of anyone quite like him.

uSgJbqaYS74,Seratones: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"April 15, 2016 by BOB BOILEN • Seratones singer-guitarist A.J. Hines takes gospel into the garage, and what comes out is fiery rock 'n' roll. The Shreveport, La., band is a joy to see and hear, and this Tiny Desk concert provides a fiery peek at what you'll soon hear on the group's debut album, Get Gone.

Hines grew up singing in the Brownsville Baptist Church, learning to sing out to and hit that back wall without a microphone. At the same time, bassist Adam Davis heard a lot of American rock's greatest guitarist, Jimi Hendrix, as well as the amazing voice of Janis Joplin. The rest of the band is rounded out by the drumming of Jesse Gabriel, who is spare but there with a sharp backbeat, while guitarist Connor Davis rocks with lyrical grit. Seratones won my heart when the group opened for Alabama's St. Paul and the Broken Bones back in December; now, it's getting ready to release Get Gone, due out May 6.

Get Gone is available for pre-order now.

YjIvKvXjhas,Palehound: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"April 11, 2016 by STEPHEN THOMPSON 

Last fall in New York City, NPR Music recorded a blistering concert by Palehound, in which singer, songwriter and guitarist Ellen Kempner presided over a string of tense and evocative songs about overcoming doubt and, when necessary, spitting venom. A few months ago, we jumped at the opportunity to capture Kempner's band in a quieter and more contained setting, in which Palehound could perform amid the pin-drop silence of a rapt and brightly daylit crowd.

The results — three spare, nervy renditions of songs from 2015's Dry Food — are, naturally, a bit rawer and more exposed than Palehound's earlier show in New York. But, with the aid of drummer Jesse Weiss and bassist Davood Khoshtinat, Kempner uses that intimacy to her advantage. She may have paused to show off a bit of glittery flair on her guitar (courtesy of her former tourmates in PWR BTTM), but her set felt unadorned in every other way.

TFLy8mwJWRU,Mothers: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"April 8, 2016 by BOB BOILEN 

While Kristine Leschper was singing her songs behind my desk, in the crowd was a tiny baby in a stroller. As I watched the child and the band, I couldn't help but think about both the promise and innocence of youth and the struggles of adulthood, as Leschper sang:

We lived unloved in unmade beds
You wore me like a necklace
You closed me like a locket

Mothers began as Leschper's project in art school in Athens, Ga. In their quiet moments — which at the Tiny Desk were all the moments — the songs seemed to function as a pursuit of catharsis, aided by fragile, tender melodies. The band helped hold the music together with grace and rhythm.

Two of the songs here are from Mothers' debut album, When You Walk A Long Distance You Are Tired, which came out earlier this year; there's also an aching new track called ""Mother And Wife."" Mothers chose the slowest and most languid songs to perform at the Tiny Desk — a sad, quiet, reflective approach which felt just right for the setting.

ji-EdRtL9qU,PWR BTTM: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"April 4, 2016 by BOB BOILEN 

It took only a few power chords, a sprinkle of glitter and the occasional jokey line — ""We can do our makeup in the parking lot / We can get so famous that I might get shot / But right now I'm in the shower"" — to forever hook me on PWR BTTM. The queer, glammy, wildly dressed duo has a keen sense of mischief and a real gift for honest, punk-infused, tongue-in-cheek pop gems.

Ben Hopkins (in red, fingernails included) and Liv Bruce swap roles as singers, guitarists, drummers and storytellers, each trying to playfully one-up the other. It's a show that might have worn thin if the songs (from last year's Ugly Cherries) weren't so much damn fun. Instead, they're likely to stay with you as long as the glitter has stayed in my clothes and carpet fibers.

UaTONcmNotI,Ane Brun: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"April 1, 2016 by TOM HUIZENGA 

Ane Brun recently turned 40, and she — like many of us who've reached that milestone — has been taking stock of her life. It's a life filled with music and success, but there have also been a few rough spots. Like the time we scheduled her to play a Tiny Desk concert in 2012 and she was forced to cancel an entire North American tour (with Peter Gabriel) due to a lupus flareup. Brun, a Norwegian native based in Sweden, was diagnosed with the autoimmune disease when she was 27.

But after that episode landed her in the hospital, Brun told NPR she'd had something of an epiphany. ""I got an enlightenment somehow. And also freedom. Because I feel that freedom is an absence of fear.""

Brun isn't afraid to face her demons. Many songs on her absorbing new album, When I'm Free, speak to her newfound freedom and fresh opportunities. She sings three of the album's slower, more reflective numbers for this Tiny Desk performance.

In ""Still Waters,"" Brun sings, ""How I've been longing / Oh, for this moment when / The rivers are running / Towards the same sea / For this moment when I'm free."" Her voice, with its tight vibrato and expressive coloring, walks an emotional line between vulnerability and confidence.

Brun is undervalued as a songwriter. She turns out introspective, insightful portrait pieces, rhythmically complex rockers and tender love songs which are at once sensuous and probing. ""All We Want Is Love"" sways gently, but also questions the very definition of ourselves.

She closes with another song about taking control of her destiny. The title, ""Signing Off,"" may sound ominous, but then she sings: ""Everything that's broken / Everything that's gone wrong / I am gonna carry that with me / Mend the streets with it stone by stone.""

As far as turning 40 goes, Brun says she doesn't mind time passing by. And her admirers shouldn't either. It just means more compelling albums to come from one of today's most insightful musicians.

C3lcprigQ0E,Anthony Hamilton: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"March 28, 2016 by BOBBY CARTER 

Anthony Hamilton's soul sound was refined in the churches of Charlotte, N.C. Watching the Grammy winner perform, you get the hunch that it's harder for him to keep the soul inside than it is to actually unleash it. What he and his backup singers, The Hamiltones, do would be better classified as a musical purge, with a stage show that can double as couples therapy and church service. Their warm harmonies have the ability to shrink theaters and stadiums, so we knew this intimate setting was perfect for them.

Following a spot at the final In Performance show of the Obama presidency, the singer, The Hamiltones and his band made their way over to our offices to give us a dose of what's to come, as well as a heavy helping of what fans have grown to love about him. He opens the set with ""Amen"" — the debut single from his introspective new album, What I'm Feelin' — and followed it with three songs that have defined his career.

RRipadkd6wk,Tedeschi Trucks Band: Tiny Desk Concert,"March 25, 2016 by FELIX CONTRERAS

When singer-guitarist Susan Tedeschi sings and plays, you can hear the sound move from the Mississippi Delta up to Chicago. As this video shows, she can dispense uptempo dance grooves and coax her voice around the anguished lyric of the blues.

At the same time, guitarist Derek Trucks seems to summon forth the entirety of contemporary music when he slides his bottle neck up and down the fretboard. As you'll see, The Tedeschi Trucks Band functions in the service of a collective vision that celebrates the blues, jazz and so much more.

GTXqKSMv8Lc,Graham Nash: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"While I sat on the floor watching Graham Nash play The Hollies' 1966 hit ""Bus Stop,"" I caught a glimpse of the same transistor radio I had as a kid when that song filled the AM radio airwaves. It was surreal and beautiful.

Nash has a voice that resonates and cuts to the core. When he played the title track from his forthcoming solo album This Path Tonight, I was moved by the clarity and quality of his tone. His lucid songwriting displays the deep introspection that comes with age; he's 74 and as insightful as ever. Along with guitarist Shane Fontayne, Nash played music that felt memorable, touching and as thoughtful as anything he made during his time with Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.

n6oSeODGmoQ,Gaelynn Lea: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Gaelynn Lea, the winner of NPR's second annual Tiny Desk Contest, makes music like nobody else. Her sounds are steeped in the deep melodies of great Irish fiddle tunes, but her performance and singing style aren't traditional. More than 6,000 artists submitted videos in which they performed an original song behind a desk of their choosing with the hope of winning a chance to play a Tiny Desk concert at NPR. Gaelynn Lea was the overwhelming favorite of our six judges.

After voting for Lea, I wanted to learn more about her and her remarkable talent. Following about a minute of just focusing on the desk, her video pans to a small woman in a wheelchair as she plays a violin she holds like a cello. Lea has brittle bone disease, which made it necessary for her to reinvent the ordinary — and, in this case, a way to play the fiddle.

I also discovered, after selecting Gaelynn Lea, that she'd become friends with Alan Sparhawk of the band Low. Sparhawk first heard her perform at a farmers market in Duluth, Minn., where they both live. They've become friends who sometimes make music together, recording under the name The Murder Of Crows, so I also invited Sparhawk to join Gaelynn Lea for two of her four songs at this special Tiny Desk concert. There was hardly a dry eye.

tADWPTqR_4A,Julien Baker: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"March 7, 2016 by BOB BOILEN 

There are nine spare, simple songs on Julien Baker's debut album, Sprained Ankle, and every one of them is sad. In fact, she came to the Tiny Desk with an untitled new one — since given the name ""Funeral Pyre"" — and she appropriately introduced it as ""Sad Song #11."" But Baker's shimmering electric-guitar picking, the purity of her voice and the yearning way she sings make each of her songs lovely and memorable rather than merely somber. She takes raw emotions and weaves them into perfect bits of memorable poetry like this, from the song ""Good News"":

In the thin air my ribs creak
Like wooden dining chairs when you see me
Always scared that every situation ends the same
With a blank stare

For fans of Torres, another Tennessee musician, there's a similar intensity to that electric guitar and lonesome sound. But unlike the intensity Torres unleashes with her voice, Baker lets her words carry the volume. It's a tone that lulls you into her world and has me eagerly anticipating ""Sad Song #12"" and beyond.

Monsieur Periné hails from Colombia, a country known for its Afro-Colombian cumbia, as well as New York-style salsa. Instead, however, the band has embraced 1920s-era, guitar-driven jazz from the U.S. The unlikely inspiration has resulted in a large and international following, as well as a Latin Grammy not too long ago: Monsieur Periné was named 2015's Best New Artist.

Words don't do this band justice. Play the video and discover Monsieur Periné's magic for yourself.

gdRAcoD5Gt0,Lake Street Dive: Tiny Desk Concert,"February 29, 2016 by BOB BOILEN 

These four musicians made their first record together a decade ago, but for many of us, 2016 will be the year Lake Street Dive becomes a household name. The appeal of this band of New England Conservatory friends lies in their warmth in harmony and comfortably styled songs — sometimes tilting toward soul, often rocking danceably on a new collection of songs called Side Pony.

At first, it may be Rachael Price and her charismatic voice that draws you to this Tiny Desk concert, but it won't take long to see that this isn't just a singer and her backing band. The ""two Mikes"" (trumpeter and guitarist Mike ""McDuck"" Olson and drummer Mike Calabrese), along with upright bassist Bridget Kearney, share in the songwriting and singing, and contribute mightily to these creative arrangements. You can hear everyone mesh so well in these three new songs from Side Pony -- songs likely to be favorites for many at year's end.

rFtP7Xc_Fbo,Brushy One String: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"February 27, 2016 by BOB BOILEN

Artists shine given restrictions and limitations. Subtlety and nuance are more easily found in minimalism than excess. That's the beauty of Brushy One String, whose sound is make by one big fat E-string and a voice so rich and full, all it wants is a bit of rhythmic and melodic underpinning.

Brushy One String is from Jamaica, and his ""Chicken In The Corn"" video has been viewed nearly nine million times. I first came upon his music at globalFEST 2014. He even broke his one string that night, but he smiled and warmed our hearts. He's a deeply spiritual man who tells stories of his musical father and describes how proud his mom and dad would be of his fame if they were around. (He was orphaned at a young age.) He's part Delta Blues with a bit of old-school soul, and he beats a pulse and rhythm on the guitar body that's infectious and simple. That's the beauty of Brushy One String: It's all essence, and everything's essential.

R2osJjSNxTE,Behind The Scenes At The Tiny Desk in 360˚: Wilco,"Note: If you're on mobile, we strongly recommend opening this video in the YouTube app. 

February 25, 2016 by Bob Boilen

Since we started making Tiny Desk Concerts almost eight years ago, we've had more than 500 artists play the Tiny Desk, our own little makeshift concert venue right in the middle of NPR's offices in DC. From huge stars like Adele to T-Pain to up-and-comers like Car Seat Headrest and actual big bands like Mucca Pazza, all these musicians actually play behind MY desk — but I move out of the way when they set up.

This is one of the things that always surprises people when they visit NPR — that the Tiny Desk isn't a set. So we decided to give everyone a peek behind the scenes on a Monday afternoon earlier this month, when Wilco just happened to be stopping by.

We invited a company called RYOT to bring two 360-degree cameras to our offices and put them right in the front row of the audience. Then we filmed the whole thing, starting before Wilco even set up, before the staff flocked from all over the building to see the band play. Not only can you see the band up close, but if you look around, you'll see everything else that goes into making a Tiny Desk concert. You'll see our brilliant and calm engineer, Josh Rogosin. You'll see our lead videographer and producer of Tiny Desk Concerts, Niki Walker, along with her intern, Kara Frame. Then, of course, there's the crowd — what a lucky bunch. Many of them work here, many are lucky friends of people who work here. You'd probably recognize some of the voices in this radio crowd.

If you've never watched a 360-degree video before, we can help. There's lots to look around and spot – in fact, if you look really carefully, you might be able to find seven of Wilco's album covers around the desk and references to each one that we hid in the crowd. And of course, enjoy the song itself, one of Wilco's unforgettable tunes, ""Misunderstood"" from the 1996 album Being There. On the left you'll see Mikael Jorgensen playing the melodica, Nels Cline on that resonator guitar, Jeff Tweedy singing and strumming, John Stirratt playing guitar and singing strongly alongside Jeff, Pat Sansone on banjo and glockenspiel, while in the back holding it all together and sometimes tearing it apart is drummer Glenn Kotche.

And when you're all done here, you can watch Wilco play all four of the songs they performed at this Tiny Desk concert. For those of us here at NPR, you can guess how boring the day seemed after this.

You can watch the full (non-360) Wilco Tiny Desk here:

KMQQqa21ZVs,Wilco: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"February 23, 2016 by BOB BOILEN 

Thousands of bands have made strong debuts, and many of those have made good second and third records — it's harder, but not unusual. It's truly rare to make your 10th album exciting and relevant more than 20 years on. For all that, I'd say Wilco is an American legend.

Though Wilco is basically a conventional rock band in form — guitars, bass, drums, keyboards, one lead songwriter — it defies expectations in so many other ways. In 2001, the group put an entire new album (the instant classic Yankee Hotel Foxtrot) online for all to hear; it's one thing to do that in 2015, as Wilco did with Star Wars, but it was virtually unheard-of in 2001.

This is a deeply imaginative band, with evocative imagery and relatable storytelling; drummer Glenn Kotche is one of the best around, while Nels Cline's crazy, textured guitar layers add adventure to everything he touches. I could go on, but let's just say that breaking my rule of never bringing a band back to the Tiny Desk — Wilco performed here back in 2011 — was easy once I heard Star Wars.

Wilco opened this set with ""The Joke Explained"" from that album, but then dug deep into its catalog, performing 1996's ""Misunderstood"" and two songs from the 1999 pop masterpiece Summerteeth. I'm thinking we make a date: When Wilco turns 25 in a few years, let's break more rules and bring back their magic once more.

VNMms_zGbnI,Ben Folds: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Watching Ben Folds perform his songs on piano at the Tiny Desk, there seems to be a direct line between thought and expression, except perhaps when he stumbles or forgets a line or two. Folds has a knack for plainspoken, smartly crafted words that sometimes sting and always seem to speak the truth — like these words from ""Phone In A Pool"":

""Seems what's been good for the music
Hasn't always been so good for the life""

At the Tiny Desk, Folds opened with three sharp songs from his most recent album So There, a collaboration with six musicians who straddle the line between pop and classical music; they're known as the yMusic Ensemble. When he finished those tunes, he asked the crowd for requests, at which point he banged out two favorites on piano: ""Emaline,"" which dates back to the '80s, and a foot-stomper from his second album with Ben Folds Five, ""One Angry Dwarf And 200 Solemn Faces."" It's a memorable performance recounting memorable moments from second grade and beyond, as simple and direct as its closing line: ""Kiss my ass.""

jiNvJKF-pks,Chelsea Wolfe: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"On last year's Abyss, Chelsea Wolfe explicitly rendered the metallic tendencies that have always existed just below the surface of her music. Wolfe's soulful howl found its bite in gigantic riffs and devastating volume that suited some of her most significant songwriting yet. But at the Tiny Desk, Wolfe took her songs back to their primal form with just her voice, a muffled electric guitar and a loop pedal.

Removed from thunderous distortion, the ghostly ""Maw"" becomes a nightmare in broad daylight, as Wolfe details ""shattered teeth under a dripping tongue"" just waiting ""in this silence while you're sleeping."" ""Crazy Love,"" a love song that's dangerous in its desperation, sounds no less chilling. But it's ""Iron Moon,"" inspired by the poetry of a Chinese factory worker who took his own life, that's the most stripped of its metal. Wolfe's guitar sounds muddy and dank as she sings, ""My heart is an empty tomb / My heart is an empty room,"" recalling the lonesome wail of Kitty Wells shot through the darkness.

RZZHTVr-r-g,Car Seat Headrest: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"February 8, 2016 by BOB BOILEN 

For a singer who's sought privacy in the parking lot of a Target so he could record vocals in the backseat of his car, Will Toledo hasn't been shy about sharing his work. By age 23, he'd already released a dozen albums. Toledo, who records under the name Car Seat Headrest, is prolific but never conventional.

He performed this Tiny Desk Concert mostly solo — with occasional input from his nearby Leesburg, Va., friends and Seattle bandmates — for a set that represents only a tiny sliver of what you'll find on a Car Seat Headrest album. Those records can be filled with rich textures, chaos and harmony, sometimes in the same few minutes. But what you're about to discover here is a wordsmith with a vision, wrapping his faults and frailties in a DIY sound that's still finely crafted.

C5EjS_ZEE_I,EL VY: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"It's fun to see something truly new from someone whose work you love. Matt Berninger came to the Tiny Desk as lead singer of The National a few years ago, but this time he's collaborating with Brent Knopf from the bands Menomena and Ramona Falls. EL VY is their new project, and the two are perfect foils for each other — especially in this intimate setting, which highlights Knopf's playful piano and Berninger's resonant voice. The words at times seem autobiographical; more specifically, they're about a time in Cincinnati when Berninger fell in love with music. He says some of the songs' reflective tone was inspired by seeing his own daughter start to find the same passion.

In concert and on their debut album Return To The Moon, EL VY is a richly textured band. Here, you get something special: At the Tiny Desk, it's almost like watching two artists discover their own songs, which in some ways is how this material came to be in the first place.

4W0f7FmcJyg,The Arcs: NPR Tiny Desk Concert,"January 25, 2016 by BOB BOILEN 

Today, we celebrate the release of our 500th Tiny Desk concert. It's amazing that something that started as a bit of a wisecrack has been so widely embraced by artists and fans. In 2008 at SXSW in Austin, NPR Music's Stephen Thompson and I met up to see singer Laura Gibson. Laura was so quiet, and the crowd was so loud and rude — something about a March basketball game — that Stephen jokingly asked her to come play at my desk so we could hear her. My lightbulbs went off, and a month later, Laura came to D.C.; I was ready with a couple of cameras, a microphone, my desk and a chair.

In the years since, we've had the privilege of enjoying intimate moments with Adele, Tom Jones, T-Pain, The Tallest Man On Earth, Mavis Staples, Phoenix, Reggie Watts, Andrew W.K., Kacey Musgraves, John Legend, Ralph Stanley, Sylvan Esso, Lianne La Havas and 486 more. It's a list that includes opera singers, Romanian brass bands, legendary bluegrass singers and pickers, a Colombian jazz harpist, a bagpiper, legends of country, jazz, rock, R&B... and, most importantly, artists unknown.

This Tiny Desk Concert with The Arcs is a perfect intersection of the known and the unknown. The band is headed by Dan Auerbach, whom we know from The Black Keys. It's also fronted by Richard Swift, one of the best modern producers of intriguing pop music; he can be found on drums in The Arcs alongside a contemporary R&B drumming legend in Homer Steinweiss, known for his work in The Dap-Kings and with Amy Winehouse. It's a bundle of talent that also includes the Mariachi band Flor de Toloache, which provides backing vocals and plays violin, trumpet and guitar. The songs from The Arcs' album Yours, Dreamily provide a finely crafted blend of soul and pop, with enough playfulness to keep it fun, not perfect.

That's the spirit of the Tiny Desk: It's casual, with a mix of artistry and adventure that's different from hearing a record or seeing a band on a big stage. It's a tiny window that's both intimate and a bit awkward — and always revealing and entertaining.

Yours, Dreamily, is available now.

nYN2SDjnNW8,Wolf Alice: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"January 22, 2016 by BOB BOILEN 

I think of Wolf Alice as noisy and primal, but at the Tiny Desk, the band showed a different side — one that was childlike, pretty and quietly wonderful. I knew the three songs the group played from Wolf Alice's 2015 album My Love Is Cool, but I hardly recognized them at first. One test when you're trying to spot talent is seeing how artists step up to a challenge, and Wolf Alice's songs sound muscular even when stripped of volume. The Mercury Prize-nominated British band is a great discovery, and I'm still enchanted.

Iyzf1EKNyno,River Whyless: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"January 19, 2016 by BOB BOILEN

This immensely talented band from Asheville, N.C., was my favorite discovery at this year's Americana Music Festival. River Whyless builds its music around fiddle, guitar and harmonies, with imagination and textures that set the band apart from many of its acoustic and folk-based peers.

At the Tiny Desk, River Whyless' members used a typewriter for rhythm, a toy piano for whimsy and a harmonium for mood, as well as a gong, multiple odd percussive accents and subtle guitar effects. There are hints of Paul Simon in their inflections and poetic phrasing, and their songs feel fresh and nicely crafted. ""Life Crisis"" is a song from 2015's self-titled EP, but the others are new to me; here's hoping we'll have a new album in 2016.

9jVn_JCjpT4,Benny Sings: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"January 15, 2016 by BOBBY CARTER 

For more than 10 years, fans have been drawn to Dutch singer-songwriter Benny Sings' ability to layer R&B, jazz and pop over hip-hop foundations. While it was only a matter of time before he'd play behind the Tiny Desk, we never expected the performance to be his very first in the U.S. This is also where he performed with background vocalist Jennah Bell for the first time. As a bonus, his beat machine was miraculously repaired following a malfunction minutes prior to showtime.

All that should have revved up a fair amount of paranoia, but Benny Sings quickly shed any evidence of nervousness and jumped into action like a veteran, performing a song from his latest album (""Beach House,"" from Studio) and an old favorite.

iOdsAE8Mq7I,Natalie Merchant: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"January 12, 2016 by BOB BOILEN 

In the summer of 2014, Natalie Merchant came to Washington, D.C., to perform her first album of all-new material in 13 years. She was supposed to play here at my desk the day after that evening's performance. Instead, she fell ill, wound up in a D.C. hospital, and canceled her upcoming dates.

Now, Merchant has rerecorded her first solo album Tigerlily, complete with strings and different instrumentation. That album is called Paradise Is There: The New Tigerlily Recordings, and she recently came back to town to make a documentary film about that record. And so it was with abundant joy that Natalie Merchant finally made it to the NPR Music offices. This was truly one of the most warmhearted Tiny Desk performances I've ever seen. She sang two songs from that self-titled 2014 release and something from Tigerlily, and then Merchant had the NPR audience join her for a beautiful hymn — so have a tissue handy.

-rl26QKPHtE,Mariachi Flor De Toloache: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"January 8, 2016 by FELIX CONTRERAS
Mariachi Flor de Toloache's 2014 self-titled debut album earned a Latin Grammy nomination in the Best Ranchera category — quite an accomplishment, given that the category celebrates an incredibly long tradition of Mexican music. But it was no fluke: The group's members come by their mariachi skills honestly and with endless practice, while still looking for ways to take chances.

Still, the best way to introduce yourself to Mariachi Flor de Toloache is to see it live — something many have done as the band tours with The Arcs, both as members and as an opening act. It's got top-notch musicianship, mariachi swagger for days, and a performance style that captures all the power and emotion you'd hope for.

7d2mC9zDkKE,Rapsody: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"January 5, 2016 by BOBBY CARTER 
Rapsody has waited patiently for her time to shine. Through seven solo projects, she's grown as an MC, crafting her own style while developing her thesis in the rap game. True breakthroughs are commonly marked by a pivotal moment, and hers came when she provided the sole rap guest verse on the most talked-about album of 2015, Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp A Butterfly.

Flanked by her mentor and label head, producer 9th Wonder, as well as The Storm Troopers, Rapsody recently stopped by the Tiny Desk to perform three songs from her album Beauty And The Beast. With charismatic authority, as well as copious shoutouts to the many Howard University students in the room, her performance combined vigorous wordplay with introspective storytelling. In 2015, Rapsody had her big moment. This year, she's seizing it.

When Jones sings, ""We're cooking up the brisket the kosher butcher sold my uncle Saul,"" it sent my memories reeling.

q9xLciMB1RA,Son Little: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"December 18, 2015 by BOB BOILEN
Son Little's music pushes gospel and blues into the 21st century with guitar processing, including backward drones, and choirs made from his looped voice. As wonderful as his 2015 self-titled album sounds, having him at the Tiny Desk with his acoustic guitar and unprocessed voice, accompanied only by his soulful singing sister, Megan Livingston, and percussionist Jabari Exum was gently uplifting. The man born Aaron Livingston is the son of a preacher and knows how to deliver, how to connect directly to the heart. His sound is wonderfully universal, and here, at the Tiny Desk, magnificently subtle.

TtYtyz8KE74,Shakey Graves: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"December 15, 2015 by BOB BOILEN 
When Alejandro Rose-Garcia, aka Shakey Graves, breaks out his guitar and suitcase kick drum/hi-hat, a palpable rush of swooning adrenaline hits the room. I felt that at the Americana Festival in Nashville, at the Newport Folk Festival and here at the Tiny Desk.

The Texas singer's charisma is matched by his warm, sometimes frenetic music — he attempted a stage dive at the Tiny Desk — which mixes country, blues and rock 'n' roll. If you don't know Shakey Graves' music, the best way to fall in love with him is in a live setting like this one.

p8cHEKNu1V4,Land Lines: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"December 11, 2015 by BOB BOILEN
When I first saw this Denver trio on its home turf last spring, I was swiftly drawn into its mysterious swirl. Martina Grbac sings quietly, and her voice — echoing and effects-laden — sits nicely on top of her percussive cello, James Han's textures and Ross Harada's perfectly placed percussion.

Land Lines' music isn't jazz or rock, classical or electronica. Instead, it's at the heart of what I want in music: something singular, new and adventurous. After the show in Denver, I invited Land Lines to come to Washington to play at the Tiny Desk, then waited eagerly. The band did not disappoint.

rwvCEWWWt7Q,The Oh Hellos: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"December 8, 2015 by BOB BOILEN
When The Oh Hellos piled out of a van at NPR, someone remarked that it was like a clown car: Band members just kept coming, including brother and sister Tyler and Maggie Heath and their mom. They were all road-weary, trading sniffles, coughs and more. But the nine-piece group brought anthemic joy to the Tiny Desk in the form of buoyant songs whose underpinnings could still be dark and lonely.

Some of the music here is from The Oh Hellos' recent second album, Dear Wormwood, which was inspired in part by the writings of C.S. Lewis; it's about a protagonist who doubts a relationship before finding the resolve to never look back. Still, for all the deep sentiment, the band brings the same jubilant energy it brought to its performance at the Newport Folk Festival in July — even now that summer fun has given way to winter germs. Fortunately, the only contagion you'll encounter here is joy.

bEeCz5scUZs,Protomartyr: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"December 4, 2015 by ROBIN HILTON
The Detroit band Protomartyr makes loud, screeching rock that's more thoughtful than thrilling. It only takes a few seconds of the group's brightly lit Tiny Desk performance for things to get pretty deep: ""False happiness is on the rise,"" enigmatic frontman Joe Casey deadpans. ""See the victims piled high in a room without a roof.""

The song ""Why Does It Shake?"" is from the band's profound, poetic, often grousing third album The Agent Intellect, a title derived from Aristotle's theories about human thought and how ideas move from the possible to the tangible. (Cue sound of brain exploding.)

Casey never cracks a smile and barely moves throughout this performance, hiding behind dark sunglasses and looking sharp in a gray suit, hands in pockets. It's almost bewildering at times to watch someone so composed deliver such sharp narratives, backed by squealing guitar noise. But that's part of Protomartyr's allure. Casey quietly contains the storm as Protomartyr finishes its set with the darkly twisted ""Devil In His Youth,"" also from The Agent Intellect, and the ruminative ""Three Swallows,"" from the band's 2012 debut on Urinal Cake Records, No Passion All Technique.

The Agent Intellect is available now. (iTunes) (Amazon)

A4CnP6RPugo,Teddy Abrams: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"November 30, 2015 by TOM HUIZENGA 
If we're relying on the younger generation to help boost interest in classical music, look no further than Teddy Abrams. The 28-year-old pianist, clarinetist, conductor and composer has just begun his second season as music director of the Louisville Orchestra and he's brimming with ideas on what to do with Bach, Beethoven and music made today.

For his first week on the job in Louisville, Abrams played jazz piano in the streets and took his orchestra players into nightclubs and African-American churches. PBS made a web series on his first season. Earlier this year, he put two first symphonies on the same program — Brahms' First and a debut symphony by Sebastian Chang, a composer still in his 20s — just to gauge audience reaction. Abrams filled the hall by giving out free tickets to first-time symphonygoers. He was happy to hear that many of them liked the new piece best, saying they appreciated hearing the composer introduce it onstage.

Abrams doesn't treat composers like museum exhibits to be handled with white gloves. For this Tiny Desk performance, Adams decided to begin the opening movement of Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 30 with a short improvisation, noting that the great composer was known for riffing at the piano for hours on end.

The set opens and closes with tunes by Abrams himself. The first, ""Big Band,"" swirls with jazz history. Hints of Thelonious Monk fly by, along with tips of the hat to the stride style from the early 20th century. Abrams ends with a bluesy number, ""The Long Goodbye,"" describing it as a slow ballad halfway between ""My Funny Valentine"" and ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow."" How fascinating it will be to watch him as he continues to delight and challenge audiences.

Set List
Abrams: ""Big Band""
Abrams: Improvisation/Beethoven: Sonata No. 30 in E, Op. 109, I. Vivace, ma non troppo
Abrams: ""The Long Goodbye""

20XhDSMmalA,Youth Lagoon NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Updated November 23, 2015 by ROBIN HILTON
Trevor Powers, the songwriter and frontman of Youth Lagoon, has never attempted to hide his navel-gazing anxieties. On his 2011 debut (The Year Of Hibernation) and its 2013 followup (Wondrous Bughouse), Powers documents a lifetime of existential crises with swirling questions about spirituality, mortality and his own mental state. Powers has also looked the part, appearing in photos and on stage wearing oversize pop-bottle glasses, with slumped shoulders and a mop of disheveled hair.

Youth Lagoon's latest album, Savage Hills Ballroom, doesn't obliterate this image — Powers still searches for answers to life's biggest questions — but it's by far Youth Lagoon's most powerful, purposeful, confident work. The songs are expansive, self-assured and exquisitely produced.

It's a shift you can see and hear in Youth Lagoon's Tiny Desk performance. In person, Powers is poised, appearing almost joyful at times. The glasses are gone, the hair's under control, and his idiosyncratic voice is far less fragile, in part because he (like nearly every artist who's graced the Tiny Desk) had to fill the room without the benefit of singing through an amp.

Youth Lagoon treated the office to two songs from the new album: the heartbreaking tale of addiction ""Kerry,"" as well as ""Rotten Human,"" a meditation on the passage of time and search for purpose in life. And, as if to give a nod to his twitchy beginnings, Powers included ""July,"" a wistful reflection on youth and regret from the band's debut.

0TiEO149Ydc,The Wild Reeds: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"November 20, 2015 by BOB BOILEN 
Great singers aren't easy to come by, so finding three in one band is something special. The Wild Reeds' music shines when Sharon Silva, Kinsey Lee and Mackenzie Howe harmonize, but each also takes a leading role — and that's the power of the L.A. band, whose songs are clear and memorable, potent and sometimes delicate.

The Wild Reeds' 2014 debut album Blind And Brave only hints at the talent on display here. Here, the group opens with my favorite song from the record, ""Where I'm Going,"" and then offers a taste of 2016 with two new ones. Next year ought to be a big year for The Wild Reeds, and this Tiny Desk Concert will show you what I mean.

8KUV2TFTpGo,Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concerts,"November 17, 2015 by BOB BOILEN Nathaniel Rateliff and his band The Night Sweats are on fire, with concerts that get feet moving and bodies swaying, fueled by rhythm and booze.

It wasn't always this way: In the past, Rateliff would be more easily described as a folk artist. When I saw him recently at a sold-out Sunday-night show in D.C., he expressed intense gratitude for the new audience that's found him. Much of that new crowd has embraced the big-band R&B of his new album, Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats, which was produced by Richard Swift and released on the legendary Stax Records.

The record and its songs embrace not only Southern soul, but also the rockier side of soul made famous by Irish singer Van Morrison. Here at the Tiny Desk, Rateliff's body-shaking tunes take on a slightly more laid-back sound, served with a warm heart and suitable for a cold beer.

osf1gckzf70,Rahim AlHaj NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"November 13, 2015 by SURAYA MOHAMED Ancestor to the lute and the guitar, the oud ‎is an ancient stringed instrument commonly played throughout the Middle East, North Africa and countries like Greece and Turkey. The oud has charmed audiences for more than 5,000 years, and the tradition continues with this reverent performance by one of the world's best players, Rahim AlHaj.

Born in Baghdad, AlHaj possesses a life story as powerful as his music. He learned to play the oud at age 9, and later graduated with honors and a degree in music composition from the Institute of Music in Baghdad. He also earned a degree in Arabic literature from Mustunsiriya University in Baghdad. Active in the underground revolutionary movement, AlHaj wrote protest songs opposing Saddam Hussein's repressive regime. He was imprisoned twice, once for a year and a half, and was regularly beaten by his captors. In 1991, AlHaj was forced to leave Iraq because of his political activism, and ultimately found a home in New Mexico.

Today, he composes traditional and contemporary pieces for a variety of ensembles — solo oud, string quartets and symphony orchestras. He performs around the world and has even collaborated with Kronos Quartet and R.E.M. AlHaj stopped by the Tiny Desk while in Washington, D.C., to receive a well-deserved NEA National Heritage Fellowship.

The set starts with a solo performance, followed by three songs in which he's accompanied by Palestinian-American percussionist Issa Malluf. Malluf plays the daf, a large circular drum with a hardwood frame, and a stretched and shaved goat skin that produces a gently melodic tonality. The dumbek is a goblet-shaped drum with a tight head make of goatskin, heated by a lamp to keep the skin taut in order to produce a consistent tone.

Though wordless, AlHaj's music tells powerful stories about the blessedness and fragility of life. The first song is intended to serve as a voice for millions of displaced and murdered Iraqi children whose cries will never be heard. Small but powerful, the oud reveals their stories of joy and pain while conveying a deep understanding of their sad history and hopeful future.

uzzVdi3HOfU,My Bubba: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"November 06, 2015 by BOB BOILEN
My Bubba is the duo of Sweden's My and Iceland's Bubba, women whose quirky, delicate, sweetly sung folk songs are a delight. The centerpiece of their tunes are the harmonies, but the backing instrumentation is equally intimate, from handclaps to an old table harp and acoustic guitar.

The pair's current album, Goes Abroader, was produced by Noah Georgeson, who's known for his work with Joanna Newsom, Cate Le Bon and Devendra Banhart. As for this Tiny Desk Concert, it's best viewed on a comfy couch, perhaps snuggled up with a friend, your favorite animal or both.

evBgLWQwAFA,Aurora: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"November 09, 2015 by BOB BOILEN  The first time I saw Aurora sing, it appeared so new to her that each note, and each hand gesture accompanying each note, seemed like a discovery and an adventure for the singer. She was 18 when I first saw her in New York City, and now the Norwegian singer is 19; take a look at this Tiny Desk Concert, and her sense of innocence and discovery still rings as true as ever.

Aurora has just one EP and some singles out so far, and ever since seeing her at CMJ in 2014, I've been eager for her debut album. Early next year, we should finally have it — as well as more chances to see Aurora live, as she plans on touring the U.S. in the spring.

nRnPD-KW-0M,Diane Coffee: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"November 02, 2015 by ROBIN HILTON
Diane Coffee gives the kind of live performances you talk about for weeks after seeing. It's not that the band tears up the stage. There's no elaborate light show or other orchestrated theatrics. The main attraction — and the reason you'll want to watch and hear more — is Diane Coffee's fantastically flamboyant lead singer, Shaun Fleming.

Conjuring both Mick Jagger and David Bowie, Fleming swaggers and shimmies on stage. He strikes playfully defiant poses, hands on hips, while his face does its own dance, with wildly exaggerated expressions: raised brows, eyes wide open, mouth enunciating every word. Not bad for someone known primarily as the drummer in Foxygen.

For the first half of this Tiny Desk performance, Fleming remained relatively restrained behind the mic, strumming an acoustic guitar. The band opened with ""Spring Breathes,"" a sprawling showpiece with so many change-ups it feels like an entire album's worth of music, followed by the melancholy and soulful ""Not That Easy."" Both cuts are from Diane Coffee's sophomore full-length, Everybody's A Good Dog.

But for the second half of the set, Fleming put down the guitar and let himself off the leash, gyrating and wildly gesturing to the crowd as he belted out the words to ""Mayflower."" By the end of the song, Fleming was winded, panting and gulping water, trying to catch his breath before closing with the girl group-inspired ""Green,"" from Diane Coffee's 2013 debut, My Friend Fish. In the end, Fleming and the rest of Diane Coffee had left it all on the Tiny Desk floor — in as much as anyone can when performing for a roomful of people working at computers.

RM3hj-6F1pk,The Suffers: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"The first time I saw 10-piece Houston big band The Suffers, it was at a small venue in Washington, D.C., called DC9. The club was barely big enough to contain all the horns, guitars and percussion, not to mention the undeniable force of the music.

October 27, 2015 by BOB BOILEN 
At first, I couldn't pull my attention away from irrepressible singer Kam Franklin, whose down-to-earth but uplifting presence put a huge smile on my face. But as The Suffers' set progressed, I became increasingly enchanted with the band, which was part Archie Bell & The Drells and part James Brown, with a touch of New Orleans and even Jamaican reggae.

It was a perfect mix of power and delicacy, as the band held back at moments only to steamroll me when my guard was down. The group has only two EPs, with an album on the way, and trust me: 2016 will be The Suffers' year. Look for the band on far bigger stages soon enough.

Q-AJMUh2_Ug,Beauty Pill: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"October 23, 2015 by LARS GOTRICH • Beauty Pill's music is an invitation. In it, life whirs with plunderphonic glee and riffs are funky from the inside out, with rhythms that are equal parts hip-hop and go-go. Conceived, recorded and meticulously tinkered with over the course of eight years, Beauty Pill Describes Things As They Are was partly made in front of an audience after member Chad Clark recovered from a viral infection in his heart that nearly killed him. It's one of the year's most stunning records, as well as an argument for letting art rest, live and breathe before it's ready to be known by a listener.

With such a deeply textured group of songs, it was hard to predict how the D.C. band would translate in the NPR Music office. But Beauty Pill didn't strip down, nor did it remove anything vital; the band thought about and adapted to the space, even if Clark was a little late arriving due to a lost dog on a highway. Jean Cook's Monome (for lack of a better descriptor, a sampler sequencer) plays a major role in this phase of Beauty Pill; in performance, the samples give levity to the dark and true themes of ""Drapetomania!"" as Cook bounces and conducts the glowing buttons and Clark defiantly declares, ""I want more life, f*****.""

Clark introduces ""Exit Without Saving"" as ""either a Microsoft Word document or a situation where you feel trapped,"" pauses to tune, and quickly (even sheepishly) adds, ""But you're not!"" It's an atmospheric piece of work with guitars on infinite delay, Basla Andolsun's heartbeat-pulse bass line, and a mantra — ""You recognize that this is noise, right?"" — that takes on its own meaning every time it's repeated.

A805D9CVAr0,Paolo Angeli: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"October 19, 2015 by ANASTASIA TSIOULCAS 
Paolo Angeli has a whole toy shop aboard his guitar: He's got hammers, pedals, propellers, springs, drone strings and even a couple of cell-phone ringers at his disposal.

The base of it all is a six-stringed instrument from his native island of Sardinia, and the seed of Angeli's sonic creations is traditional Sardinian music. But in the same way that he's turned his guitar into something new, Angeli twists and turns that tradition into musical magic, in creations that skim over jazz, experimental, improvisational, classical and punk — embracing all, yet not quite belonging to any. All those toys let him create a palette of super-saturated colors and unbelievably varied textures.

Angeli, who's based in Barcelona, describes his set-up as ""a one-man band for the new millennium."" The setup may be futuristic, but the music he creates is deeply human — warm and full of humor and wit, just like Angeli himself.

mVJjmyFfuts,Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"October 09, 2015 by PATRICK JARENWATTANANON 
Artists don't usually tell long, rambling stories at the Tiny Desk, and if they do, those stories don't usually make the final cut. But this one felt different. It was about the time Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah, a young black man, says he was stopped by New Orleans police late at night for no reason other than to harass and intimidate him. And how his pride almost made him do something ill-advised about it. And how he finally channeled that pent-up frustration into a piece of music whose long-form title is ""Ku Klux Police Department.""

""K.K.P.D."" was the emotional peak of the septet's performance, though it wasn't a new tune. That's notable, because Scott stopped by the Tiny Desk on the very day his new album came out. It was played by something of a new band, though: Flutist Elena Pinderhughes, saxophonist Braxton Cook and guitarist Dominic Minix are new, younger additions to the group. It had new textures, too: Drummer Corey Fonville (another new member) used a djembe as a bass drum, and also brought a MIDI pad so he could emulate the sound of a drum machine. The effect was something like an evocation of African roots, juxtaposed with a trap beat.

The first two numbers were, in fact, from Scott's new album Stretch Music. That's his name for the particular type of jazz fusion he's up to: something more seamless than a simple collision of genre signifiers; something whose DNA is already hybridized and freely admits sonic elements which potentially ""stretch"" jazz's purported boundaries. (You may note that he showed up in a Joy Division sleeveless T-shirt and gold chain.) It's sleek and clearly modern, awash in guitar riffs, but also bold and emotionally naked. Scott is particularly good at getting you to feel the energy he sends pulsing through his horn, and he never shies away from going all-in on a solo. The least we could offer was to let him explain himself in doing so.

yhSjdfE07u8,Oh Pep!: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"October 16, 2015 by BOB BOILEN
I've seen Oh Pep! four times in three cities in the past month, and needless to say, the Melbourne band's music is infectious. Oh Pep gets its Oh from Olivia Hally (vocals, guitar) and its Pep! from Pepita Emmerichs (violin, mandolin). These Australians fit well in Nashville during an Americana music festival, as they played fiddles and mandolins alongside guitars, bass and drums. Their harmonies are sweet, with lyrics that are thoughtful, deep, funny and poetic.

Hally and Emmerichs told me they used to sit in their bedrooms back home watching Tiny Desk Concerts, so this day at NPR was a bit surreal for them, as they'd already traveled thousands of miles. Thankfully, Oh Pep!'s performance harnessed that surreality for a performance filled with magic.

I've heard many a great record only to be disappointed by a live show. But when I heard Andra Day sing ""Forever Mine"" from her album Cheers To The Fall, I decided to break my rule, sight unseen.

When Day started warming up for this set, I could see that she was born to perform. She's able to channel the likes of Nina Simone and Billie Holiday in songs that feel candid and vulnerable, but not understated.

Day studied singing in a performing-arts high school in San Diego. A live performance found its way to Stevie Wonder after a chance meeting with his wife. Day was then introduced to songwriter and producer Adrian Gurvitz and then Raphael Saadiq to help her make Cheers To The Fall. This is an unforgettable performance, and she's got a talented backing band to boot.

Cheers To The Fall is available now.

GeZ_gq7DdsY,Deqn Sue: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"October 05, 2015 by BOB BOILEN 
Deqn Sue rose above a crowd of close to 7,000 entries and almost won our Tiny Desk Concert Contest earlier this year. I so loved her song and her performance of ""Magenta"" that I invited Deqn Sue — along with her producer, Kelvin Wooten — to my desk to perform that song and more.

What you'll hear is a witty soul and a powerful singer backed by precise beats, melodic bass and electronics, all wrapped in humor and heart. You can find the first song she performs here — ""Bloody Monster,"" which she wrote after being on the receiving end of a racist comment from her roommate — on a new EP called Snack. And you can watch her Tiny Desk Concert Contest video entry here.

In 2012, my kids introduced me to Lianne La Havas' debut album, Is Your Love Big Enough? One play and I was hooked; I've been a fan ever since. Her music works for any activity, any emotion.

The first time I saw La Havas live, I was unprepared for the experience: Her music touched my heart in a way I'd never experienced before. I cried through the entire performance. Her music was that powerful, with lyrics woven together with beautiful harmonies; it pulled emotions out of me I didn't even know existed.

La Havas is soulful yet playful, raw and vulnerable in a commanding kind of way, and her new second album, Blood, is as amazing as the first. In this Tiny Desk performance, she plays two new songs — ""What You Don't Do"" and ""Unstoppable"" — as well as ""Forget,"" from her first album. She and her talented collaborators, James Wyatt on piano and Frida Mariama Touray on backing vocals, rehearsed this special arrangement during the sound check just moments before the performance. It's wonderfully intimate, with just guitar accompanied by vocals that embellish without getting in the way. If you're like me, you will never get enough.

Blood is available now.

F6j49uzPugA,The Internet: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"September 29, 2015 by TIMMHOTEP AKU 
The Internet is both an anomaly and a sign of the times. No, I'm not talking about the actual Internet you're using to read this text (though that Internet is pretty special, too), I'm talking about the L.A. band featuring founding members Syd The Kid (vocals/production) and Matt Martians (keys/ production), as well as Pat Paige (bass), Jameel Bruner (keys) and Chris Smith (drums).

The band might just be the oddest thing to come from Odd Future, the collective known for its irreverence — and, of course, for making hip-hop. The Internet doesn't stand out from the rest of Odd Future because of any over-the-top antics, but because they make great R&B music. Beautiful, textured, enveloping R&B. Sure, the swagger of hip-hop is apparent in Syd's songwriting and the swing of the beats, but that doesn't mean it's adulterated — theirs is some of the most refreshing neo-soul to come out in years, and it's created by a band whose members were small children or not even born when the subgenre came to be in the mid- to late '90s. That's where the sign-of-the-times part comes in; while some decry the death of musicianship at the hands of samplers, drum machines and computer programs, we need look no further than the L.A. band for evidence to the contrary.

Seeing is believing, so the band stopped by NPR's D.C. offices for a Tiny Desk performance that'll give you a taste of the new Ego Death and a song from 2013's Feel Good. Watch the performance and put your Internet service to good use.

VATGBUBkrUc,Joan Shelley: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"As technology rules the sound of the day, it's good to be reminded how powerfully a single voice can transmit deep emotion. Joan Shelley made one of the most beautiful records of the year with just her voice and two guitars. Over and Even has roots in British folk, the sort made popular by artists like Sandy Denny and Fairport Convention in the late '60s and early '70s — another time when the dominant music was filled with electricity and texture. The intertwined melodies Shelley and her guitar partner Nathan Salsburg (who's had his own Tiny Desk Concert) produce are refreshing breaths of Kentucky air in a world of compressed drums and overly processed vocals. This one is near and dear to my heart.

sRZi4QQEGBI,Gina Chavez: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"September 22, 2015 by FELIX CONTRERAS
Much has happened for Gina Chavez since I first saw her at an unofficial SXSW showcase about five years ago: two albums, fan and industry recognition, this year's Austin Music Award for Austin Musician Of The Year. Chavez's music has developed over the years, just as it should.

What hasn't changed is the intense openness and warmth of her performances. From that hot spring afternoon in Austin to this recent Tiny Desk Concert, it always feels as if she's performing just for me. And, of course, you get the sense that everyone else in the audience feels the same. See for yourself, and if you don't know her already, I dare you to walk away and not become a fan.

qQ4PZVj66ac,Watkins Family Hour: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"September 15, 2015 by BOB BOILEN 
The Watkins Family Hour began a dozen or so years ago as a way for a group of friends to get together and play old and new tunes. For Sean and Sara Watkins, it served as a monthly bit of magic: a musical variety show filled with extraordinary talent in the world of folk, bluegrass and beyond at L.A.'s famous Largo.

Now, the Watkins siblings — known for their work in Nickel Creek, among many other projects — have taken their fiddle, guitar and charm on a country-flavored yellow brick road, gathering friends and surprises along the way. For this tour and their Tiny Desk Concert, their biggest surprise is the addition of Fiona Apple as a guest vocalist who actually yowls along to songs like the traditional tune ""In The Pines.""

YcHL0kUFPhw,Chris Stapleton: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"September 14, 2015 by JACOB GANZ 
As a songwriter in Nashville, Chris Stapleton has written hits for Kenny Chesney, George Strait and Darius Rucker. As a singer, he once led the bluegrass band The SteelDrivers, and more recently stepped into the solo spotlight with Traveller, his debut album. It's the kind of country record that gets better the more you wear it in: When NPR Music named it one of our favorite albums of the first half of 2015, critic Ann Powers compared it to a ""soft denim jacket ... pulled out time after time, lending comfort, suiting every occasion, with treasure stuffed in every pocket.""

It's easy to understand why other singers took to his songs — Stapleton writes lyrics that sound classic but never dated — but his softly creaking voice gives them the home they deserve. And even though those songs stand plenty well on their own, it's nice to have a little support. When Stapleton stepped behind the Tiny Desk to play selections from Traveller, he was joined by his wife Morgane on harmony vocals. Between patient, detailed songs of devotion to love, Los Angeles and liquor, they paused for banter about the summer heat in D.C. and the large number of guitars Chris owns (""Not supposed to tell that part,"" he said to Morgane).

Watch him hide behind a large hat, a beard and a battered vintage guitar; watch her smile at him during ""More Of You"" with a combination of admiration and affection. Like the songs themselves, their performance is full of private moments worth sharing widely.

Traveller is available now. (iTunes) (Amazon)

x1mSr92dBfg,Sam Lee: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"September 11, 2015 by ANASTASIA TSIOULCAS
English vocalist Sam Lee has an amazing backstory: He found his way to singing professionally after stints as a naturalist and a burlesque dancer. But what really matters are his mesmerizing performances, as well as his incredible ability to connect with people — certainly with the audience in front of him, but also with the elders he's sought out to learn these songs.

Lee has dedicated himself to preserving centuries-old folk songs of the U.K. and Ireland, particularly from ""outsider"" communities like the Roma (Gypsies) and the Scottish and Irish Travelers. But he and his bandmates — ukulele player and vocalist Jon Whitten, violinist and vocalist Flora Curzon, and percussionist and vocalist Josh Green — put these ancient songs in thoroughly 21st-century arrangements that feel creative, fresh and surprising, but also deeply human.

Above it all, Lee's voice blazes through with strength, clarity and confidence. This is an artist who has found his destiny as a singer, a folk-song collector and a steward of stories, keeping them alive and relevant for a new generation.

C_oACPWGvM4,Leon Bridges: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"September 08, 2015 by BOB BOILEN

We probably should have shot this Tiny Desk Concert in black-and-white. Listening to Leon Bridges, I hear a sound with its heart and soul rooted in 1962. There's purity in his voice that's unadorned, untouched and unaffected by 21st-century pop. It's just soul.

Still, the songs from this 26-year-old Fort Worth singer feel refreshing in the context of the day. Surely there's touches of Sam Cooke's spiritual sound, but Leon Bridges has a way of making the familiar feel adventurous and new. It may be because this is all new to him. He only picked up the guitar around the age of twenty and only began listening to classic soul music after friends told him he sounded like R&B musicians from long ago. What Leon Bridges has tapped into on his debut album with fellow Fort Worth musicians including Austin Jenkins from White Denim is a universal sound, an undeniably heartfelt sound which transcends age, race and musical tastes. He's easy to love and tough to resist and his performance at the Tiny Desk with his fabulous band is a testament to what it means to sing from the heart.

Y-8cvt3y-NM,Happyness: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"September 04, 2015 by BOB BOILEN
If you're a fan of dark, incredibly dry, wry humor, you've just found Happyness. In 2014, I first heard the band sing these words on a stage in New York City, from the song ""Montreal Rock Band Somewhere"":

I'm wearing Win Butler's hair

There's a scalpless singer

With a Montreal rock band somewhere

And he's all right

With such perverse, funny imagery, Londoners Benji Compston, Jonny Allan and Ash Cooper spin tales that often fire up a cartoon question mark in my head. But at the same time, I'm grooving to their strangely jazzy pop sounds.

In their longest Tiny Desk tune, ""Weird Little Birthday Girl,"" I'm reminded of Wilco — maybe the sound from around A Ghost Is Born, with all the long, repetitive phrases — but Happyness doesn't build its songs to a frenzy the way that band might. Instead, they enchant and lull, only snapping me out of my dream state with their constant quirkiness. Happyness' members sang all three of these songs through a palm-sized guitar amp, which made their voices that much creepier.

It's a weird little song

She's a weird little girlfriend

We don't really get along

That creepiness is endearing, though, as you'll hear in their banter as they tune and switch instruments between songs. They deserve their own musical-comedy show, honestly, and it would fall somewhere between stand-up gags and eerie calm. I'd be happy with that.

0lNFHD0lUAQ,Mitski: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"August 31, 2015by BOB BOILEN

Watching Mitski perform at my desk, there are moments when I was worried for her. In her opening song, ""Townie,"" the boys ""are driving and they'll be drinking"" — and a verse later, Mitski sings of love in ways that feel vengeful, not fruitful.

And I want a love that falls as fast

As a body from the balcony, and

I want a kiss like my heart is hitting the ground

I'm holding my breath with a baseball bat

Though I don't know what I'm waiting for

I am not gonna be what my daddy wants me to be

Moments later, she holds her guitar high with her mouth close to the pickup, which acts like a microphone as she screams to her mother for help:

Mom, would you wash my back?

This once, and then we can forget

And I'll leave what I'm chasing

For the other girls to pursue

Mom, am I still young?

Can I dream for a few months more?

Then, she closes with a song of dying in the hope of leaving a tidy room and being well-regarded when they come get her things. If it all sounds depressing, it is, but the glimmer of beauty comes in her smile and laugh at the end of her set. It's part nerves, part angst, and it all makes for a heartfelt performance sans filters: That's why Mitski Miyawaki is such an incredible performer. At night, at a club with the lights down and drinks in hand, it can be more pensive for all — more thought-provoking. But here in an office, the starkness somehow makes her music even scarier.

Xmal7_hGOz0,Eskimeaux: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"August 28, 2015 by BOB BOILEN
Eskimeaux's OK is easily my most played album of the year, next to the Courtney Barnett record. There's lighthearted, almost childlike beauty in the way Gabrielle Smith puts words to song. Here are OK's first lines:

In my dreams you're a bathtub running

You are warm and tender

And bubbling

Oh, you are cold and bristling and struggling

As an adopted child, Smith discovered that her biological father is Tlingit Eskimo; she describes the -eaux suffix as ""just a playful jumble of letters that represents the way I record — a confusing layering of sounds that somehow coalesce into something simple.""

Smith has performed at the Tiny Desk before: She's part of a New York art collective that includes Told Slant, Small Wonder and Bellows, and Bellows played here not too long ago. Some of the players in those bands sing with Smith in her final song — one of my favorite songs of the year — called ""I Admit I'm Scared,"" which ends with a few perfectly chosen words:

And if I had a dime for every time I'm freaking out

We could fly around the world

Or just get out of your parents' house

EnYBuPmwXuc,Caroline Rose: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"August 24, 2015 by BOB BOILEN 
Caroline Rose plays music as if she's just met her new best friend: It's fresh, fun and performed with contagious enthusiasm. The title of the first song she played at the Tiny Desk — ""Yip Yip Yow"" — hints at the fun to come in this brief, blazing set.

Rose's music is inspired by rockabilly, fast country and traveling from town to town in a van. And, though this set might seem like little more than a fun romp, it's worth pointing out the T-shirt over her left shoulder that reads ""F*** Fear."" It's an attitude her band wears well and fine-tunes in ""I Will Not Be Afraid."" So tie your saddle shoes tight and rock.

7R35_SvWFKY,Son Lux: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"August 21, 2015 by ROBIN HILTON

Most of the bands that play the Tiny Desk strip down their sound to accommodate the limited space and unconventional acoustics of an office. But Son Lux chose to do the exact opposite. Normally a trio of guitar, drums and keys based out of New York, the band blew up its sound for this performance, adding off-duty, civilian horn players from the United States Marine Band.

In spite of the more elaborate production — and extra decibels — Son Lux still made the performance intimate, in part by peeling back the otherwise-complex layers of each song and drawing out the most essential elements, particularly frontman Ryan Lott's voice. Known in part for his fragile falsetto, Lott belts out the vocals here like he's delivering power ballads.

At the Tiny Desk, the group focused entirely on Son Lux's latest album, Bones, opening with ""You Don't Know Me"" and following with ""Now I Want."" It closed with the gorgeous and moving ""Your Day Will Come."" Throughout the performance, Lott intermittently conducts the group as it dissects simple four-four time signatures into ever smaller slices, intentionally landing on the off beats. It's one of Son Lux's trademark devices for live sets, and it helps keep the audience from getting too comfortable.

Bones was released earlier this summer on Glassnote. It's Son Lux's fourth full-length album. The band is currently on a European tour through the fall.

w1hiwVawMb4,Restorations: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"August 14, 2015 by LARS GOTRICH • 
Restorations' LP3 was a gorgeous, vulnerable and big-hearted rock and roll record with three electric guitars dialed to the lump in your throat. A year since its release, these introspective anthems about self-doubt and uncertainty still ring true and take on a whole new power live.

Fearing for the safety of the Beatles and Devo figurines perched on the wall of the Tiny Desk, those complex, decibel-shattering arrangements are stripped down to a few guitars and a MiniKorg. Jon Loudon's gravelly voice is major presence on Restorations records, and doesn't tone anything down here, shouting down the climactic chorus of ""Separate Songs"" and joined by his bandmates in three-part harmony for ""The Future.""

Q4awAmiZj50,Torres: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"August 10, 2015 by BOB BOILEN
Mackenzie Scott's quiet early music gave hints that she could get loud, but I still wasn't prepared for the ferocity of her new work. Recording as Torres, she spends her new album Sprinter unleashing as-yet-unheard intensity and power, all while performing with incredible prowess.

Sprinter is the album that taught me to love Torres' music: It channels clear influences like Patti Smith and PJ Harvey, while still hinting at further growth. (She's only 24.)

Her band is extraordinary, too. Guitarist Cameron Kapoor provides a perfect level of controlled noise under Scott's alternately melodic and aggressive playing, while Erin Manning contributes haunting harmonies and drummer Dominic Cipolla provides spacious punctuation. All of which made for a perfect storm, right in NPR's offices.

hNw5kna518E,Terence Blanchard: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"When he started to make the music that appears on his new album, trumpeter Terence Blanchard wasn't thinking of Eric Garner, Michael Brown or any of the other recent high-profile police killings of African-Americans. He was thinking of desired collaborators: Donald Ramsey, a bassist and high-school classmate; Oscar Seaton, a drummer with whom he'd worked on film projects; Fabian Almazan, the pianist of his other band; and Charles Altura, a guitarist he'd encountered online. And he was thinking about a sound different from the left-center jazz quintet he leads: something overtly funky, with electric bass and guitar and processing and human voices and dance grooves.

As the E-Collective came together — both as a band and in terms of its repertoire — it took on another guiding light. Blanchard, no stranger to political statements, saw the music as an opportunity to speak out on current events he was unable to ignore, especially as a black man. The eventual recording came to be a commentary on the treatment of minorities by American law enforcement, in the vein of the #blacklivesmatter movement. The album's title references Eric Garner's last words, ""I can't breathe""; it's called Breathless.

The heavy and the party recently came together for a week-long run at a jazz club in D.C., though the mood was much more on the party side when the E-Collective stopped at NPR headquarters. The mood was relaxed and jovial from the time the group stepped into the lobby, with Englishman Chris Bailey supplying plenty of backbeats on our house drum set — though there was a moment toward the end of the set when Blanchard casually explained the project, setting up a lyrical, almost elegiac solo. This music was a modern update on jazz fusion, sure, but also one where we dance to ward off despair.

saT8AUI7RyU,SOAK: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"August 03, 2015 by BOB BOILEN
The opening line of SOAK's debut album — ""A teenage heart is an unguided dart"" — contains the first words I heard from 19-year-old singer-songwriter Bridie Monds-Watson. Now, she's bringing that fragile, pure, thickly Irish-accented voice to the Tiny Desk.

Before We Forgot How To Dream, SOAK's debut, is one of my favorite albums of 2015. Monds-Watson's songs are about growing up and trying to understand adults and friends and life; though they're quiet, they aren't dour. They can be funny and smart, atmospheric and delicate — so much more than might be expected from a lone Irish teenager with an acoustic guitar.

2fIJPxCjlPk,Shamir: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"July 31, 2015 by BOB BOILEN
When I first saw Shamir at NPR Music's SXSW showcase, the 20-year-old singer popped on stage with a Yo Gabba Gabba T-shirt and proceeded to light up the night with his disco-infused funk and joyful energy.

Cut to this Tiny Desk Concert. Shamir Bailey is sitting alone on a stool with an acoustic guitar — hardly recognizable except perhaps for the green painted fingernails, until he began to sing. At that point, he put his fragile but confident countertenor to work in ""Darker,"" from his debut album Ratchet, and I knew we were in for something special.

During sound check, Shamir seemed so lonely sitting on a stool — especially after I'd seen him play with a big band — so I invited our audience of NPR staffers, interns and friends to gather around him, campfire style. His charm is undeniable: When tells the story of writing ""Demon"" while working in the fitting room at Ross, I think we all just wanted to give him a hug.

HaVsSRXBH78,Paul Weller: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"July 28, 2015 by BOB BOILEN
There's a reason Paul Weller is so respected by his fans despite his shifts in musical styles over the years. Weller follows his heart and his tunes stay true to the times and his age. I first heard him in 1977, when I bought a British import of a 45 and later an album called In The City by The Jam. Inspired by The Who, the music of The Jam was infused with urgency and melody. Then Weller wanted more from music and began The Style Council with a bit of R&B, ballads and even jazz. For nearly 25 years, Weller has been recording under his own name. Now he has new songs for us all and an album called Saturns Pattern. Here at the Tiny Desk he brings this humble collection of songs acoustically and includes a tune from what may be his best known record, his 1995 album Stanley Road. It's a pretty heartwarming moment — especially for longtime followers of his shifting but consistent music.

Xqd86is7y54,Kate Tempest: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"July 21, 2015 by BOB BOILEN
Warning: Kate Tempest will connect you with your emotions and the cold, callous world around you. You may cry.

Of all the artists I saw at SXSW this year, Tempest was the one I'll never forget. The London hip-hop artist, playwright and poet speaks with a clarity and honesty unencumbered by code or lingo, with stories that cut to the very heart of how we try to survive and embrace our time on Earth. At the Tiny Desk, she jumps straight into the fire with a spoken-word story of a soldier that looks at both the bravery and horror of conflict and war. She honesty left few eyes dry. And it's not simply her intent to make us weepy, she just understands the importance of us, her audience, and deems it the only imperative to connect with those in a room. She did that here at NPR; I wasn't the only one with tears. And then there are her songs, filled with stories and characters from her album Everybody Down that deal with love in a time of adversity. Intense and heartfelt — enjoy and beware.

Everybody Down is available on iTunes and Amazon.

pCGUsORIHhM,Songhoy Blues: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"July 14, 2015 by BOB BOILEN •
The music I feel most connected to beyond rock is from Mali. The melodies are so fluid, so elegant and most of all so trance-inducing. It often sits on one chord and notes played revolve around that chord. It can feel like a drone at times, and in the case of Songhoy Blues it rocks, lulls and the percussion grooves are not only trance-inducing but dance-inducing.

Many of the musicians we know from Mali are in exile, driven out by Islamists threatening musicians and kidnapping them; the members of Tinariwen know this firsthand. There is sadness, defiance and celebration in the music Songhoy Blues brought to the Tiny Desk from a record called Music in Exile, which is co-produced by an artist most of us rock lovers know best from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Nick Zinner. Rock and the desert blues, already closely connected in attitude and sound, fuse nicely with his touch — and can be felt in blissful rawness here.

Girlpool's Cleo Tucker and Harmony Tividad perform in unison: They play their guitars that way — Tucker on lead, Tividad on bass — and they sing the same angsty, funny words simultaneously, or as if emulating a nursery-rhyme-style round, a la ""Row Row Row Your Boat.""

The duo has made one of my favorite albums of the year so far, Before The World Was Big, which followed a self-titled debut EP from 2014. Girlpool's words deal with the pedestrian, the mundane and the beauty locked away in both. In 10 songs and 24 minutes, the charming, talented performers find their strength in essence, without drums or unnecessary rock trappings. The ingredients require no cooking and are served strictly raw, with one caveat: If it's good, double it.

After spending time with Christopher Paul Stelling's third album, Labor Against Waste, I expected a certain intensity to his performance. But I didn't expect him to nearly implode behind my desk, as the fierceness of his heartfelt songs was set against deft fingerpicking on his beat-to-hell '64 Gibson gut-string classical guitar. That guitar, bought in Asheville, looks like a well-worn friend, with its dark bruised wood and his initials hand-carved into its body. Stelling marked the instrument a year after he bought it, when he made New York City his home in 2007.

By the time he played ""Horse,"" his third song at the Tiny Desk, Stelling seemed overtaken by the song he wrote. Watch him lean in as if he's about to lunge, his eyes bugged out, sometimes rolled back in his head revealing just the whites, skin blood-red, voice like a preacher on fire. His music feels undeniable: Best witnessed live, it's steeped in tradition yet filled with vitality, immediacy and soul — all the reasons worth discovering someone new.

88_jAJ-MduU,Oddisee: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"June 26, 2015 | SURAYA MOHAMED -- Amir Elkhalifa, a.k.a. Oddisee, is an emergent standout in hip-hop. The Prince Georges County, Md., native says he made his new album, The Good Fight, as a reminder that music comes before hip-hop; that music can trigger indescribable feelings; that music is a meditation on our capacity to love; and, finally, that our ambition and greed are in constant conflict with our sense of propriety.

Simply put, Oddisee's music is genius. He creates just the right amount of space, allowing it to breathe with perfectly timed cadences and vamps. His deceptively intricate rhythm tracks interlock with complementary harmonies and brilliantly constructed bars in ways that appeal to both diehard hip-hop heads — those who decipher and analyze lyrics as a hobby — and those who just want a clutch beat. He's got it all.

iFGnkbZ3fLE,Hop Along: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"June 22, 2015 by LARS GOTRICH
Let's talk about Frances Quinlan's voice for a moment. In ""Horseshoe Crab,"" she whispers with a rasp that feels small, yet embodies the fears we try not to name; then, she throws her head back to ask, ""Who is gonna talk trash long after I'm gone?"" That gut-punching howl shatters like a plate on a concrete floor.

Quinlan's singular voice is the focus, but not what ultimately completes Hop Along, a guitar-based rock band that messes with the soft-loud dynamic in busy and urgent arrangements that cull from their experiences in punk, hard rock and Americana groups. At the NPR Music offices, Hop Along plays songs from its new album Painted Shut, with guitarist Joe Reinhart swapping an electric for an acoustic, giving the band a country-tinged Nashville feel — especially in the punchy, poppy closer, ""Sister Cities.""

6I7u1bcE_MM,Strand Of Oaks: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"June 19, 2015 by BOB BOILEN • Strand Of Oaks' music is filled with bite and sometimes regret, but also a good deal of warmth. Neil Young is an obvious touchstone when the loud guitar solos kick in, but so is Jason Molina. In fact, the late Ohio singer-songwriter was the subject of the song that became my hook into the music of Strand Of Oaks; it's a song Timothy Showalter sings here at the Tiny Desk that can also be found on his 2014 album HEAL; it's called ""JM.""

I was an Indiana kid, gettin' no one in my bed

I had your sweet tunes to play

I was staring at the map, feeling fire in my head

I had your sweet tunes to play

I was mean to my dad, 'cause I was mean to myself

I had your sweet tunes to play

Stealing smokes in my car, with the windows way down

I had your sweet tunes to play, your sweet tunes to play

Showalter's words and life experiences — a bad relationship, a house that burned down — suggest a dark, even bitter, undercurrent. But when he drove alone in his van down from Philly and arrived at NPR here in D.C., he popped out after his drive with a warm smile and three guitars, one for each of the songs he'd play. We quickly bonded in the parking garage over our identical buckled Frye boots and love for vintage synthesizers. He turned out to be a sweetheart, and hearing these amazing songs with just him and a guitar was a treat to behold.

PtlDvF6f1sQ,The Prettiots: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concerts,"June 15, 2015 by BOB BOILEN • 
The Prettiots' songs are winsome and clever, but most of all they're honest and funny. Goodness knows pop music needs some clever fun.

The three women in The Prettiots — Kay Kasparhauser on ukulele and lead vocals, Rachel Trachtenburg from the Trachtenburg Family Slideshow Players on drums, and bassist Lulu Prat — share their love of everything from Law & Order to old-school girl groups like the Shangri-Las. Their song ""Stabler,"" performed here, is based on Kasparhauser's infatuation with the Law & Order character Elliot Stabler.

""Boys (I Dated In High School)"" is the Prettiots tune that first charmed me, thanks mainly to the perfect portrait its brainy rhymes paint:

Martin, that was your name

I met you on the 1 train

You were super duper duper hot

On the 1 train

You said you were a painter

Mostly you were a waiter

A stoner and a skater

So I had to say later,

These are the boys that I dated in high school

I thought they were so nice

And I thought they were so cool

These are the boys that I dated in high school

They weren't very nice

And they weren't very cool

It's the sort of music you'll either adore or abhor; it's hard to be neutral and you'll know it quickly. For me, their appearance at the Tiny Desk totally made my day.

mA3Qw3KiEtk,Anna & Elizabeth: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Anna & Elizabeth are almost single-handedly resurrecting the ""crankie."" If, like me, you didn't know what a ""crankie"" was, it's like a mural on a spool — each drawn and crafted to be hand-cranked and unfurled at the pace of a song. The effect, as experienced here in ""Lella Todd Crankie,"" is breathtaking.

Anna Roberts-Gevalt and Elizabeth LaPrelle are story-gatherers and storytellers. They came to NPR and brought many of us to tears with some of the most yearning harmonies I've heard at the Tiny Desk. These songs are given few embellishments — sometimes a fiddle is added to a single voice, sometimes a banjo or guitar chimes in — but always the power is in the sparseness. If you've never thought your tastes would lean to mountain music, take a deep breath and soak it all in.

EZ4Hum70sTk,Genevieve: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"It's often true that the songs we wind up loving most are the ones that surprise us. I'm not a pop music lover, not a lover of songs with obvious hooks, so when I heard the big fat chorus that starts off Genevieve's ""Colors,"" I thought, ""uh-oh."" What wound up drawing me in first was her voice — powerful with a tiny bit of rasp and a sweet smile in her phrasing. And then that perfectly positive message, worded in a way that gave me chills:
""Your life is your design, so go ahead design it. Your star is in the sky, so go ahead align it. Cause you're forever lost until you go and find it.""
The truth in those words needed to be shouted from rooftops and that chorus, that hooky thing that generally is my turnoff, became a giant turn-on. Then I went and saw Genevieve perform on a sunny day outdoors in Austin. That SXSW performance gave me a new glimpse of her talent, especially the many ways she could sing, all with great conviction. So I invited her to my desk and she came armed not with the band she had in Austin but simply with an accompanist, Chris Faller, and her voice. To anyone in that room — and for you watching this Tiny Desk — her promise is undeniable.

4-v1CKP4khE,Frank Fairfield: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"They came to the Tiny Desk a bit groggy, having been up late playing music in the hotel the night before. It's what Frank Fairfield and his friends Tom Marion and Zac Sokolow do when they're together. And the music they make is casual and mostly hand-me-down songs from well before Fairfield was born nearly 30 years ago. These old timey marches, polkas and mountain tunes course through Fairfield's veins — you can hear it in his spellbinding voice, his fluid fiddle playing, his warm-toned banjo picking and even as he plucks bass lines on a cello. He's learned his tunes listening to 78s and hanging around older guys like Marion, a man of few words and lots of effortless mandolin melodies. It's as close as we might get to days gone by without feeling nostalgic, simply happy we have Frank Fairfield to brighten this tiny day. --  BOB BOILEN

k0nyFpcQl-Y,Madisen Ward And The Mama Bear: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"There's sweetness to Madisen Ward And The Mama Bear's music that makes me smile, and then there's so much more. I first saw the Kansas City mother-and-son duo perform last fall in Nashville's Blue Room, a small, perfect-sounding stage at Third Man Records. The bluesy roots of the music suited the space, and the sound — with young Madisen Ward's powerful, quivering voice backed by his mother Ruth — had a homespun feel. But there's vitality to the pair's music that kept it from feeling like a throwback or a gimmick. I immediately set out to get them to the Tiny Desk.

Now, eight months later, the Wards have released their first album, released the day we recorded this concert. Their heartfelt Tiny Desk set features some playful banter, while the songs themselves are memorable and singable even days after you hear them. In all, it's a perfect introduction to a one-of-a-kind duo.

v-xghWkpqmU,Jason Vieaux And Yolanda Kondonassis: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"We rarely invite Tiny Desk alumni back to the confines of Bob Boilen's work space, but we couldn't resist this time. Harpist Yolanda Kondonassis and Grammy-winning guitarist Jason Vieaux have both given solo Tiny Desk performances. Since then they've paired up for concerts and a new album of works composed especially for their combination of instruments.

Although the harp and guitar are both instruments you pluck and strum, they seem to come from different corners of the classical world. The guitar conjures up the legacy of zesty Spanish music while the harp must contend with the cliché of its angelic role in the orchestra. But when Kondonassis and Vieaux are together, the two instruments seem to merge into a singularly evocative voice. Kondonassis joked that they could call it a ""guitarp"" until someone quickly Googled and told us there actually is such a contraption.

Music for harp and guitar isn't easy to come by, so Kondonassis and Vieaux have been busy commissioning works like the opening ""Elysian,"" part of a larger suite written for the duo by Gary Schocker.

Anything that sounds even vaguely non-Western is a good fit for the duo because most cultures enjoy their own versions of the harp and guitar. Alan Hovhaness, an American composer with a global outlook, weaved Asian ideas into his Sonata for Harp and Guitar, subtitled ""Spirit of Trees."" And the duo ends by beating out the interlocking rhythms of the African candombe, which Argentine composer Máximo Diego Pujol placed in his Suite mágica. --  TOM HUIZENGA

HGQzhcEOl4M,Young Fathers: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"They've made music together since they were young teens, coming together in Edinburgh from places as far apart as Ghana and Maryland. Young Fathers' hip-hop-infused poetry is intense; you can hear that on the group's new album, White Men Are Black Men Too.

Translating that intensity was a challenge for Young Fathers at the Tiny Desk. Full-on drums and electronics weren't going to happen on this day, so the group's members chose another path — a quieter, more contemplative path — and just two songs made the cut, spanning only four minutes. It's a brief but powerful introduction to their poetry and their possibilities. -- BOB BOILEN

BDUwGCHA2b0,Camané: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Great fado singers sound as if they carry the weight of the world's sadness. They don't just wear their hearts on their sleeves — they bare their souls.

Fado, which means ""fate"" in Portuguese, emerged from the gritty barrios and docks of Lisbon in the early 19th century and has evolved in fascinating ways. Think of it as the Portuguese blues. The songs aren't just sad. They flow with an ineffable mix of longing, loss and melancholy, framed in resignation. It's a kind of glad-to-be-unhappy feeling the Portuguese and Brazilians call saudade.

Camané, with his silky baritone, can emote with the best of them, but never takes it over the top. This voice, with its volume and sheer beauty, springing from this small-framed man is something to behold.

Camané, whose full name is Carlos Manuel Moutinho Paiva dos Santos Duarte, got hooked on fado by listening to his parents' record collection. He began singing as a teenager and has emerged as a shining star of his generation, a standout male singer in a genre dominated by women. As for his success, Camané has sold six million albums in his home country. There are about 10.5 million people living in Portugal. You do the math.

One last thing: An important ingredient in fado's recipe for melancholy is the rich, tinkling sound of Portuguese guitar. It goes far beyond simple accompaniment. With its twelve steel strings strung in double courses, the instrument not only comments on the text but also enters into a type of heartfelt dialogue with the singer. Pay attention to José Manuel Neto's performance here — with nuance and charm it has the power to transport you to a cozy little tavern in the Alfama district of Lisbon. --TOM HUIZENGA

6e3bV26nRF0,Bellows: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Bellows' debut album, Blue Breath, was among my Top 20 records of last year. What sets Bellows apart from thousands of other guitar-bass-drums bands out there is its heart. Oliver Kalb sings about things that matter to him in ways that matter to me. His sing-song, matter-of-fact phrasing and guitar melodies are memorable, and the harmonies are lovely, with the staying power to drift in my head for days on end.

I first heard Bellows when I went to see another Brooklyn band, Eskimeaux; the two share many members in live performance, and both belong to an artist collective known as The Epoch. It's a thrill to share these enchanting songs with a wider audience.-- BOB BOILEN

j-Oc7NQqEjI,Eskmo: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"We met at a ping-pong party in Iceland. Brendan Angelides introduced himself as a musician and friend of Jónsi and Alex Somers, who were hosting the party. When I came home from the Iceland Airwaves music festival, I listened to the music Angelides makes under the name Eskmo, and was intrigued.

His current record, SOL, is mysterious, but I wondered how a Tiny Desk Concert would work, as buttons getting pushed and sliders sliding don't always make for a compelling performance. But when Eskmo told me he wanted to use available objects to make his music, I knew we were in for some surprises. Which is how plywood shelving from the Tiny Desk, water bottles and a Paul McCartney doll head became percussion instruments in the hands of a man who's part musician, part magician.

SiDBiIsFiqU,Vijay Iyer Trio: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Vijay Iyer is probably best known as a pianist and bandleader in the African-American creative improvisational tradition — most say ""jazz"" for short — though he's also several other things in music. He's a composer of chamber, large ensemble and mixed-media works; a Harvard professor; a student of Indian classical music; a father and New York City resident. Committed as he is to multiplicity, there's one place you can see many of his interests distilled at once: the trio he's led for nearly a dozen years.

The long-standing relationship he's forged with Stephan Crump (bass) and Marcus Gilmore (drums) accommodates all sorts of risk and translates into reward. The three play daring games of rhythmic interaction. They take Iyer's pieces designed for strings or big band and reduce without losing vitality. They do John Coltrane and Thelonious Monk, Flying Lotus and M.I.A.

The morning after a gig in Washington, D.C., the trio got up to visit NPR headquarters before a noon train back to New York. (There was a lot of espresso involved.) In one continuous performance, Iyer, Crump and Gilmore treated us to a few pieces from Iyer's deep catalog, including two from the new album Break Stuff — ending on the scintillating ""Hood,"" inspired by pioneering Detroit techno DJ Robert Hood. After the blaze of the main set, they played a calm and pretty theme dedicated to the late poet and activist Amiri Baraka – it originally came Iyer's suite for string quartet and piano Time, Place, Action. There's excitement, daring, overload, and speed in Vijay Iyer's music, but, as we were reminded: Just like anyone else, he looks for beauty too.--PATRICK JARENWATTANANON

Ag-OIlEN00M,José González: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"There's a quiet and a calm from José González that amplify his words. This has never been truer than on his new album, Vestiges & Claws. The songs are full of abstract imagery — more paintings than stories. He performed this song, ""With The Ink of A Ghost,"" at my desk.

Idle as a wave
Moving out at sea
Cruising without sound
Molding what's to be
Serene between the trace
Serene with the tide and ink of a ghost

González is a 36 year old singer from Gothenburg, Sweden. You may have also heard Junip, his noisier band. But here, with a small group, the music is spacious, somewhat sensual. His classical guitar chords are melodic, the harmonies adventurous, his voice soothing. These are his first new solo songs in seven years and this soft-spoken, warmhearted singer left an imprint at the Tiny Desk that was gentle and long lasting. I only hope it's not seven more years before he brings us more new songs.-- BOB BOILEN

The creative quartet from Kiev, Ukraine make music that sounds like nothing I've ever heard, with strands of everything I've ever heard. There are rhythms that sound West African and drone that feels as if it could have emanated from India or Australia. At times, DakhaBrakha is simply a rock band whose crazy homeland harmonies are filled with joy. All the while, they play tight-knit tunes featuring accordion, drums, reeds and shakers while wearing tall, Marge Simpson-looking wool hats that made me jealous.

I want the world to see this Tiny Desk Concert more than any other right now. It's refreshing to hear the power of acoustic music and the many worlds of sound still waiting to be explored. -- BOB BOILEN

FA1TsteS7z0,Beach Slang: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"James Snyder writes songs as if he were in the room next door — hushed and vulnerable in his own space, but aware and perhaps even thrilled that someone might be listening. With Beach Slang, these uplifting confessionals become euphoric punk anthems about squeezing every second out of life. So it's telling and endearing that, when he played a solo acoustic set in the NPR Music offices, Snyder giggled with the nervous energy of a songwriter who's just been walked in on by a large group of strangers.

Last year, Beach Slang released a pair of 7"" EPs — Who Would Ever Want Anything So Broken? and Cheap Thrills On A Dead End Street — that immediately became the stuff of punk singalongs. On stage with a full band, lines like ""Kids like us are weird, and more, we're brave"" (from ""Filthy Luck"") and ""I get in trouble when things get quiet"" (from ""Dirty Cigarettes"") are drowned out by distortion. But here, they take on a raw character, as they reflect the search for courage amid loneliness.

Beach Slang is in the middle of making its debut album, which is sure to be full of dirty-yet-pretty punk songs. At the Tiny Desk, Snyder previews a new song called ""Too Late To Die Young,"" of which he says, ""This will be on that, supposing they (at Beach Slang's label) think it's good enough."" With just an acoustic guitar and Snyder's whispered rasp, he shakes as he sings, ""I swear, right now I'm all right."" It's quiet and elegiac now, but it's easy to imagine how the song will power through that uncertainty once Beach Slang plugs in.-- LARS GOTRICH

mi6uRT7PxTQ,Death Cab For Cutie: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Death Cab For Cutie came as a trio: Ben Gibbard sang, Nick Harmer played bass, and we wheeled in our piano for Zac Rae. This intimate set included two new songs — including ""Black Sun,"" the first single from their new album Kintsugi.

The album title refers to the Japanese art of reassembling broken pottery and making the breakage part of the newly formed pot. Death Cab For Cutie, a groundbreaking band formed in 1997, has gone through its own rebuilding of sorts. Chris Walla, a founding member of the band, has left, after contributing music to Kintsugi, but that's his farewell offering.

Death Cab For Cutie is still strongly defined by Gibbard's words, and that couldn't be more evident in this beautifully stark performance, which also includes ""No Room In Frame"" from Kintsugi, as well as two stripped-down favorites from the past. One, ""Your Heart Is An Empty Room,"" is from Plans, while a beautiful love song from Transatlanticism, ""Passenger Seat,"" moistened more than a few eyes in the crowd.

mhyD2qchkEw,Sylvan Esso: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"It's hard to believe that it hasn't quite been a year since the first Sylvan Esso album came out. The odd yet perfect marriage of Nick Sanborn's electronics with Amelia Meath's voice feels like a familiar friend by now. And yet seeing these songs performed softly — and captured in the light of day — made them feel fresh and lovable in new ways.

To keep things fresh and interesting, Sanborn brought a bunch of new gear to the Tiny Desk; it seemed a bit bewildering to him for a bit, but also inspiring. I think that's what makes this combination work so well: Meath and Sanborn inspire one another. You can see it in their eyes and in their smiles, and it comes out in their playing and dancing. It's enchanting music, performed wonderfully.-- BOB BOILEN

RWQChDfEJpI,Anonymous 4 With Bruce Molsky: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"It was December 1990 — more than a year before the first Anonymous 4 album was released — when NPR invited four slightly shy women into our studio to sing 13th-century Christmas music. Back then, we already knew the manifold beauty of their sound, its purity and accuracy, was something unique.

Now, some 25 years and 21 albums later, the a cappella vocal quartet is calling it quits at the end of 2015. But not before one final visit to NPR.

Original members Ruth Cunningham, Marsha Genensky and Susan Hellauer, plus Jacqueline Horner-Kwiatek, came bearing music from their new album, 1865, released to coincide with the 150th anniversary of the end of the Civil War. They brought along a gifted friend, singer, banjo player and fiddler Bruce Molsky, who also appears on the album. He's a keen choice of partner. Molsky's folksy baritone and his instrumental contributions provide a rustic foil to the crystalline tones of Anonymous 4, giving the songs a more authentic feel.

A sense of loss, a longing for home and general tough times are recurring themes in popular songs of the Civil War era. ""Listen to the Mocking Bird,"" from 1855, sports a jaunty beat but the protagonist dreams of ""sweet Hally"" and the mockingbird ""still singing o'er her grave."" In Stephen Foster's ""Hard Times Come Again No More,"" from one year earlier, we ""pause in life's pleasures"" but also ""count its many tears.""

And the most popular song of the age, ""Home, Sweet Home,"" originated in an English opera aria from 1823 with words by an American actor and poet. Accounts tell of Northern and Southern soldiers, across a battlefield or river, singing the tune together. The song's repeated affirmation, ""There's no place like home,"" (also Dorothy's mantra from The Wizard of Oz) is something that must resonate with the members of Anonymous 4 these days, as they get ever closer to hanging up the concert outfits and heading home themselves. -- TOM HUIZENGA

iXE_K2Kpoqc,Punch Brothers: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Spoiler alert: The Punch Brothers came to the Tiny Desk on Chris Thile's birthday. We made him a cake and gave him an NPR surprise! This wasn't the first time the brilliant mandolinist had brought a project to my desk — it was his fourth. The last time was with his longtime band Nickel Creek, but also with his new braces. So the cake we presented here was inscribed ""Brace Yourself Chris Happy Birthday."" He blew out the candles and then, along with this versatile and talented band, rocked our world.

Punch Brothers mixes the worlds of bluegrass, pop and classical. It's a tough combination to imagine, an even harder one to make work, but this band of fiddler, Gabe Witcher, Noam Pikelny on banjo, guitarist Chris Eldridge and bassist Paul Kowert make the unimaginable contagious and fun. They push boundaries and make music like no one else.

KPw-UZBnOO0,Matt Haimovitz & Christopher O'Riley: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Whether it's warranted or not, classical music wonks are perennially worried about the next generation of fans.

It seems there's less need to fret when you hear cellist Matt Haimovitz and pianist Christopher O'Riley. Some 15 years ago, they were already chipping away at the barriers — both real and perceived — between classical and pop.

Haimovitz played Bach in barrooms across America, and O'Riley (who hosts From The Top, NPR's classical radio show for young musicians) began including his own sophisticated transcriptions of songs by Radiohead and Elliott Smith in his recitals. On their double album Shuffle.Play.Listen., music by Stravinsky and Astor Piazzolla mingles with Cocteau Twins and Arcade Fire.

Comfortably ensconced behind Bob Boilen's desk, the duo plays a typically diverse set. The central work, ""The Orchard,"" is a collaboration between Philip Glass and West African composer Foday Musa Suso. It unfolds like a lullaby, as the piano's rocking bass line provides a mesmerizing foundation for the cello's wistful song high above. Surrounding it are lyricism and outbursts by Beethoven, from his Cello Sonata No. 4 (sounding distinctly 20th century), and a cinematic movement from Leoš Janáček's Pohádka, where heart-melting melodies clash with nervous energy. -- TOM HUIZENGA

iNqkT54EDBM,Aurelio Martinez: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Many tributaries follow the story of African migration to this part of the world. Much of that narrative is well-known, but little-known pockets of African culture still produce unique cultural expressions. The story of the Garifuna people is just one example.

A tapestry of cultures and influences can be heard in the guitar work of Aurelio Martinez in this Tiny Desk Concert. Accompanied by traditional Garifuna musicians and an electric guitar, Aurelio, as he is known, weaves together intricate layers of acoustic guitar to capture the polyrhythms of West African and the Caribbean. His words reflect the longing and pride for the Garifuna culture from his home along the Pacific coast of Honduras.

This is not museum music. This is living, breathing culture that is celebrated in Honduras and wherever else Afro-Latino descendants land in the so-called New World. Aurelio, his band and this music provide a fitting tribute to a nearly forgotten moment in history, keeping it alive for future generations. --  FELIX CONTRERAS

ymYjwsFz8iM,Fantastic Negrito: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"It says a lot that, with almost 7,000 entries to choose from, we selected Fantastic Negrito as the winner of our Tiny Desk Concert Contest. For his winning submission, he performed ""Lost In A Crowd"" in a freight elevator in Oakland. It was his passion, his voice and his backing band that landed him an invitation to perform behind my desk. We're proud of our choice.

As we learned after choosing him as our winner, Fantastic Negrito — a.k.a. Xavier Dphrepaulezz, pronounced dee-FREP-ah-lez — has a remarkable backstory. One of 15 children, he grew up in a strict home, and later signed a contract with Interscope Records in the '90s. That deal fell apart, though, and soured him on music-making. Then, a near-fatal car crash put him in a coma, and eventually left him without the proper use of his hands; he struggled with physical therapy for years to get some movement from what he now calls ""The Claw.""

These days, bolstered by a new outlook on life and music, he's reawakened and reemerged under the name Fantastic Negrito. You'll see that newly rediscovered purpose in his eyes and hear it in his voice, as he performs this Tiny Desk Concert with his fantastic band. -- BOB BOILEN

Phox is six friends from Baraboo, Wis., who make pretty, catchy music. The group's not-so-secret weapon is Monica Martin, who sings with a smoky lilt in front of spare, tasteful instrumentation.

You can hear that warm, accessible sound on Phox's 2014 debut, which was recorded at Wisconsin's April Base studio, built by Bon Iver's Justin Vernon and his brother. Touring has tightened this band since that off-the-cuff restaurant performance last year, as this marvelous performance at the Tiny Desk suggests. -- BOB BOILEN

I am likely to say it's the day Dan Deacon got the NPR staff worked up into a giant dance party! It's also the day Deacon and staff wheeled in an upright piano and connected it to his computer — a magical mix of old player piano and electronic avant-garde.

Yes, Deacon makes electronic music and dance music, but it's not the thump thump thump stuff you'd go to a club for. It's a mix of Brian Eno, Philip Glass and your kids' birthday party (if you were the cool parents your kids wished they had).

Dan came toting songs and that piano from his new record (which is quickly becoming my favorite of his), Gliss Riffer. The party really kicked into gear with the second song. And by the end you'll find me and my All Songs Considered co-host doing wild dance moves with 100 people. There'd never been a day at NPR quite like this!

Having seen her mostly with a big and powerful band, I wondered if this configuration would work. But it was magic, with the trombone poignantly complementing her mellifluous voice and stark personal words.

Zola Jesus is the work of Nika Roza Danilova. She has five albums that span and mix electronic music, classical and goth influences. She's always exploring unusual combinations, and this mix of trombone and voice provides just a glimpse into her eclectic explorations. If you find this intriguing and don't know Zola Jesus, you're in for an adventure as you explore her catalog, including her most recent album, Taiga.

tQ8a6hBoiFQ,Until The Ribbon Breaks: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"The beauty of the Tiny Desk lies, at least partially, in the limitations of size and technology. We rarely amplify voices, for example, so for a band like Until The Ribbon Breaks, the challenge becomes how to take a loud electronic sound down to a volume where singer Pete Lawrie-Winfield can be heard. In this case, the solution involved a spaghetti strainer, a paint bucket and an acoustic guitar.

It wasn't easy for Until The Ribbon Breaks to devise new arrangements for tried-and-true songs like ""Pressure,"" from its full-length debut A Lesson Unlearnt. But it worked, because the Cardiff band's dance beats are always secondary to strong melodies and songwriting.

Zw7DfFVga5Y,Mucca Pazza: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"When I first imagined Mucca Pazza at the Tiny Desk, I honestly had no idea how the Chicago band's 23 members would fit in — in the literal sense of the term. To load-test this performance, we actually gathered a gaggle of interns behind my desk and began to stack people on cabinets, step-stools and, of course, desks.

In nearly seven years of doing Tiny Desk Concerts, with more than 400 participating acts, this turned out to be the biggest one yet. It was also one of the most fun, with Mucca Pazza performing songs from its album L.Y.A. using trombones, saxophones, trumpets, woodwinds, violin, electric mandolin, accordion, cello, guitar, sousaphone, a big bass drum, percussion instruments and more. Then there were the cheerleaders.

I first heard this giant performance-art marching band at globalFEST 2013, and Mucca Pazza's mix of cacophony, symphony and crazed frolic makes it a large, lovable renegade. The band just celebrated its first 10 years together, so if you missed the first decade, prepare to be a fan of the next. You may even be tempted to join this circus.-- BOB BOILEN

f2rkstacMlg,John Reilly & Friends: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"It might be easy to dismiss a music project from actor John Reilly, but that would be a huge mistake: Reilly is a fine singer, especially when he gets a hold of old-time material, and his guitar work provides a perfect foundation for these church and porch tunes from America's past.

Reilly's eclectic choice of collaborators speaks to his passion and dedication: Tom Brosseau and Becky Stark are no strangers to folk tradition. Brosseau's striking voice was first heard on NPR in 2006 — he performed a Tiny Desk Concert of his own last year — while Stark is a performer and a singer known to many as Lavender Diamond. Her voice fits in sweetly between Reilly's and Brosseau's in a way that recalls her work in the country trio The Living Sisters. Rounding out this home-brewed acoustic affair is Andru Bemis on banjo and fiddle, as well as Soul Coughing's Sebastian Steinberg, who plays upright bass with finesse and humor.

So turn off the lights, blot out the distractions, light a candle or two, and let the glow — and the glow of your screen — transport you to country's past, when singers would all gather around a single mic. This is a band meant to play a Tiny Desk Concert. -- BOB BOILEN

QiR3qnG4Bf0,Bobby Bare Jr.: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"So I'm in Nashville, standing in line at a food/music festival ordering some kind of pulled pork bun when this guy behind me says hears my voice, recognizes me and says ""hey Bob Boilen...Bobby Bare Jr. here, I've been hoping to play your desk."" Truth be told I've been hoping to make that happen too...and so the deal was sealed over a pork bun. Thirty minutes later at the same festival Bobby's on stage with his dad the country legend Bobby Bare Sr. and Kings of Leon. Ah Nashville!

Bobby Bare Jr. is a sharp witted guy who pokes fun and makes fun. His love/hate relationship with Nashville comes from his life raised by two country singers and even his own name on a hit record at the age of eight. The Tiny Desk seemed a perfect place for his antics, just he and his as funny piano playin' sidekickin' mate, Matt Rowland. At times he sings about promising ""to get more famous friends"" when he hits ""The Big Time"" and poking fun at the staple of Nashville life, the music biz. The line 'You don't even need to sing on key, producers with computers can fix it all in Nashville, Tennessee"" is a line only songwriter and young Bobby's mentor Shel Silverstein could have delivered better.You don't have to like country music to love Bobby, just a love of human flaws and a love of laughter.--BOB BOILEN

KUnUv_395vY,Daniel Lanois: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"I came to know Daniel Lanois through his instrumental collaboration with Brian Eno, Apollo: Atmospheres And Soundtracks, in 1983. I fell in love with Lanois' own music through his singing and the heartfelt, textured songs on albums like 1989's lovely Acadie (with its New Orleans flavor) and 1993's For The Beauty Of Wynona (with its haunting sounds and stories). Most fans know Lanois as a remarkable producer for the likes of Bob Dylan, U2 and Peter Gabriel.

What Daniel Lanois brought to the Tiny Desk recalled that early work while still sounding new: He led an all-instrumental, somewhat improvisational trio based on the sort of studio processing for which he's become famous. In essence, he brought the studio out of the studio — with the aid of two great players, drummer Brian Blade and bassist Jim Wilson — and directly to my desk. The title of Lanois' new album, Flesh And Machine, describes the music well. He never says a word, but he sculpts some serious, hypnotic sounds. --BOB BOILEN

Anastasio was in town to perform a concert with his big band of brass and brawn, but this selection of Phish and solo tunes felt more personal. ""Summer of '89"" is about his wife, Sue, while ""Backwards Down the Number Line"" reflects on his bandmates and friends. He opened this set with ""Sleep Again,"" a song that looks to a better and brighter future. It's a treat to catch such an intimate glimpse of someone often seen in arenas, steeped in collaboration.

But the opening act kept jumping on the piano and nibbling on the set, literally pulling up the carpet and leaving ""presents"" on the floor. How could we not have them back? Did I mention they're hamsters?

Joni and Nash — first names only, please, like Madonna and Cher — are HMSTR. Certainly not the first band to count rodents among its members, but at least they refuse to release a punk album with no punk to be found. ""Snow Day"" is HMSTR's first single, a twee-as-all-get-out holiday pop-punk song by virtue of having ""snow"" in its title. After what sounds like digital snowflakes, the song unleashes a one-minute snowball fight with the fuzziest Tiny Desk destroyers we've ever seen.

FoPoI1IwcTw,Yusuf/Cat Stevens: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"In the summer of 1971, I was a camp counselor at a sleep-away camp for a bunch of 5- to 7-year-olds. For those eight weeks, I walked home with about $50. I bought a guitar and began to learn the songs I'd come to love from the recently released Tea for the Tillerman by Cat Stevens.

""Father and Son"" touched me most — it's a song about growing old, and about beliefs and conviction. More than 40 years later, that songwriter is performing at my desk with his son standing right behind me. You can never imagine the turns life will take.

Nor could he. In 1976, Cat Stevens almost drowned off the coast of Malibu. In his panic, he says, he shouted, ""Oh, God! If you save me, I will work for you"" — at which point he recalls a wave that came and carried him ashore. He converted to Islam, changed his name and left the pop world after one last album in 1978.

He finally returned in 2006, and now we have a new record, Tell 'Em I'm Gone. From that album of great blues covers and originals, produced with Rick Rubin, Yusuf plays some powerful new music, as well as the 1967 classic ""The First Cut Is the Deepest"" — and then brought me to tears by dedicating a version of ""Father and Son"" to me. As I walked around the office after this Tiny Desk Concert, I heard one story after another of an artist who has touched so many. It's a joy to have him back. --BOB BOILEN

8Lh1IWgUvpU,Dublin Guitar Quartet: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Don't ask the members of the Dublin Guitar Quartet to play the time-honored classics of the Spanish repertoire. They might play traditional Spanish style classical guitars, but they're not your standard guitar ensemble. The Dubliners are strictly devoted to contemporary music. They've been commissioning new pieces and adapting others for both acoustic and electric guitars since 2002, when the group formed at the Dublin Conservatory of Music and Drama.

Dressed more like stylish bankers than hipsters, the musicians filed behind Bob Boilen's desk in matching suits and proceeded to make string quartet music by Philip Glass shine in a completely new way.

Whether you know the Glass quartets or not, it's astonishing how satisfying the music sounds on four guitars. The interlocking parts are transparent and the music seems to breathe fresh air. The group's intonation is impeccable, the rhythms crisp and precise whether they are keeping the propulsive engine chugging or lurching to a sudden new arpeggio. Watch their heads, all bobbing in unison.

In these arrangements by DGQ, the music is far more subtle than simple repetitions. Just a slight vibrato on the high notes in the third movement of the Second Quartet gives them a sweet, pearly sheen. And the slow section of Glass' Third Quartet, tender as a lullaby, is punctuated with carefully selected notes that hang in the air like fragrances. In other spots, brash strumming summons the spirit of flamenco.

Glass' music has been a staple for these musicians, but they also play pieces by Steve Reich, Henryk Górecki and Irish composer Donnacha Dennehy. They've even paired with a couple of rock bands. With eight hands and 24 strings it seems the DGQ can tackle almost anything. - TOM HUIZENGA

Fw2X9dMtDmc,Sam Amidon & Bill Frisell: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Sam Amidon takes traditional music and makes it his own. He might begin with a traditional murder ballad and then morph it into something of his own, fueled by Bill Frisell's languidly atmospheric guitar, Shahzad Ismaily's minimal but essential percussion and Amidon's own yearning voice. At other times, Amidon weaves his own new tunes into worn, weary, seemingly ageless sagas.

Amidon has been doing this for a long time. In 1998, back when he was 16, NPR aired a story about his Vermont contra-dance band Popcorn Behavior, a group he'd assembled with his friend Thomas Bartlett (a.k.a. Doveman). Sixteen years later, Amidon has made a gorgeous new album, Lily-O, and performed a pair of its songs at the Tiny Desk — followed by ""Short Life,"" from his 2013 album Bright Sunny South. -- BOB BOILEN

yxteG1thK5I,Pat Benatar & Neil Giraldo: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"""You know I wrote this for you, baby — you know that."" ""Oh, yeah, sure.”

Pat Benatar and Neil Giraldo do mock-bickering as well as any long-married couple – which, of course, is exactly what they are. More notably, they've formed a commercial and creative juggernaut spanning more than three decades, with the Brooklyn-born Benatar singing and Giraldo working as her guitarist, producer and fellow songwriter.

Benatar's recording career spans a dozen studio albums, seven of which have sold more than a million copies, and has yielded multiple Grammy Awards and some remarkably sturdy staples of the classic-rock canon. Though most widely associated with a string of chart-toppers in the late '70s through the '80s — ""Love Is A Battlefield,"" ""Heartbreaker,"" et al — Benatar and Giraldo still draw huge crowds, for reasons made abundantly clear here. Classically trained as a mezzo-soprano, Benatar still possesses a formidable instrument, and the pair's songs have lost none of their appeal in the intervening decades. And, of course, the duo performs with an agreeable mixture of lighthearted banter, chops and charm.

At the Tiny Desk, Benatar and Giraldo ran through three of their classic songs: 1979's ""We Live For Love,"" 1984's ""We Belong"" and, after a long and satisfying windup, 1981's ""Promises In The Dark.” -- STEPHEN THOMPSON

Being a fan of Garza means accepting the world on his terms — and his world is filled with infinite musical possibilities. He's got a tremendous collection of musical friends who call on him for his work as a backup musician in studio sessions and on stage. For example, he and vocalist Gaby Moreno (already a Tiny Desk veteran) have been touring together lately, and you get a taste of her powerful voice as she joins Garza here.

iKuFujJq6zU,Roomful Of Teeth: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Mix a bit of yodeling with Tuvan throat singing, add in a pinch of Sardinian cantu a tenore, fold in compositions from cutting-edge composers and you have the vocal group Roomful of Teeth. This eight-voice ensemble, which includes the 2013 Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Caroline Shaw, is gleefully dismantling the traditional definition of ensemble singing right before our ears (and teeth!).

Musical descendants of the innovative extended vocal techniques of Meredith Monk, the Teeth tend to make sounds — some sweet, others alarming — that you probably haven't heard from a group of humans.

In Australian composer Wally Gunn's ""The Fence is Gone,"" verses emerge from an infrastructure of ""oh-ha"" syllables and a simple drum pulse, ending with women's voices, tight in harmony, like a chord from a Casio keyboard. In Rinde Eckert's ""Cesca's View,"" imagine a lonely cowgirl on some windswept plain. Estelí Gomez gets her yodel on, beautifully, while the three other women vocalize in close, barbershop-style harmony. It literally ends on a high note.

To finish, Teeth founder and director Brad Wells contributes ""Otherwise."" Warm, rounded tones in male voices contrast with a steely sheen from the women and a high drone like a Tibetan singing bowl. The harmonies take a tangy, almost Bulgarian turn, then we get something truly otherworldly. A pulsing, slightly creepy Sardinian ""bim-bom"" vocalise buzzes like a gigantic cicada. Dashon Burton's operatic baritone soars above it all. The agility of the voices and multicolored blend they achieve are extraordinary.

As the applause faded away, one of the Teeth said, ""Thanks for letting us yell at you."" No, I think it's we who are grateful — and perhaps a little stunned. --TOM HUIZENGA

The band has been making fans across the country one gig at a time, one song at a time — whether singing in English or Spanish, whether playing guitars or stringed instruments that come directly from Making Movies' ancestral Panama, whether playing drums or dancing a Mexican zapateado. 

One of the joys of co-hosting Alt.Latino for the last four and half years has been the way the show has helped me discover new artists who make me feel as if I've been listening to them for years.

On Halloween 2014, the Sun Ra Arkestra — complete with costumes inspired by Egyptian symbolism and science fiction — performed a rousing, out-of-this-world Tiny Desk Concert. The band was led by 91-year-old alto saxophonist Marshall Allen, who's been with the Arkestra since the early 1950s.

AbwPwWqA-QQ,Banks: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Tiny Desk Concerts often require creative and logistical transformations, from electric bands going acoustic to big bands squashing into a tiny space to many players gathering around a single microphone. But the setting is particularly challenging for vocalists, especially those accustomed to heavy production, effects or — in the case of recent guest T-Pain — generous dollops of Auto-Tune.

T-Pain's effects-less set grabbed more attention at the time, given the extent to which digital alterations are expected of him, but this performance by Banks is, in its own way, an even greater high-wire act. Banks' terrific full-length debut, Goddess, is constructed out of layer upon layer of electronics, beats, samples and other means of submerging the singer's voice in swirling accoutrements. With assistance from keyboardist/guitarist John Anderson and percussionist Derek Taylor, she's not all alone behind the Tiny Desk, but her expressive voice is fully exposed here.

Kicking off her three-song set with ""Beggin For Thread,"" Banks sets the scene in vulnerable, breathily seething fashion before opening the throttle in her choruses. On record, she's placed at the center of lavish productions, each suitable for throbbing remixes and banks of swirling lights. At the Tiny Desk, though, she serves notice that she's a powerful singer in her own right — and that heavy production needn't be the product of necessity. --STEPHEN THOMPSON

cfuEIHEZobc,Danish String Quartet: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"An abundance of facial hair is not restricted to the sensitive male indie-rocker set. Three of the four players in the Danish String Quartet could easily pass for hipster Brooklyn beard farmers. ""We are simply your friendly neighborhood string quartet with above average amounts of beard,"" the group's website says.

Yet what's really important about the ensemble is how they play — and judging from this performance behind Bob Boilen's desk, these Nordic lads possess warmth, wit, a beautiful tone and technical prowess second to none.

Like most string quartets, they thrive on classics by Brahms, Beethoven, Haydn and the like. But this group recently took a musical detour that landed them in the foggy inlets of the Faroe Islands (a Danish outpost halfway between Norway and Iceland) and various Nordic hamlets where folk tunes are played and passed on.

""Folk music is the music of small places,"" the quartet notes on its new album Wood Works, which includes the tunes in this concert. ""It is the local music, but as such it is also the music of everyone and everywhere."" You don't own folk music, the band believes, you simply borrow it for a while.

Violinists Rune Tonsgaard Sørensen and Frederik Øland, violist Asbjørn Nørgaard and cellist Fredrik Schøyen Sjölin begin with a set of wedding tunes, some dating back some 400 years and still in use today. Then they pair up an old Danish dance that feels like an Irish jig with a traditional Danish reel from near their home base, Copenhagen. And to close, a slow, evocative wedding dance, in a wistful arrangement by their friend Nikolaj Busk that conjures a lonely fjord shrouded in mist.

The young musicians may only be borrowing this music, but we're awfully pleased they lent a little of it to us. --TOM HUIZENGA

T-Pain's fingerprints are all over pop and R&B and hip-hop. He wasn't the first musician to use Auto-Tune as an instrument — he noticed it on a Jennifer Lopez remix, and remembers ""Deep"" well — but it was, as he says, his style. For a while, in the mid-2000s, he lived at the top of the charts. He dominated that brief moment of our lives when ringtones were a thing. He was celebrated as an innovator, and he happily took his talents where he was invited, which was everywhere.

But somewhere along the way, somebody got it twisted. ""People felt like I was using it to sound good,"" says T-Pain, in an interview that will air on All Things Considered. ""But I was just using it to sound different.”

He just turned 30, but T-Pain has already done enough to drop a greatest hits album next week. We asked him if he'd grace the Tiny Desk without any embellishment or effects to show what's really made his career: his voice, and those songs.--FRANNIE KELLEY

LiGTTICtewQ,Anthony D'Amato: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Anthony D'Amato sings and writes in the tradition of Bruce Springsteen or Josh Ritter: His songs sound friendly musically, but they also tackle the difficult and the twisted. Like those great songwriters, D'Amato's work is universal without devolving into moping. There's also a spirit to these songs, as it's easy to imagine a crowd spontaneously backing these his powerful choruses.

His new album The Shipwreck From The Shore can feel Motown-y, garage-y and Springsteen-y, and all that production serves these gems well. But here at my desk, D'Amato's music is more spare, as the four other musicians simply serve the lyrics and the stories they tell. It's a good entry point if you don't know his music. Then, when you do hear the album, an extra treat awaits.-BOB BOILEN

gxlA6JB3Z6w,Ásgeir: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"When he was 20, Ásgeir Trausti Einarsson released an album in Iceland, sung in Icelandic, with many of the words written by his father. Dýrð í dauðaþögn became the biggest-selling debut in Icelandic music history. A year or so later, he rerecorded that album in English under the name In The Silence, with translation help from John Grant — an American singer-songwriter (and Tiny Desk veteran) now living in Iceland.

Ásgeir's voice is angelic and yearning, his songs simple and universal. At the Tiny Desk, his raw, slowed-down arrangements bring a sense of grace to what were already elegant songs. On piano, with simple guitar accompaniment from his childhood friend Julius Róbertsson, Ásgeir strips these spare tunes down even further, locating their essence in the process. It's been a wonderful year for the singer: His U.S. tour is wrapping up on the West Coast, and many in the U.S. have discovered his music in 2014. If you haven't done so yet, here's your Ásgeir moment.--BOB BOILEN

Singer-guitarist Mikaiah Lei is 21 and drummer Anaiah Lei is 17; they made their first album when they were 15 and 12, respectively. Pink Palms is their newest and best.

I hear Jimi Hendrix in The Bots' bluesy moments, both in the guitar and in Mikaiah Lei's voice, but there's also that great rock-duo punch we've heard in The White Stripes or JEFF The Brotherhood. Still, unexpected sweetness surfaces here, in a way that provides a fine counterpoint to The Bots' frenetic moments.

B6DLS5tahlM,Raquel Sofia: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Singer Raquel Sofia has spent most of her career 20 feet from stardom as a backup singer for Juanes and Shakira. But these days, she's got her own new album and tour, leading a small band of gifted musicians. Sofia's songs are about matters of the heart — and, as you'll hear in her performance here, it's hard to believe that feeling bad can sound this good. Her music doesn't wallow; instead, it makes me want to celebrate and experience the joy and pain along with her.

I hope you find a place in Raquel Sofia's music for yourself. Her voice, her songwriting and her performances more than met the expectations I had after hearing her EPs, so I don't doubt that you'll become a fan, too. --FELIX CONTRERAS",2014-10-14 20:48:27,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6DLS5tahlM,NORMAL,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B6DLS5tahlM/default.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B6DLS5tahlM/mqdefault.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B6DLS5tahlM/hqdefault.jpg,NPR Music,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A
11HHue911Tg,Jackson Browne: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"My admiration for Jackson Browne began with his first album in 1971. I was wowed by the fact that the singer-songwriter had worked with Nico of Velvet Underground fame — his girlfriend at the time — on her first album, Chelsea Girl. He wrote one of my favorite songs on that record, ""These Days.""

More than 40 years on, my appreciation continues to grow. Browne still writes songs with conviction and craftsmanship and careful attention to detail. At the same time, there's a perceptible loosening of attitude: His Tiny Desk Concert performance isn't perfect, his heart showing through every crack in his voice.

Browne can be seen out and about in other informal settings besides this one. At the Newport Folk Festival a few years ago, you could hear him play formally and informally with Tom Morello, Conor Oberst, Dawes and more. Back home on the West Coast, he might just sit in when Sara and Sean Watkins put on theirWatkins Family Hour variety show at Largo.

This week, Jackson Browne turns 66 and releases his 14th album, Standing In The Breach. It's a record that fully captures his rare ability to mix activism with poetry: His stature allows him freedom — he's largely free of obligations — with the ability to play comfortably with musicians of his own choosing. Yet he continues to stretch, working alongside much younger players with different talents and interests, sharing his talents and finding inspiration. It's that passion for playing and exploring that brings Browne to things like the Tiny Desk Concert, an awkwardly intimate setting for such a popular performer. -- BOB BOILEN

cU7ClSwoTp4,Ryan Keberle & Catharsis: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Even if you've never been to a jazz concert in your life, it's likely that you've heard Ryan Keberle play trombone. He's toured with Sufjan Stevens, backed up pop stars like Alicia Keys and Justin Timberlake, recorded for a Woody Allen film, played in Broadway pits and directed music for a church in Manhattan. Left to his own devices, though, Keberle likes to put himself into improvising situations. You'll see him wherever jazz musicians want trombones — read: he's in a lot of big bands — and, increasingly, leading the groups himself.

He's hit upon something with his working band, a quartet called Catharsis consisting of Keberle's trombone, Michael Rodriguez's trumpet, Jorge Roeder's bass and Eric Doob's drums. That lineup indulges the intersecting parts of his tunes, but preserves the melodic through-lines and swinging undertow. Here, as on their new record, Into The Zone, they're joined by Camila Meza, who came from Chile to study guitar and applies that training to her largely wordless vocals. All five drove down from Brooklyn (well, one from Queens) just to showcase that sound for NPR Music.

You get the sense that playing for so many different audiences affects how Keberle thinks about Catharsis. Certainly, his time with Sufjan Stevens rubbed off — he leads off with a lovely arrangement of Stevens' ""Sister."" More generally, Keberle knows he's not going to impress anyone with complexity; he's not after any high-concept framing. He's just targeting the sweet spot where a nifty arrangement meets a solid groove, and after three songs, everyone seemed pretty satisfied at his aim. -- PATRICK JARENWATTANANON

n_4EMO8e-1Y,Bio Ritmo: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Latino migration in the U.S. has placed people of Afro-Caribbean heritage all over the country. Bio Ritmo's heritage leads directly back to that migration — and to the sound of Fania Records, which fueled Latin dance music's transition from the big-band mambos of the 1950s to the cutting-edge sounds of 1970s New York.

Bio Ritmo moves salsa music even further through stellar musicianship: crisp horn charts; a powerful rhythm section of timbales, congas and bongos; and a piano/bass combo that reminds me of the best groove masters in salsa and Latin jazz.

The secret to playing salsa well is a perfect combination of chops and passion that makes listeners move their hips instinctively while looking for enough clear space to break out their favorite salsa moves. This is dance music, and Bio Ritmo has burnished its reputation on dance floors. It's a time-honored tradition: If you can't make the dancers move, then you're in the wrong genre.

So move some furniture around, press play on this video, and enjoy. -- FELIX CONTRERAS

iH7j8ZzW8QY,Tweedy: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"There's something heartwarming about a family making music together. I'm especially sentimental when I see a father with a son, because my son and I made music in contra dance bands and Irish sessions as he grew up.

Years ago, while interviewing Jeff Tweedy before a Wilco concert, I asked him if he'd made music with his kids. He told me about going to his son Spencer's preschool class and writing a tune with all the kids; ""Monkey Mess"" was their final creation. 

Now, all these years later, he and Spencer have put together 20 songs as Tweedy for a new record called Sukierae; the material is strong, personal and bare. Spencer is a great drummer who grew up playing in the basement of a Chicago bar called Lounge Ax (which his mom, Susie Miller, co-owned), and he's got a group of his own called The Blisters. 

The father and son usually perform together with a full-band lineup. But here at the Tiny Desk, we've stripped it down to just the men who bear the Tweedy name — and share the family bond that helps make their music together beautiful.--BOB BOILEN

c8a-7Yv3ktk,Luluc: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"I've spent more time listening to Luluc's second album, Passerby, than any other album this year. It's a calming, seemingly effortless affair: a marriage of graceful singing and storytelling, with guitars and textures that help create an unforgettable aura.The voice and acoustic guitar belong to Zoë Randell, while bandmate Steve Hassett contributes all the remaining sounds. Both are Australian, though these days they split their time between Melbourne and Brooklyn. I might have missed this album — as I did its 2008 predecessor — had it not been for Joe Boyd, a brilliant record producer since the 1960s and the person who brought the world Nick Drake. In 2012, Boyd asked Luluc to perform on a Nick Drake tribute tour, which makes sense: This music is true to the late singer's spirit, and then some. --BOB BOILEN

0kgySblHsVI,Jessica Lea Mayfield: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"These days, Jessica Lea Mayfield is all contrasts, starting with the way she sets her wistful voice against her shimmering guitar. It's got a harder edge to it than the rootsier music of her past. Then there's that cotton-candy hair and all the glitter; her guitar glitters, her eyes glitter, her shoes glitter. It's easier to talk about what isn't glittered — and mostly that'd be her lyrics. In the final song from both her album Make My Head Sing... and this Tiny Desk Concert, ""Seein* Starz,"" she starkly sings:

When it's just us two in the dark
You've got a stranglehold
On my heart

When she speaks of her unicorn-adorned guitar knobs, she sounds about 13. But then there are lines like these, from ""Party Drugs"":

Party drugs just make us argue
Don't know why they didn't used to

In those moments, you're hearing an older, hopefully wiser character. All those schisms in her sound beguile me. On the record, her songs often rock with abandon. Here, they hypnotize. --BOB BOILEN

w5cMqD0WqYE,Sturgill Simpson: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Sturgill Simpson doesn't fit today's common image of a country singer. When he arrived for his Tiny Desk Concert, the 36-year-old Kentucky native sauntered in sleepy-eyed, wearing jeans, a pair of old canvas tennis shoes, no socks and a well-worn button-down blue shirt, one of only two identical shirts he said he had in rotation while on tour. (He appeared a few nights later on Letterman wearing either the same garment or its twin.)

Simpson's songs don't sound like what you'd expect, either: Mostly, it seems, he writes about taking drugs and drinking. Opening his Tiny Desk performance with the seemingly existential meditation ""Turtles All The Way Down,"" Simpson tells the audience it's ""about some other stuff, but mostly drugs."" He follows that song with ""Time After All"" (""I wanna roll off the tempo, lay back and get high"") and ""Life Of Sin"" (""Every day I'm smokin' my brain hazy ... I keep drinking myself silly"") before closing with ""Water In The Well,"" a tamer, comparatively melancholy reflection on loneliness and failed dreams.

Regardless of the themes, Simpson is a force. His acoustic-guitar work in this solo performance is phenomenal, and he possesses a thundering voice that made the NPR offices shudder. ""Turtles All The Way Down"" and ""Life Of Sin"" are from this year's incredible Metamodern Sounds In Country Music, while ""Time After All"" and ""Water In The Well"" both appear on Simpson's 2013 debut, High Top Mountain.

jFycqnOpifQ,Nickel Creek: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Nickel Creek was made to sing and play around a single microphone, so a Tiny Desk Concert seemed inevitable. All it took was a reunion tour — celebrating 25 years of Nickel Creek — to make it happen.

All three of the band's remarkably talented core members have been to the Tiny Desk before. Chris Thile is a veteran, having played the Tiny Desk with friend and guitarist Michael Daves, then later in the same year with Yo-Yo Ma and others in a project known as Goat Rodeo. When The Decemberists performed a Tiny Desk Concert, Sara Watkins was there to play her fiddle and sing. Her brother, Sean Watkins, was also at the NPR offices earlier this year with the marvelous singer Tom Brosseau.

The trio, backed here by bassist Mark Schatz, has no equal. Nickel Creek has been doing this on and off since its members were kids, and what blows me away is the comfort and ease with which they navigate their instruments.

For his Tiny Desk Concert, Amarante brought his small Harmony parlor guitar from the '30s, known lovingly as ""Butter.""

v57WNW-JsgY,Pacifica Quartet: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"With this Tiny Desk Concert by the Grammy-winning Pacifica Quartet, we have the opportunity to explore the world of a single composer. With the arguable exception of Béla Bartók's six string quartets, it's generally accepted that the 15 by Dmitri Shostakovich are the strongest body of quartets since Beethoven.There's no way around it — the Shostakovich quartets are intense, like page-turning thrillers, as they pull you into his world. They are dark and introspective, witty and sarcastic, and stained with the Soviet-era violence and hardship the composer lived through. He died in 1975.Three movements from different Shostakovich quartets display the brilliance of the composer, the sheer power of the string quartet medium and the nuanced playing of this group, which has recorded all of the composer's quartets.Quartet No. 7 in F-sharp minor, Op. 108 (1960)Eerie pizzicato and piercing stabs in the violins help color the twitchy, even sinister, opening movement of the Seventh Quartet. Stalin might have been dead since 1953, but hard-line Soviet politics (including the violent suppression of the 1956 Hungarian uprising) were still in place. The music's lightness and transparency create a crepuscular feel.Quartet No. 3 in F major, Op. 73 (1946)The Third Quartet's first movement looks back to a slightly more pleasant time before World War II. At one point Shostakovich considered a subtitle: ""Calm unawareness of the future cataclysm."" The jaunty opening theme, like Haydn after a few beers, is among the most lighthearted in the 15 quartets. But the mood sobers with an intense double fugue before returning to the opening music and a flashy final page.Quartet No. 8 in C minor, Op. 110 (1960)The Eighth Quartet is Shostakovich's most popular — and one of his most hair-raising. He dedicated it to victims of fascism and war while at the same time creating his own epitaph. The entire quartet is built on a foundation of four notes that spell out his first initial and the first three letters of his last name. The second movement juxtaposes violent energy with a tweaked version of a Jewish folk theme from an earlier work. --TOM HUIZENGA

CsbWsKvyQTU,Ernest Ranglin: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"At 82, legendary guitarist Ernest Ranglin still plays the ska, reggae and jazz that he's championed and helped perfect for more than half a century. Ranglin was a key figure in shaping the sounds of ska — influenced by New Orleans jazz and R&B — in Jamaica in the late 1950s. But most of the world wouldn't hear of ska until producer Chris Blackwell teamed Ranglin up with a Jamaican singer named Millie Small. Together, they recorded ""My Boy Lollipop,"" a song that became a smash at the height of Beatlemania and helped put ska and Jamaican music on the map forever.You've probably also heard Ranglin if you've seen the James Bond film Dr. No — particularly the scenes set in Jamaica. The effects of Ranglin's fluid and rhythmic playing on Jamaican music, from mento to reggae, are deep and long-lasting. But his work as a jazz artist is equally amazing, and here at the Tiny Desk he does a bit of everything, including music from his lyrical and wonderful album Bless Up. So watch as this humble, charming gentleman makes magic on guitar, with his talented young band Avila holding down the beat. --BOB BOILEN

We provided the Epiphone Blues Custom 30 amp, which he promptly cranked. Needless to say, he announced his own Tiny Desk Concert without using the paging system.Mould isn't a shy man — his power chords will tell you that — but he's humble and gentle. Many know Mould from his days with Hüsker Dü, an awesome punkish band from Minnesota that laid the groundwork for the Pixies and more. His subsequent work with Sugar managed to do something none of his other records did so well: Copper Blue sold hundreds of thousands of copies.Beauty and Ruin is solo album No. 11 for Mould, and as you can hear from these songs, he's all amped up and ready to go.

Based in San Francisco and led by Liam McCormick, The Family Crest builds its songs from a combination of infectious enthusiasm and powerful talent. The group owes its huge sound not just to its seven members, but to the community that records and plays with them. Eighty people are credited on The Family Crest's first album, Beneath the Brine.At the Tiny Desk, we heard from seven players with training in classical and jazz, as well as instruments including violin, cello, upright bass, flute, trombone, drums, guitar and McCormick's voice. And what a voice: Trained as an opera singer but with a hunger for jazz, he's one of those fortunate souls with plenty to express and the range to deliver. The three songs performed here give you a sense of what The Family Crest can do, though Beneath the Brine is what you'll want to hear once your jaw has dropped watching this.

uu5laJPLn7g,Quetzal: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"The Southern California band Quetzal recently celebrated its 20th anniversary with a blowout concert that seemed to attract as many musicians as regular people. The band has maintained such a strong presence in the SoCal Chicano music scene that its members could be considered padrinos and padrinas of that free-flowing musical community.Quetzal is respected and admired as much for its commitment to social justice, activism and education — lead singer Martha Gonzalez has a Ph.D — as for its folk-infused music, which gets a marvelous showcase in this Tiny Desk Concert. While the instrumentation is stripped down, the sound is full; the music penetrates the intellect even as it makes your hips sway.The group runs a tight ship musically: Gonzalez's voice could be heard well past the confines of the Tiny Desk, all the way to our web-designing neighbors; guitarist Quetzal Flores unplugged and worked the Mexican jarana for both rhythm and melody, often at the same time; violinist Rocio Marron wove blues licks into Mexican folk runs; bassist Juan Perez provided a nimble and melodic bottom end.Add it all up and you get a glimpse into a musical vision that inspires as much as it entertains. If you didn't know Quetzal before this video, now's the time to catch up. If you're a fan like me, you've already got a head start on looking forward to the next 20 years. --FELIX CONTRERAS

X8hnp9M4JCo,Saintseneca: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"One of the many instruments you may hear Saintseneca play — beyond the banjo, baglama, bulbul, balalaika, bowed banjo, baritone ukulele, bass and bouzouki — is a stomp box. Basically, it's a roughly 2'x2' plywood floorboard meant for pounding the beat. At a show just before this Tiny Desk Concert, craftily bearded singer Zac Little put his boot right through that floorboard.Saintseneca had its beginnings in the heart of a small Appalachian town in Ohio, and the band grew up at college in Columbus. This year's Dark Arc is a pastiche of gentle lyrical moments and punk anthems, often within the same tune and often with that aforementioned stomp, straight from a small wooden porch.After Saintseneca left the Tiny Desk, I pointed the band to a hardware store to replace its broken floorboard — only to get a note a while later telling me that the new board had been destroyed within weeks. Here's a good sampling of what the group does best, though you should be sure to see Saintseneca in concert, where its fierceness is afoot. --BOB BOILEN

taEcgisSiNs,Highasakite: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"My first time seeing this Norwegian band was at a fairly soulless convention center in Austin, Texas. They transformed that big, open room into an intimate affair. So having them perform at the Tiny Desk, an already intimate space, was a thrill. It was also the first appearance of a flugabone here. Kristoffer Lo plays that mournful horn and Ingrid Helene Håvik compliments the yearning with words that are mysterious, somewhat dark and contain surprising twists.The song titles on their 2014 album Silent Treatment seem more like chapter headings in a crime novel. ""Leaving No Traces,"" ""I, The Hand Grenade,"" ""The Man on the Ferry,"" ""Science & Blood Tests"" — you get the picture.

iPJlmxnjnOc,Hamilton Leithauser: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"This is the second time Hamilton Leithauser has graced the Tiny Desk. Two summers ago, he and his band The Walkmen played a powerful set of songs from their final album for now, Heaven. The Walkmen announced an indefinite hiatus toward the end of 2013, and since then we've heard strong solo records from Walter Martin and Peter Matthew Bauer — and, of course, Leithauser himself, which is what prompted us to invite him back.

These songs put Leithauser's voice front and powerfully center, even more than it was in the band. There's a more relaxed feel all over his new solo album, Black Hours, though a few full-throttle tunes get the most out of his huge voice — including the second song from this set, ""Alexandra."" Along with The Walkmen's Paul Maroon on guitar, Leithauser brought along Hugh McIntosh, who played drums in Leithauser's old band The Recoys. All in all, a fine re-introduction to a singer who's lost none of his power, even as he's matured and loosened as a performer. --BOB BOILEN

2JiLsYfbWD8,Marisa Anderson: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Marisa Anderson knows where American guitar music has been and where it is now, and probably possesses an inkling of where it can go. She's studied the history and musical nuance of blues, country and folk music through and through, and ingests it all in a style that's as raw as it true. But mostly, Anderson just wants to kick up some dirt — which isn't easy here, given that the NPR Music offices are relatively clean. (Mind the towering stacks of CDs, though. They could topple over at any time.)

In 2013, Anderson released two albums. December's Traditional and Public Domain Songs contains exactly what its title suggests; as she says, ""I thought of these songs like our national parks — they belong to all of us. If we don't use 'em, we'll lose 'em, I reckon, or someone will buy 'em."" At the Tiny Desk, that includes Stephen Foster's parlor song ""Hard Times Come Again No More,"" in which she slowly builds the melody with a violent shake.

Mercury came out six months prior, and it side-winds through Americana off and on the beaten path. She plays ""Sinks and Rises"" on the lap steel; it's an ode to a Kentucky swimming hole. Quick to defer to the influential musicians before her, she pays tribute to blues guitarist Rev. Gary Davis with a deconstruction of his song ""Hesitation Blues."" Anderson's version has a bit more pick-up — and, since she doesn't sing, finds clever ways to mimic Davis' jokey speak-singing style.

Just when the gospel songs of ""Canaan's Land Medley"" set us in meditative mood, Anderson whips out a baby-blue Stratocaster for ""Galax."" It's got that chicken-pecking-at-corn rhythm, egged on (sorry) by a wild slide. If it sounds like 12 simultaneous hoedowns, that's by design: The song came to Anderson while she stood in the parking lot of a bluegrass festival, overwhelmed by everything hitting at once. --LARS GOTRICH

3h8Y3cZi66Y,Holly Williams: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Truth be told, Holly Williams brought me and many of my hardened colleagues to tears. The singer-songwriter has a magnificent way with words and phrasing, not to mention a country-music lineage that fills her with pride and guides her poignancy and subject matter.

Country is in her blood: As the daughter of Hank Williams Jr. and half-sister of Hank Williams III, she's also the granddaughter of the ultimate country legend, Hank Williams Sr. That said, it was a song about the other side of her family, ""Waiting on June,"" that brought us to tears that day. It's a song about her grandparents on her mom's side, married for 56 years, and it tells a tale of love and unwavering dedication; of two kids meeting in a cotton field and the love that fills their lives through war, birth and death.

We were slower than we used to be

The nursing home told June and me

That we'd have separate rooms side by side

Oh, what I'd give for one more night of sleeping with my wife

Since '45, I've touched her skin in the middle of the night

So I'm lyin' in this single bed until they cut the lights

That's when she'll sneak in and I'll be fine

Holly Williams came to the Tiny Desk still able to hide her pregnancy behind her guitar. She's married to musician Chris Coleman, and it's easy to imagine that some years down the line, their offspring will sing new songs about ageless feelings of love and hurt, happiness and tragedy. Country music doesn't die. --BOB BOILEN

YYdAE6a0ZH0,John Grant: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"John Grant's songs don't mess around: The music isn't complicated, while the lyrics function as darts of retort and thought. His album Pale Green Ghosts is decorated with synthesizers, his voice often drenched in reverb; those tools and textures help make the record strong and everlasting.

So when Grant came to the Tiny Desk with just an acoustic guitarist — and wanted to play piano himself — I feared that the power of the songs I'd come to love wouldn't translate amid such bare sounds. I was wrong, and his music was just right. The lyrics rush forward and hit hard. Try this line from the first song he performs, ""Where Dreams Go to Die"":

Baby, you're where dreams go to die
I regret the day your lovely carcass caught my eye

Grant is known to some as the singer from the Denver band The Czars, but these days he lives in Iceland. He recently helped translate the best-selling Icelandic album from Ásgeir Trausti into English. Pale Green Ghosts is his second album on his own, though he did have help from the band Midlake when he recorded Queen of Denmark in 2010. The two solo records and much of his writings are deeply personal, touching on his sexuality and his battles with drugs and alcohol. Stripped to its core, this material gets even stronger — and here's proof. --BOB BOILEN

Up there with the ear-shaking voice of Adele, the desk dancing of Gogol Bordello, the stripped down version of Phoenix — not to mention magic moments with Alt-J, Angel Olsen and Lucius and more — Moon Hooch blew me away with just two saxes and a drummer. Their music is a mix of the best jazz, EDM and rock have to offer. It's out there, it's danceable and you may find yourself feeling a sense of reckless abandon!

The band is saxophonists Mike Wilbur and Wenzl McGowen, and drummer James Muschler. They all studied in New York at the New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music, and every single moment of every song I've ever seen them perform has been full throttle. They call their music ""cave music,"" taking the best elements of electronica — the brutal stops, starts and shifts — and performing those unnaturally precise hairpin turns organically by blowing on horns and banging on drums. This for the boldness in all of us. Embrace Moon Hooch. --BOB BOILEN

Bnq9rz8SHC0,The Foreign Exchange: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"While on a world tour to support their fourth album, Love in Flying Colors, The Foreign Exchange stopped by the Tiny Desk to rev up a Friday afternoon. I've followed Phonte Coleman and Nicolay in their 10 years as a band — and it's evident their writing and production are honest and downright pungent at times. But when it's time to perform, it's all about fun.

Backed by keyboardist Zo! and percussionist Boogie, Phonte, never short for words, lays down some quick ground rules. He then proceeds to interpret lyrics to meld three stripped-down highlights from their latest LP, including one of our top sleepers from last year.

3XyKhTwk9X8,Lydia Loveless: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"For 23-year-old singer-guitarist Lydia Loveless, gritty, countrified blues-rock is a palette broad enough to include literary drama — complete with fatalistic references to the doomed French poets Paul Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud — and a plainspoken plea for oral sex. In fact, ""Head"" and ""Verlaine Shot Rimbaud"" (both of which appear on this year's terrific Somewhere Else) pop up back-to-back in this subdued but seething three-song Tiny Desk Concert, which Loveless recorded with the help of her full touring band.

Loveless follows ""Head"" and ""Verlaine"" with ""Mile High,"" an even newer single (released with a cover of Kesha's ""Blind"" as a B-side) she'd just put out as a 7"" on Record Store Day.

vDcs3N__VJc,Tracy Silverman: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Tracy Silverman has been called the greatest living exponent of the electric violin. But we're not talking just any electric violin. After he graduated from Juilliard in 1980, Silverman designed his own six-string instrument, creating new musical possibilities and inspiring some of today's greatest composers to write for him — including John Adams (The Dharma at Big Sur) and Terry Riley, who says, ""Tracy's violin is like an orchestra in and of itself.""

Silverman's instrument looks a little like an electric guitar, a mini Stratocaster complete with frets. To achieve his orchestral sound, he works with looping pedals. They record what he plays, then send the music back out so he can add new layers. On the opening piece, ""Matisse: La Danse,"" notice how he starts with a few simple riffs that soon become the setting for a series of improvised countermelodies all flowing at once.

A self-described NPR junkie, Silverman adores the theme music from NPR's various news shows. He couldn't resist cooking up a new piece, a little theme and variations, teasing familiar tunes from All Things Considered and Morning Edition. (He also couldn't resist filming a selfie.)

In Axis and Orbits/Mojo Perpetuo, Silverman's closing number, pizzicato notes set up a foundation for mesmerizing, long-bowed melodies, expanding out into deep space like planets in orbit. With distorted electric guitar sounds and reverb, he finally segues to a more virtuoso section reminiscent of a Paganini Caprice.

Who knew that with a little ingenuity, imagination, six strings and a couple of pedals one could conjure such an enormity of sound from a single instrument? And who knows where Silverman will take his versatile violin next? --TOM HUIZENGA

NIfTCmwgIbY,Conor Oberst: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Conor Oberst's new album has fast become my favorite of the Bright Eyes singer's solo projects, so having him come to NPR and perform a few of these songs at the Tiny Desk was especially exciting. The new music on Upside Down Mountain contains the sort of personal songwriting that got me loving him in the first place. His backing band for this tour is the roots-rock group Dawes, which has a huge following in its own right.

At the Tiny Desk, Dawes brothers Taylor and Griffin Goldsmith joined in on beautiful harmonies, guitar and some light percussion. It was an especially sweet day — a rare weekend Tiny Desk Concert that had friends and families present, including Oberst's wife (Corina Figueroa-Escamilla) and his father Matthew.

Oberst actually began making music on his dad's four-track cassette machine more than 20 years ago. Now 33, Oberst seems much happier, if his songs are any indication. You may even see that on his face as he performs these stripped-down and soulful songs on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. --BOB BOILEN

xm6Bf7dkp6E,Mali Music: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"On a particularly muggy day this past week, Mali Music arrived at NPR's D.C. headquarters armed with only his enthusiasm (and a teensy entourage). Though the humid haze and some midday I-need-a-coffee-stat office funk hung all around him, he soldiered his way through.

Throughout his new album, Mali Is..., the singer-songwriter and musician showcases his unabashed positivity and the sort of uplifting spirit that can faithfully be found ringing through choirs down South; as a boy, Mali Music was raised in the church in Savannah, Ga. But when compared to his previous albums — The Coming and The 2econd Coming — the new record avoids the direct, at times repentant, language of traditional gospel music. He says he's using his new perspective to serve a higher purpose, to make a difference. That message travels a bit further when it aligns with the sounds and words of the mainstream; these tools are necessary for adjusting to the secular world.

In this session, you'll see Mali Music hop from in front of a microphone, backed by booming production streaming from his DJ's laptop, to an intimate cuddle with an acoustic guitar, and finish in a relaxed position behind a keyboard for a touching performance of the album's lead single, ""Beautiful."" With every song — and between the tracks, with motivational messages strung throughout — he demonstrates his readiness and capability to take on the industry, as he charges forward with an electrifying message of hope. --KIANA FITZGERALD

KjqQLTCU5fU,Rodney Crowell: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Rodney Crowell performs with the ease and swagger of a man comfortable in his ways. He carries his songs the way he carries his old guitar: out in the open, no case, almost as an extension of his body.

The man from Crosby, Texas, has been writing country songs for much of his life. At 22, he moved to Nashville and honed his craft with country greats Jerry Reed and Guy Clark. Emmylou Harris would record his song ""Till I Gain Control Again,"" and these days — 40 years later — Crowell is a legend whose songs have been recorded by Waylon Jennings, Johnny Cash, Rosanne Cash and the Oak Ridge Boys, among others.

Crowell's commercial success in the late '80s was huge, and in 2003 he was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. Now, he's just released his 14th solo album, Tarpaper Kid, and it's filled with poignant autobiographical songs, marked by brilliant turns of phrase and thoughtful observations. Here, he performs three of its songs, with the aid of backup singers Shannon McNally and Joanne Gardner. --BOB BOILEN

PDdudDaWdqY,Eliot Fisk & Paco Peña: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Eliot Fisk looks like the happiest man on the planet. Watch that face as he plays guitar. Between performing music by J.S. Bach and partnering with the world's best flamenco guitarist, Paco Peña, Fisk can barely control his joy. I find his exuberance and their performance undeniably brilliant, inspiring and so completely universal.

The repertoire here ranges from Baroque compositions by Bach and Domenico Scarlatti to present-day flamenco. And what happens when these two master players get together is a mix of meticulous and improvised, with Fisk leaning toward the former and Peña toward the latter.

Fisk was a student — in fact, the last student — of the great Spanish guitarist Andrés Segovia. Peña was born in Spain and is a composer in addition to being a gifted performer. On these tunes, and with Fisk, Peña tends to never play the same thing quite the same way. It makes for music that's filled with craft (watch those fingers fly!) and surprise for both the player and the audience. --BOB BOILEN

f3Y55KWAhjs,Marian McLaughlin: NPR Tiny Desk Concert,"Marian McLaughlin is a unique musician based in the Washington/Baltimore area, and because she's lived in D.C., I've had a chance to watch her grow. She's an artist on her own path, making music like few others.

The closest comparisons might be Joanna Newsom or Diane Cluck, both of whom I admire; both are of their own place and time, and the music they make connects on a personal level. Listening feels as if you've entered their meticulously decorated living rooms. And so it is for Marian McLaughlin, with her quirky and wistful style of singing — and her unusual nylon-string guitar playing, which balances staccato and spacious sounds.

When I saw McLaughlin perform with a string quartet, I felt compelled to bring her to the Tiny Desk. Ethan Foote, the fellow on the upright bass, did the arrangements; Geoff Manyin is on cello and Nick Montopoli, on violin, is from the group Invoke. The strings add considerable atmosphere to McLaughlin's music; you can hear it especially in the opening song about Otto Lilienthal, a German mechanical engineer who was a precursor to the Wright Brothers. These three songs are from McLaughlin's self-released record on Bandcamp, titled ""Dérive."" --BOB BOILEN

HbMXaZrdcNY,Simone Dinnerstein: NPR Tiny Desk Concert,"Almost any pianist, from a budding beginner to a pro like Simone Dinnerstein, will tell you that one of the basic techniques of keyboard playing is also the toughest to master: making your hands to do separate things simultaneously.

The great Johann Sebastian Bach knew this to be true. That's the primary reason he composed his Two-Part Inventions. On one hand (pardon the metaphor) they are rigorous exercises he wrote in the 1720s for the musical education of his children and students. On the other hand, as Dinnerstein told the audience at this Tiny Desk Concert, they are ""an endless well of musical knowledge and imagination."" Some of the Inventions zing with the speed of a sewing machine. Others dance and some unfold like a gentle aria.

Dinnerstein learned a number of Bach's Two-Part Inventions as a youngster. Later she used them to teach her own students how to divide their brains. And now, as an adult musician with a major career, she has returned to these deceptively simple pieces, finding their complexity especially satisfying.

She also likes the way the inventions force the player to make the piano sing. That's not easy when you consider the piano is actually a percussion instrument of wires and hammers concealed inside a box. Bach himself noted that they are good not only for playing ""neatly in two parts"" but also ""to achieve a cantabile style of playing."" That's musical jargon for playing the music in a singable style. And oh how poetically Ms. Dinnerstein makes our Tiny Desk piano sing.--TOM HUIZENGA

he-eAyHRfFg,Juana Molina: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"No one else makes music that sounds like this. Juana Molina takes familiar elements — guitars, drums, keyboards, voice — and manipulates them into bewildering, attractive, polished jewels. Her songs don't fall into beat patterns we're used to, but we can dance to them. The guitar doesn't make sounds you'd expect, but we can relate to them. It's as if she'd been raised by wolves and discovered the world of music on her own.

The truth, however, is that Juana Molina is a creative soul. A comedian in her home of Buenos Aires, she found success in that field before giving it all up for music at age 23. Now 51, with six imaginative records in her catalog, Molina brings her small band to share some magic at the Tiny Desk.

Also an actress in Jim Jarmusch's Only Lovers Left Alive, Hamdan possesses an allure unlike any performer I've seen, and it comes through clearly in this Tiny Desk Concert. Her singing is both casual and provocative, framed by provocative and commanding movements.

These three songs are stripped-down versions of pieces from Hamdan's current album, Ya Nass. Amazingly, these hypnotic arrangements came together mere moments before her Tiny Desk Concert. Hamdan had only just met Gabriel Gordon when they traveled down together from New York that morning. They're unrehearsed, and yet locked into a sound that's calm, cool and universal. --BOB BOILEN

PwEFg6xEVR8,Ages And Ages: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Everyone knows there are five immutable truths in life. No. 1 is ""Nothing's ever easy."" No. 2 is ""Nobody does the right thing."" No. 3 is, well, you get the idea.

The Portland, Ore., band Ages and Ages will likely make you rethink these immutable truths — particularly the whole idea about doing the right thing in life. Pay close attention to the second song the group performs in this uplifting Tiny Desk Concert, and you'll see what I mean.

The eight young men and women who make up Ages and Ages shower audiences with pure joy. The songs are unabashedly inspirational, thoughtful and crazy-catchy, in ways that make it hard to listen without feeling better about the state of the world. The recipe: Take a liberal amount of group sing-alongs, stir in some hand-clapping, and add a few ecstatic shouts to the heavens.

Ages and Ages is touring in support of its triumphant second album, Divisionary. The group stopped by the Tiny Desk earlier this spring to perform four songs: ""No Nostalgia,"" the infectious opener to the band's 2011 debut Alright You Restless, as well as ""Divisionary,"" ""Light Goes Out"" and ""Our Demons"" from the new record. --ROBIN HILTON

YuwvUoD3Og8,Iestyn Davies: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"The Bee Gees did it. So do Smokey Robinson, Prince and Justin Vernon of Bon Iver. They all sing in the high register usually associated with female singers.

Men have cultivated their upper range in falsetto for centuries. They're called countertenors — at least in the classical world — and today we find ourselves in a golden age of such singers, thanks in part to continued interest in early music.

One of the best of today's crop of countertenors is Iestyn Davies (pronounced YES-tin DAY-vis). Lately, he's been exploring the meticulously crafted, melancholy songs of Elizabethan composer John Dowland. Joining Davies is lutenist Thomas Dunford, who has been affectionately dubbed ""the Eric Clapton of the lute"" by the BBC.

Dowland was a master of melancholy, a condition viewed differently in Elizabethan England than it is today. You might say that, back then, it was almost hip to have the blues, and Dowland instinctively knew how to tap into feelings of rejection, regret and general malaise in his music. (Dowland himself seemed to nurse a lifelong disappointment in never landing a job with Queen Elizabeth.)

Yet not every Dowland song is a downer. The opening number, ""Come again, sweet love doth now invite,"" finds the protagonist relishing the taste of love he's had, wondering if it will ever return. When he weeps over his bad dreams, Davies, an expressive singer with a sweet timbre and a keen ear for drama in the text, shades the music by lightening his tone to sound more vulnerable.

We can't forget the lute in this partnership; it's crucial and shouldn't be viewed as mere accompaniment. Listen for the delicacy in the colors and lines Dowland builds in the lute's part, as if the instrument itself were singing a duet with the voice. --TOM HUIZENGA

haunJARHPm4,Chvrches: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"For a brief moment, I imagined hearing Chvrches perform ""Recover"" or ""Gun"" with a couple of acoustic guitars and perhaps a shaker or two. And, though these songs would surely stand up well when broken down and bared, I'm thrilled that Chvrches came with a small arsenal of synthesizers to perform a few highlights from last year's album The Bones of What You Believe.

Seeing these now-familiar earworms executed up close was nearly as much a campfire moment as an acoustic set might have been, except the flames burned brighter. Lauren Mayberry's voice felt powerful and vulnerable, while Iain Cook and Martin Doherty kept those memorable synth lines bubbling underneath. The result works as a perfect introduction to the Glasgow trio, but also a reaffirmation of talent and longevity for those already love with the band. --BOB BOILEN

cSl4AZNwI94,Timber Timbre: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"The music of Canada's Timber Timbre is often strange and unsettling. The band, led by Taylor Kirk — a crooner with a deceptively sweet voice — makes spare, evenly paced songs that sound like late-night echoes from a swampy woods. It's the kind of music you'd expect to hear in a David Lynch movie, or in HBO's deeply disturbing series True Detective: dark and unnerving, yet oddly seductive.

It's an eerie, mysterious vibe that's nearly impossible to re-create while playing live in someone's office at 2 o'clock on a Wednesday afternoon. But that's just what Timber Timbre does for a captivated crowd in this Tiny Desk performance.

Taylor Kirk is a man of few words. For this performance, he lets the music do all the talking as the quartet eases its way through three songs from the band's latest album, the smoldering Hot Dreams.

The source material for the music is British public-service films from roughly the 1940s through the 1960s.

The band projects carefully crafted films from those public-service messages that sync to the music, liberally using footage and voices from the past as a way of looking at the present. Public Service Broadcasting puts it all together in a powerful way — it's sometimes melancholy but mostly good fun. It's entertainment as education for the head and feet alike.

YVzjKyzX8kA,Cian Nugent: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Cian Nugent doesn't know what he wants to be, and that's OK. The Dublin-based guitarist cut his teeth as a 19-year-old pickin' on the acoustic worlds that John Fahey, Jack Rose and Bert Jansch built. But that was five years ago, and since then, Nugent has come at his instrument and his songwriting from all sides, hitting up psychedelic folk, garage pop and cosmic guitar improvisation along the way.

On a short U.S. tour supporting Angel Olsen (herself a Tiny Desk alum), Nugent stopped by the NPR Music offices to play what he's called the ""incoherent range of the mess that is my musical career."" There's the acoustic ""Grass Above My Head,"" a slow, somber melody that turns into a ragtime jaunt. The song once shared a 7"" with an inventive Black Flag cover and was re-recorded with his band The Cosmos for last year's excellent Born With the Caul.

Nugent then switches to a cheap, no-name electric guitar — purchased just days before in a pawn shop — that only seems to stay in tune when a pencil's been in the nut. (Oh, yes, there's a story about said pencil.) It gives ""Hire Purchase"" the just-barely-off quality required for the raunchy, basement-bar choogle going down — like maybe J.J. Cale is still drunk from yesterday's gig and the only cure is more pencil!

And, in defiance of all daylight, Nugent closes with ""Nightlife,"" which, at the time of the Tiny Desk filming, was still untitled. True to its title, it's the sad-sack set closer sure to be played at last call — heads on the bar, mops out on a beer-soaked floor, with Nugent singing about regret and ""wasted time."" --LARS GOTRICH

l0f6KGsrt-4,Johnnyswim: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Once you're able to see this three-song set by the band Johnnyswim, NPR Music will have published exactly 350 Tiny Desk Concerts — so we've developed a pretty good sense of when a set will stick in our memories for a while. We intuited, for example, that Adele was about to become a dominant force shortly after she breezed into our offices. (Okay, that didn't exactly require psychic powers, but still.) In the case of Johnnyswim, the prevailing sense boiled down to, ""Boy, we haven't heard the last of them.""

Impossibly telegenic and charming, husband and wife Abner Ramirez and Amanda Sudano — who formed their band in Nashville before relocating to L.A. — have the booming voices of great street buskers, but also the polished sparkle of natural-born stage performers. Sudano is the daughter of the late Donna Summer, with whom she used to sing backup, but Johnnyswim's story isn't one of nepotism or overnight success; the two have been at this together for nearly a decade, and they've got the grandiose impeccability to prove it.

In this set, the lovely ballad ""Falling for Me"" is bookended by songs that could be airdropped onto half the shows on television; if you're hearing them here for the first time, don't be surprised if it's your first exposure of many. Johnnyswim opens this session with ""Home"" — a sweet rouser that could easily follow in the footsteps of other recent hits with that title — and closes it with a full-band reading of what promises to be its signature song, the title track from the new Diamonds. As Sudano notes here, the song has morphed into ""an anthem to ourselves to keep ourselves encouraged."" For Johnnyswim, such pep talks won't likely be necessary for long. --STEPHEN THOMPSON

TQ0qy5isP6A,Quilt: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"It's right there in the band's name, but the music of Quilt is truly a tapestry. Its songs are made of small bits of verses and choruses that, heard individually, may not seem to fit. But in the hands and voices of this band, they stitch together beautifully. Interweaving harmonies and guitar lines from Anna Fox Rochinski and Shane Butler set the tone for these tunes — soft and benevolent, dreamy and quivering, with poetry that's thoughtful and playful. The opening song at this Tiny Desk Concert, ""Arctic Shark,"" questions and enchants.

How can I proceed with thee?

This eastern harbor's full of grief

All my heavy dreams are simply a luxury

Horses in the pepper tree and the lighthouse floating in the sea

Quilt has become a favorite live band of mine, and its album Held in Splendor often finds its way into my late-night listening. Comforting and warm, the Boston band's music always has me feeling right at home. --BOB BOILEN

A voice like Aubele's could be restrictive: His lower register seems to always reflect something dark and lonely. Think of your favorite bottom-scraping vocalist and the lyrics he or she interprets.

But while touches of nostalgia and longing seep into both the words and the way he sings them, Aubele can also wrangle a shy smile and a whimsical raised eyebrow with that deep, emotive voice. It's perfect for his own expressive lyrics, which he sings in both Spanish and English — sometimes in the same song. And don't even get me started on his guitar playing. --FELIX CONTRERAS

Xv-FOSJIwrU,Courtney Barnett: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Courtney Barnett can tell you a story like she's your best friend — provided your best friend is a funny poet with an Australian accent. Listen to ""Avant Gardener,"" an autobiographical account of trying to turn a life around through gardening, only to be foiled by a severe allergic reaction. The tale that follows at this Tiny Desk Concert, ""History Eraser,"" is a ramble in an alcohol-fueled dream state; it features some of the best lyric-writing in music today. Here's a sample from that song:

""I found an Ezra Pound and made a bet that if I found a cigarette I'd drop it all and marry you. Just then a song comes on: ""You can't always get what you want"" — The Rolling Stones, oh, woe is we, the irony! The Stones became the moss and once all inhibitions lost, the hipsters made a mission to the farm. We drove by tractor there, the yellow straw replaced our hair, we laced the dairy river with the cream of sweet vermouth.""

The only downside for a fan like me is that these songs have been kicking around my head for more than a year. As she played them, I found myself hoping for something new, too. And so it was that Barnett graced the Tiny Desk with a brand-new tune, not yet on a record, about a suburb near Melbourne known as Preston; it's a song about house-hunting that she appropriately calls ""Depreston."" The song is thoughtful, acerbic and funny, just like the woman who sings it. --BOB BOILEN

Pd2wNvTlfE0,Tom Brosseau: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Tom Brosseau possesses one of the most arresting voices in folk music today. Many people who hear him sing, without knowing his name or face, assume the voice belongs to a woman, as he hovers somewhere around the countertenor range, with an unusually pure tone.

The beauty of Brosseau's voice is magnified in this Tiny Desk Concert by the spare accompaniment of two acoustic guitars. Brosseau is on rhythm, accompanied by Sean Watkins. Watkins, who also plays and sings with Nickel Creek, produced and plays on Brosseau's new album, Grass Punks.

Brosseau is unabashedly sentimental and earnest. It informs his plainspoken story-songs, which find beauty and light in heartfelt themes of love and yearning. But Brosseau also possesses a wry sense of humor; you can hear as much in ""Cradle Your Device,"" a playful take-down of modern technology. The next song he performs, ""Stuck on the Roof Again,"" tells a true story about the octogenarian newspaper columnist Marilyn Hagerty, who got stuck on the roof of her home in Grand Forks, N.D., after a heavy snowstorm.

Brosseau closes his set with ""Today Is a Bright New Day,"" a wistful reflection on lost love and the belief that no matter our past disappointments or missteps, the future is full of hope and opportunity. --ROBIN HILTON

nivz7x_TMK4,The Both: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Singer-songwriters Aimee Mann and Ted Leo are often at opposite ends of the volume knob. But what started as separate sets during a mutual tour, then a few walk-ons during Leo's solo set, is now an adventure in collaboration and mutual songwriting — and the birth of The Both. Months after this Tiny Desk Concert, which we recorded in February, there's an album. For the announcement of that record, Leo said, ""The writing process has largely been long-distance, but it's been line by line, verse by verse, part by part; we'll send each other something and go back and forth until it's finished.""

When they showed up to play together at the Tiny Desk, there was a lot of uncertainty and a sense of adventure. The performances weren't about perfection so much as inspiration, with Mann rocking a bit more and Leo hunting for subtlety in his guitar playing. It wasn't compromise, though, so much as a creative challenge that's unfolding during this set — one of their earliest public performances of these songs. It's fascinating to watch them sing in uncharted territory. --BOB BOILEN

7NBTwmjqUrY,The Haden Triplets: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Petra, Rachel and Tanya Haden are three sisters in love with the art of singing. Born in 1971 to a famous musical father (Charlie Haden is a world-class upright jazz bassist), they've separately taken on vastly different music projects. You may have heard Petra with The Decemberists or tackling the music of The Who a cappella. Tanya plays in Let's Go Sailing, while Rachel sometimes turns up with The Rentals and other projects.

Together, they have a common love for American country and traditional songs, and that's what brought me to them and them to the Tiny Desk. Their new self-titled record is filled with what first made country music grand: songs by The Carter Family, Kitty Wells, Bill Monroe and many others. It's produced by Ry Cooder, an American legend, terrific slide guitarist and lover of all types of traditional music.

At the Tiny Desk, you'll hear the traditional tone and effortless voices that only siblings can produce. It's a treat and a trip in time. --BOB BOILEN

b9sBFoufLd8,Joseph Calleja: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Malta, the island nation 50 miles south of Sicily, may be small, but it's home to one of the biggest stars in opera, tenor Joseph Calleja. And like his country's name, which may originate in the Greek word for honey, Calleja's voice is a potent mix of Italianate passion and sweetness. Just listen to how he pulls the volume back to a slender golden ray of tone several times in Tosti's gorgeous ""Ideale,"" and especially the word ""disciogliea"" in the Puccini aria that closes this performance. His singing requires the breath support of a true athlete, which is key to launching soft sounds — even more than his roaring top notes — all the way up to the cheap seats.

The ability to control dynamic levels and expressively shade notes and phrases were once techniques in nearly every singer's toolbox. But we don't hear as much subtlety these days, and that makes Calleja an especially refreshing throwback to pre-World War II singers such as the suave Tito Schipa and the magical Alessandro Bonci. It's a reason Calleja is in such demand from all of the world's top opera houses.

Along with his voice, the tenor's burly good looks and acting skill have helped land him on the silver screen as well. He plays opera legend Enrico Caruso opposite Joaquin Phoenix and Marion Cotillard in The Immigrant, a story set on the gritty streets of 1920s New York. The film is expected to be in limited release in the U.S. beginning May 2.

The best news of all is that Calleja is just 36. His voice is already changing, growing richer, bigger and a little darker than what you hear on his earliest recordings. With any luck, we'll have a few more decades to enjoy what is already one of the most impressive tenor voices of the past half century. --TOM HUIZENGA

SyETsd-rKP8,Diane Cluck: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"When a performer has an exceptional night, we sometimes say he or she ""left it all on stage"" — the ""it"" being effort, energy, passion, sweat. To close a concert with a raw throat and a rumpled appearance signifies full disclosure, proof that the person on stage has held absolutely nothing back. Diane Cluck's performances, at their best, take a near-opposite approach: unfolding melodies of winding complexity without the barest hint of strain or struggle.

A rich 15-year recording career precedes this year's Boneset, as thrilling a showcase of Cluck's clawed, counterintuitive fingerpicking and elastic voice as anything she's ever released. Witnessing the same process live, however, jams the senses — it's almost easier to imagine some tiny spirit in her chest is controlling the action, turning a pitch wheel with one hand and a tone knob with the other. In three songs at the Tiny Desk (two from Boneset and a sparkling new piano number, ""Grandma Say"") she broke focus only once, to answer a question as she strapped on a set of ankle bells for the set closer, ""Sara."" The bashful smile that attends her whispered reply — ""I got them on eBay"" — is a privilege to witness. --DAOUD TYLER-AMEEN

l9coJQW9f4E,Lowland Hum: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"It's hard to convey the sound of two people in love, but Lowland Hum does that effortlessly. Daniel Levi Goans and Lauren Plank are now Daniel and Lauren Goans; they met a few years ago and spent much of their first married year on the road, singing together on small stages and at house concerts across the country. Daniel was a folksinger in North Carolina, while Lauren had aspirations to sing but mostly did it privately. She has a passion for making things with paper, and you'll see that in the little black book of lyrics she hands out at shows.

This music is mostly unadorned and pure, with considerable attention to detail. Lauren's voice sounds refreshing and simple, and Daniel's passion shakes from his head and literally to his feet. They tour with a few homemade wooden platforms inlaid with small metal jingles — the kind you'd find on a tambourine — and that enhances Daniel's stomp.

JRVDNBCdMFM,Asaf Avidan: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"So I'm driving down the road when I hear this incredible voice coming out of my car speakers — part Janis Joplin, part Nina Simone — and I wonder, ""Who is she?""

That day, I'd ripped a number of CDs onto my phone and didn't remember which record this was. Upon a quick glance at my phone during a traffic light, I discover the name Asaf Avidan. Next traffic light, I look it up and I see a picture of a skinny, handsome white male. I figure that's a mistake — that I must have typed the wrong name — so I wait to get home.

What I discovered floored me. Asaf Avidan is a 33-year-old, very well-known Israeli singer, formerly with a folkish rock band with gold records called Asaf Avidan & The Mojos. He's now on his own with a solo record and no U.S. record label to put it out, but he's on a solo tour that's stunning. He stopped us all cold when he began to sing at the Tiny Desk. There's a disconnect, when you watch this, between what you see and what you hear. And those songs that he writes?

e8IyZHwtsc0,Brass Bed: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"It wasn't an easy road to the Tiny Desk for the four guys from Louisiana who make up Brass Bed. Their tour, for the band's debut album The Secret Will Keep You, was plagued from the start: Singer Christiaan Mader had the flu, there was a death in the family and multiple dates had to be canceled. Their van was broken into and their instruments stolen. So when they heard that a big snowstorm was headed for D.C. at the same time they were to play the Tiny Desk, it felt like yet another bad omen.

Fortunately, they got in just ahead of the first snowflakes and performed a memorable set, as they re-created some of the stellar studio effects on The Secret Will Keep You with a simple but potent pedal steel and bow. For the ethereal closing track from the album, ""Have to Be Fine,"" the guys produced reverb effects by singing a cappella into plastic novelty microphones they'd picked up at a store just outside of D.C.

As soon as Brass Bed's members finished their set, the lifelong Southerners graciously accepted a complimentary ice scraper in case they got into more trouble on the road. But it wasn't enough to get them out of the District; the storm they were trying to avoid snowed them in for an extra night. We wish they could have stayed, and played, even longer. --ROBIN HILTON

Rei carries the accent and spirit of her native Argentina in her jazz-infused vocals.

PFEhLCP6jzs,Cate Le Bon: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"The Beatles may be an odd place to begin a Cate Le Bon conversation, but I remember being struck by the way four guys from Liverpool could sing without their English accents. That's true of most pop singers, whose words often come out sounding more American than anything else. But that's not true with Cate Le Bon. Her phrasing is completely tied to her Welsh dialect — in fact, her first record was in Welsh. I find that that draws me into her songs: The enunciation is completely tied to the loneliness and the questioning. One song she sings at the Tiny Desk, from her brilliant album Mug Museum, is called ""Are You With Me Now?""

There is a feeling I love

Buried in my brow

I have no reason to run

I see no reason

Are you with me now?

Listen to the inflection in the line 'Buried in my brow,' and then when she poses the question; it's so intimate, such a whisper, so inviting. I'm also a fan of her clean, sharp guitar playing and the way she weaves it together with her partner H. Hawkline. If you're a fan of Tom Verlaine and Television, you'll find yourself loving this lyrical guitar duo. It works so well stripped-down, though there wasn't much excess in the original versions to begin with. These are songs of essence, clarity and drive, executed so simply here. --BOB BOILEN

AndEMO__p2U,Suzanne Vega: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"In pop-music circles, Suzanne Vega is known almost entirely for two songs from the late 1980s: the child-abuse ballad ""Luka"" and a song that launched literally dozens of dance remixes, ""Tom's Diner."" But Vega has been making vital, inventive music the entire time — much of it folk-based, though her sound has taken many smart detours along the way — and is about to put out her first album of original material in seven years, Tales From the Realm of the Queen of Pentacles. The challenge, then, lies in capturing a snapshot of her career in only four songs.

For this Tiny Desk Concert — performed with her brilliant guitarist and producer, Gerry Leonard — Vega splits the difference evenly between old and new, bookending her set with the aforementioned classics and tucking two about-to-be-released songs in the middle. Game and good-spirited throughout, Vega performed ""Luka"" and ""Tom's Diner"" as if she hadn't played them thousands of times before — aided greatly by Leonard, who's worked extensively with David Bowie and lends these songs an extraordinary amount of color and texture. (Check out the ""bells"" he adds near the end of ""Tom's Diner."")

Vega's songwriting gifts haven't waned at any point in her long career, and the new songs here — taken from a concept album about the way our world and the spiritual realm intersect — sound as sharp as anything she's done. It only makes sense that, nearly 30 years after her debut, she still examines new realms with grace, empathy and an explorer's spirit. --STEPHEN THOMPSON

2mHFjJszcpU,Fanfare Ciocarlia: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Truth be told, I was scared. We've stuffed a lot of musicians behind the Tiny Desk, but when I saw Fanfare Ciocarlia (pronounced ""fan-FAR-eh cho-car-LEE-ah"") at Globalfest the week before the band arrived at NPR, I couldn't fathom how we'd corral these 12 musicians and their various assorted horns and drums into that truly tiny space.

But the day this joyous Balkan brass band from the Romanian village of Zece Prăjini came to play, it was one of the happiest days I've experienced at our new building. From wedding songs to American rock 'n' roll to the occasional James Bond theme, the group plays at a pace that would make the Ramones burst into a sweat. When you get hooked and want more, find Fanfare Ciocarlia's new record, Devil's Tale. It will help make your parties the stuff of blissful memories. --BOB BOILEN

OcFHOGZ-6aM,Pixies: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"The windowsills were lined with people standing, as every nook between every office desk filled to capacity with NPR employees and their assorted guests. Pixies, after getting misplaced for a time in our parking garage during a moment worthy of This Is Spinal Tap, showed up in time to encounter the largest crowd we've ever assembled for a Tiny Desk Concert. (Our new office space allows for more guests than the old one did, but it's still a mark of this band's significance for so many youthful grownups.)

Black Francis played an acoustic guitar for this set, while drummer David Lovering set up a simple snare and a cymbal, tapping a tambourine with his foot where a bass drum might be. With his electric guitar, Joey Santiago was the only plugged-in member of the group. The newest member of the Pixies is Paz Lenchantin, a musician of many talents who played violin at the Tiny Desk, though she handles bass duties at larger concerts. You may miss Kim Deal on bass for all the good reasons one might miss Kim Deal, but Lenchantin rhythmically fits in well, and was a treat to hear (albeit quietly) on violin.

Prior to the rolling of cameras, the band warmed up the crowd with ""Where Is My Mind,"" but this three-song set features a 2014 tune called ""Greens and Blues,"" a song yet to make it onto a Pixies release called ""Silver Snail,"" and 1989's ""Monkey Gone to Heaven,"" which melted hearts and seared minds with a new memory from a time long past. --BOB BOILEN

G7NapIZ1xGE,Angel Olsen: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Angel Olsen came to the Tiny Desk on an odd autumn day, as an impending storm loomed outside our office windows. It all seemed just right for occasion: Watch her and you'll see calm in her eyes; listen to her and you'll sense torment in her heart. Olsen gave us a preview of her third record on that October day; she wouldn't tell us the title, but she did say the word ""Burn"" with a hint of the title in the words to a song she'd sing. Now, months later and just a few weeks before the release of Burn Your Fire for No Witness, we can share this exclusive preview.

Olsen is a Missouri-born — and now Asheville, N.C.-based — musician via Chicago. The new record was produced by John Congleton with a new band featuring Josh Jaeger on drums and bassist Stewart Bronaugh. The trio began rehearsing these songs in a church turned recording studio in Asheville over the summer. The songs are at times explosive and at times lulling. At the Tiny Desk, the expressive and powerful singer stood alone, and in the process gave us the perfect way to first hear these songs. --BOB BOILEN

oGTVoX7AaRc,Robert Glasper Experiment: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"The third song in this Tiny Desk Concert, explains the jocose pianist Robert Glasper, first appeared on one of his trio's albums of acoustic, instrumental jazz. It was called ""F.T.B."" then, though it later acquired words and a singer and was retitled ""Gonna Be Alright"" on the record which won the 2013 Grammy for Best R&B Album. That in itself provides a sense of the worlds to which Glasper has access; depending on your point of view, he either freely traverses or explodes those boundaries.

Glasper has released two albums of what you might call neo-soul, or maybe organic R&B, featuring a core band (The Robert Glasper Experiment) and guest stars like Erykah Badu, Lupe Fiasco and Norah Jones. Black Radio and last year's sequel, Black Radio 2, aren't heard much on ""urban"" radio, but the point is that they ought to be. Glasper builds his songs with old-school values: singers and MCs who don't need software to carry a melody, improvising within a band, hand-building beats and vamps with live instruments.

That's what you see at the Tiny Desk. ""Trust"" features Marsha Ambrosius, formerly of the duo Floetry, and it's a good example of the Black Radio concept in raw, unpasteurized form. The middle tune is an ad hoc improvisation, and a good example of how Glasper and his Experiment have so dialed in their communication that they can plant seeds of noise and harvest blooms of music. By the time ""F.T.B"" (a.k.a. ""Gonna Be Alright"") rolls around, the mood is familiar and at ease. It's the sound of a band whose members speak many musical languages, but decide to converse in one that feels like its native tongue.

PF0yNKroigk,Afro Blue: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"""Afro Blue"" is a jazz standard written by Mongo Santamaria in 1959, with a lyric added later by Oscar Brown Jr. It's been performed countless times, by everyone from John Coltrane to Robert Glasper and Erykah Badu. The beautifully understated words include the phrases ""undulating grace,"" ""elegant boy,"" ""beautiful girl,"" ""shades of delight"" and ""cocoa hue.""

Afro Blue, a nine-member a cappella troupe from Howard University in Washington, D.C., is all that and more. Its members sing as one with nuance, ease and experience, as if they've been singing together for years. But they haven't: The ensemble is ever-changing, as students graduate and new members audition for a coveted spot in the lineup.

Professor Connaitre Miller formed the vocal jazz ensemble in 2002. Afro Blue recently reached the final four on NBC's The Sing-Off, and it routinely performs at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. It played at the Apollo Theatre in Harlem with Dianne Reeves, and just recently was invited to the White House to perform for the president.

The list of awards and accolades continues to grow, as does the list of invitations to sing. But Miller often turns them down so that the students have enough time to study and don't miss class.

While it usually performs standard ""vocal big band"" songs and jazz blended with contemporary pop music, Afro Blue recently stopped by Bob Boilen's Tiny Desk to sing African-American spirituals — songs that can never grow old so long as talented young groups like Afro Blue sing them this well. --SURAYA MOHAMED

8XxFbJcswQk,Lily & Madeleine: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Sisters Lily and Madeleine Jurkiewicz aren't the youngest musicians ever to play the Tiny Desk, but they come pretty close. Their music — a restrained, homespun mix of folk and pop with undeniably sweet harmonies — certainly ranks among the loveliest we've heard.

Lily is just 16. Her sister Madeleine is 18. And while the older of the two Indiana natives recently headed off to college, leaving her sister behind to finish high school, they still write and record together. They released a stellar EP, The Weight of the Globe, last June, and a self-titled full-length debut followed in October.

Lily & Madeleine's openhearted ballads first found an audience in the fall of 2012, after the pair posted a video for ""In the Middle"" on YouTube. It quickly received more than a quarter of a million views — enough to draw the attention of the Sufjan Stevens-led Asthmatic Kitty label, which signed the sisters and released both their EP and their full-length album.

For the duo's Tiny Desk set, Lily & Madeleine chose not to perform that breakthrough song, opting instead to focus on newer material from the album: the wistful ""Devil We Know,"" ""Paradise"" and ""You Got Out."" --ROBIN HILTON

8y02Rv8sQzw,Van-Anh Vanessa Vo: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Van-Anh Vanessa Vo is a veteran when it comes to taking risks, and it pays off in her compelling music. As a young girl in Vietnam, she knew she wanted to be a traditional musician, even though it was a world dominated by men. It was risky, then, when she pestered a master teacher for three years to give her lessons. He finally gave in, taking her on as an apprentice.

Vo also takes risks in blending East with West in her music. She lends a trippy sound to Frenchman Erik Satie's Gnossienne No. 3, performed on the dan Bau, the traditional Vietnamese monocord. The instrument (""invented by bad girls on the street"") has a single string, but by bending it with a kind of whammy bar made from buffalo horn, Vo creates a haunting landscape of growls, hushed vibrato and graceful slides, all with the exquisite phrasing of an opera singer.

Vo's infectious enthusiasm erupts in her own compositions. ""Three-Mountain Pass"" (also the title of her recent album), for voice and Hang drum, is based on the sensuously evocative texts of Ho Xuan Huong, a groundbreaking female poet (and concubine) from the 18th century. And with ""Go Hunting,"" Vo introduces another traditional instrument, the dan T'rung, a bamboo xylophone from Vietnam's south highlands. This instrument, which looks a bit like a skeleton, is struck with double-headed mallets. The theme starts peacefully at a relaxed pace, but heats up to a dizzying frenzy as Vo's mallets become indistinguishable blurs of speed.

Her adventurous spirit moved her from Vietnam to the U.S. — another risk, but one that paid off with more opportunities for composing; she even won an Emmy Award for her work on a documentary film. Vo is also fond of collaborating with new-music ensembles like the Kronos Quartet, and of playing in prestigious venues such as Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, the Kennedy Center and, of course, Bob Boilen's Tiny Desk. --TOM HUIZENGA

In fact, Christine Salem sings songs that are old: They're work songs and chants from the maloya tradition on Réunion Island in the Indian Ocean. I first heard her in New York City as she shook a flat board called a kayamb, made of cane reeds, with two percussionists flanking her to provide rhythm.

Salem makes powerful, strongly focused music in which all the elements are essential, with nothing superfluous.

GwN-WixHkAw,Dessa: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Part of the Twin Cities hip-hop collective Doomtree, rapper, singer, poet and songwriter Dessa divides her time between singing and rapping, often landing on a spoken-word splitting of the difference. The week she performed this Tiny Desk Concert, she appeared at an All Songs Considered live listening party, during which she opined articulately before closing the night by singing Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"" in the style popularized by Jeff Buckley. This year, the former philosophy major released both a new album (Parts of Speech) and a chapbook of poetry called A Pound of Steam.

As versatile as she is, Dessa faced down a string of challenges in getting to the Tiny Desk. Near the tail-end of a tour — during which thousands of dollars' worth of her band's gear was stolen — her voice started to give out as she battled a bad cold. (Keep an eye out for her expression of relief at the completion of ""The Man I Knew"" in this set.) And, of course, Dessa and her band had to come up with ways to perform three songs from Parts of Speech in such a way that the drums and guitars wouldn't drown out the unamplified voices of herself and singer Aby Wolf.

Once we started recording, though, the seams never showed, let alone split: If it weren't for a bit of between-song tea-sipping, we'd have never known she was under the weather. Instead, what we got was as forceful and whip-smart as everything else Dessa sings, speaks, raps and writes. --STEPHEN THOMPSON

VxpuB10FaSE,Sarah Jarosz: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Bluegrass' most beloved pros often play well into their 80s and 90s, so it would surprise no one if our children's children's children turn up at a Sarah Jarosz concert 70 years from now. The singer and multi-instrumentalist first surfaced as an 18-year-old wunderkind with the release of 2009's Song Up In Her Head, which generated the first of what will likely be many Grammy nominations; now a grizzled 22, she's out performing songs from her fine new third album, Build Me Up From Bones.

That record forms the basis of Jarosz's recent concert at the NPR Music offices, performed with the aid of fiddler Alex Hargreaves and cellist Nathaniel Smith. All polished young pros, the three breezed in happily and knocked us out with a careful mix of technical proficiency and poppy warmth.

HnffuUtUkAA,The Dismemberment Plan: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"When NPR Music started inviting musicians to perform at Bob Boilen's desk back in 2008, we never could have expected that we'd one day host The Dismemberment Plan. For one, the D.C.-area group had long since disbanded; for another, its fleshed-out and periodically funky sound wouldn't seem to lend itself to vastly stripped-down arrangements. When the newly re-formed band finally did make its way to our offices — on the heels of Uncanney Valley, its first album in 12 years — it unsurprisingly made for an odd fit.

According to the group, these particular arrangements of songs from Uncanney Valley were sorted out just a day before this Tiny Desk Concert; after singer Travis Morrison flubbed the call-and-response portion of ""Let's Just Go to the Dogs Tonight,"" he professed nervousness at making the NPR staff holler F-bombs. (No one seemed to mind.) As always, though, The Dismemberment Plan wears its ramshackle qualities well, exuding playfulness and wry charm throughout this set. --STEPHEN THOMPSON

7PQYF4-BbrE,Kronos Quartet: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Sunny Yang joined Kronos Quartet in June 2013. Now, just five months later, the cellist she says she's learned quite a few new works — not just a handful, but about 70 pieces.

That degree of dedication to contemporary composers, coupled with an insane concert schedule, has propelled Kronos Quartet forward over the past four decades. If they wanted, the musicians — who also include founder David Harrington and longtime members John Sherba and Hank Dutt — could reminisce over more than 800 new works and arrangements they've commissioned in 40 years. But instead, the new-music train pushes ever onward to new territories. They remain a living, breathing world-heritage site for music.

Now in the midst of its 40th-anniversary tour, Kronos brings to this Tiny Desk Concert a new arrangement, a work from a new album and, for Kronos, something of a chestnut, a piece the group recorded a whopping five years ago.

Aheym (Yiddish for ""homeward"") was written for Kronos by Bryce Dessner; a member of the Brooklyn rock band The National, he studied composition at Yale. The music thrives on nervous energy, pulsating with strumming and spiccato (bouncing the bow on strings) while building to a tremendous fever. It also opens Kronos' new album of Dessner works.

""Lullaby,"" a traditional song with Afro-Persian roots (from the group's Eastern-flavored 2009 album Floodplain), is woven from different cloth altogether. Colorful tones that lay between our Western pitches are threaded through the music, anchored by a gorgeous solo from violist Dutt; his contribution takes on the warm and weathered sound of a grandmother singing to a child.

Kronos caps off the concert with another hairpin turn, this time to a fresh arrangement of ""Last Kind Words,"" a little-known blues song from around 1930, recorded by singer and guitarist Geeshie Wiley. In Jacob Garchik's exuberant arrangement (which Kronos premiered this fall), interlocking strums and plucks provide a kind of rhythm section, while Harrington's violin stands in for the now-forgotten blues singer. --TOM HUIZENGA

Sometimes there's a drummer (her sister's boyfriend Kyle Gilbride) and at other times another guitarist, her boyfriend Keith Spencer (both play in Swearin'), but even on Waxahatchee's second album, Cerulean Salt, there are plenty of bare-boned songs. This is intimate music for an intimate setting, as we got to stand in careful silence, listening intently and capturing this frail and powerful performance. --BOB BOILEN

onQLAEEeta8,John Legend: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"At 34, John Legend has sold millions of records, won nine Grammys, collaborated with many of the biggest stars in music (Jay-Z, Kanye West, Alicia Keys, The Roots, et al), and achieved the kind of statesmanlike musical-ambassador status usually afforded to artists twice his age. He is, in short, the sort of star who doesn't usually perform behind desks in offices.

But once we'd wedged a piano back there, Legend sounded perfectly at home. His rich, soulful voice never suffered for a lack of processing and production as he performed three songs for NPR Music and a few hundred of our rapt coworkers, loved ones and hangers-on.

Though he recently released a fine new album titled Love in the Future, from which ""Made to Love"" and ""All of Me"" were drawn for this set, Legend took special care to provide the backstory for ""Move,"" which he'd recorded for the soundtrack to 12 Years a Slave. Legend executive-produced that soundtrack himself — don't be surprised if you wind up hearing him perform ""Move"" again on Oscar night — and recorded the album version with U.K. musician Fink. Here, though, it's stripped down considerably, with just Legend's piano and the acoustic guitar of guest Bobby Anderson providing accompaniment.

Legend doesn't play settings this intimate very often, and it's not as if he has anything to prove at this point in his career. But, just in case he did, he retains a busker's lung capacity, the charisma of a born star and the easygoing grace of a performer fit for any stage — even a tiny one. --STEPHEN THOMPSON

q8WWNKhdy-w,Debashish Bhattacharya: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"You've probably never seen or heard an instrument like this. The Hindustani slide guitar is the creation of Debashish Bhattacharya, whose creation pairs his first love — a Hawaiian lap steel guitar, a gift from his father when he was only 3 — and the sounds of India. You can see the similarities to a lap steel guitar, as Bhattacharya lays the guitar across his legs, sliding a metal bar to create the fluid, almost vocal melodies. The additional strings (and lack of frets) allow him to slide easily between notes, in the process creating a sound that resonates and drones while remaining attuned to his Calcutta home.

His music incorporates a good deal of North Indian (Hindustani) classical music, but you can also hear the blues pouring out from this stunning creation. I first met Bhattacharya 17 years ago when he was touring with other great slide guitarists, Bob Brozman and Martin Simpson. In those 17 years, his music has become even more astonishing, and his instrument refined even further. This trio includes his daughter (Anandi Bhattacharya) on vocals and his brother (Subhasis Bhattacharjee) on tabla.

The current album and some of what's played here today can be found on two different records, the first with guitarist John McLaughlin and Dobro master Jerry Douglas (titled Beyond the Ragasphere) and the second with his brother and daughter (titled Madeira: If Music Could Intoxicate). These are brilliant recordings — and a good place to start exploring more from this unique artist after his intoxicating Tiny Desk Concert is done causing your jaw to drop. --BOB BOILEN

fXjfvEcAV6w,Gary Burton: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"In 1963, the jazz pianist George Shearing, an enormously popular act in his day, made an album that was unusual for him. He asked his new, 20-year-old vibraphone player to write an album of contrapuntal, classical-music-inspired compositions, and recorded them with a woodwind quintet atop a jazz rhythm section. It's out of print now, but Out of the Woods received good reviews, and it remains an early career highlight for its young architect, Gary Burton.

Gary Burton is 70 now, and that's just two pages' worth of his new autobiography Learning to Listen. Here's a guy who played with Stan Getz and Chick Corea, was an early adopter of jazz fusion, and became the Dean of Berklee College of Music. But when he stopped by the Tiny Desk, he saluted that moment by calling an unrelated tune called ""Out of the Woods."" For his next number, Burton called ""Remembering Tano,"" a piece he wrote for another man with whom he's worked briefly but meaningfully: new-tango pioneer Astor Piazzolla.

Burton has a long history of hiring great guitarists, and his current band is no exception. Julian Lage is just 25, but his own band already played the Tiny Desk once; his jabs and lean threading brighten this session. Their dialogue accentuates another thing about Burton: He may be past retirement age, but he can still dazzle. He concocted an impromptu blues for his final number, and sent his signature four-mallet grip slaloming up and down the instrument. --PATRICK JARENWATTANANON

xoMzPhYYIsM,Ashley Monroe: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"In the last few years, Ashley Monroe has cobbled together an impressive country-music pedigree by working alongside both upstarts (Pistol Annies with Miranda Lambert and Angaleena Presley) and longtime Nashville veterans (Vince Gill produced Monroe's solo album Like a Rose), and even collaborating with Jack White every now and then. Monroe belongs to a remarkable wave of gifted young country-singing women who've surfaced with great records in 2013 — a list that also includes Kacey Musgraves, Holly Williams, Brandy Clark and others — while tapping into the relatable searches and struggles of everyday people.

This three-song set at the Tiny Desk, performed with the aid of guitarist John Shaw, captures a nice cross-section of Monroe's appeal: The title track from Like a Rose tells an optimistic story of survival, the ambivalent ballad ""You Got Me"" chronicles ill-advised romantic obsession, and, of course, the Top 40 country hit ""Weed Instead of Roses"" functions as a playful, fun-loving mission statement. Speaking of ""Weed Instead of Roses,"" which closes this charming performance, Monroe says the straitlaced Gill insisted upon the song's inclusion on Like a Rose — even going so far as to declare it a condition of his producing the album. The guy knew what he was talking about, both in his support of the song and of Monroe herself. --STEPHEN THOMPSON

nDdO60XcqPQ,Typhoon: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"The appropriately named Typhoon is a sprawling band with an epic sound. The group from Portland, Ore. crafts rock anthems like emotional tidal waves, propelled by the stories of frontman Kyle Morton. His deeply personal tales are often full of grief and loss. But just as often they celebrate and praise life's simple wonders. Morton himself is a very grateful (and lucky) man who writes songs as if he were living on borrowed time. That's because a random bug bite when he was a child left him with a monstrous case of Lyme disease that led to multiple organ failures. Morton's own father donated a kidney to save his son's life.

At 27, with a backing band of a dozen musicians, Morton and the rest of Typhoon are making some of the most poignant pop tunes around. We've been following this group for a few years now, but Typhoon has never done anything quite like what you can hear on its latest album, White Lighter. The songs are by far the best arranged and most compelling of the group's nearly 10-year run.

Somehow everyone in Typhoon not only managed to fit behind the Tiny Desk, but also managed to shine in this performance. If you're looking for music that touches your heart, that helps you appreciate the everyday, sit back and get ready for Typhoon to carry you away. --BOB BOILEN

Its self-titled debut is charged with great storytelling and amazing vocals by both Allen Tate and Lucius singers Holly Laessig and Jess Wolfe. Then there are the arrangements: little gems that turn these songs into cinematic vignettes using trumpet, sax, keyboard, violin, guitar and drums.

San Fermin is the musical vision of Ellis Ludwig-Leone, who wrote these songs with Tate's dark, rich voice in mind. Here at the Tiny Desk, Rae Cassidy makes the album's female vocal parts her own; in fact, the entire band keeps growing into these little song-worlds. I've seen San Fermin three times this year, and the songs keep gathering more power, intrigue and fire. The album provides a jumping-off point for a 2014 that promises to be huge for San Fermin. --BOB BOILEN

The group has since released a full-length album, this year's lovely If You Leave, but Daughter was kind enough to resuscitate ""Landfill"" for this stripped-down performance at the Tiny Desk. As you'll see and hear, that aforementioned gut-punch is a recurring specialty for the band: In all three of these sad, searing songs, singer Elena Tonra showcases a remarkable gift for coolly but approachably dishing out weary words that resonate and devastate. --STEPHEN THOMPSON

Vs80WYJmVaw,Matt Ulery's Loom: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"The next time you go to see live jazz in a club, and the band is playing original compositions, look closely in front of the musicians. Sometimes there'll be stands holding sheet music. There's nothing wrong with this per se, especially if the music is a bit complicated. But sometimes there'll be no need for stands, as the musicians have memorized the material. It's impressive, but it also signals a certain commitment, one borne of having rehearsed and performed together often. You frequently see this in tight bands that know what they're doing.

The Chicago bassist Matt Ulery writes beautiful music in an unpretentious way. It's intricate stuff, with interlocking parts and segmented structures. It often borrows from Eastern European scales, orchestral tone colors, folky textures. (On his backpack, he sports a SXSW patch from when he toured with a rock band called In Tall Buildings.) But it doesn't sound like calculus class, as in some other ambitious works of modern jazz. It never seems to stray too far away from pretty melody over undulating rhythms, and that deceptive simplicity sets it apart.

Last year Ulery put out a grand two-disc set of music you might call ""chamber jazz."" By A Little Light had strings, orchestral horns and singers — the whole nine yards. But he has also long done lavish on a smaller scale with a band called Loom. A rejiggered quintet lineup (note: bass clarinet, accordion) produced this year's Wake An Echo, which the band brought to our office during a brief summer tour. Listen for yourself and decide whether you think the music is as rich as this description makes it out to be. But at least note how the band was playing without sheet music — having committed to getting this overlapping, precise stuff down pat. --PATRICK JARENWATTANANON

iGZzuAatKHI,Okkervil River: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"At first blush, Okkervil River is obviously a good rock 'n' roll band, but listen closely — especially to its lyrics — and you'll hear a great rock 'n' roll band. The group has been making sharp, thoughtful music since the late '90s, with the first of its seven albums coming out a dozen years ago.

The songs in this Tiny Desk Concert are from The Silver Gymnasium, a record inspired by the childhood of 37-year-old singer-songwriter Will Sheff; he grew up a bespectacled, crooked-toothed redhead in the small New Hampshire town of Meriden. His lyrics are drenched in specific memories, pop-culture references and youthful insecurity. Look at these lines from ""Down Down the Deep River"":

Tell me 'bout the greatest show or the greatest movie you know

Or the greatest song that you taped from off the radio

Play it again and again — it cuts off at the ending, though

Tell me I'm always gonna be your best friend

Now you said it one time — why don't you say it again?

The stories pop a bit more in this acoustic set-up for Okkervil River, but they rock plenty hard in concert and on their albums. If you've missed the past dozen years of this band, start here and then work your way back through its catalog. The Stage Names is my favorite, but nothing disappoints. --BOB BOILEN

Valerie June is a singular performer with an array of singing styles. Sometimes she's channeling an old male voice; at other times, she channels a younger woman or even a child. Her music is steeped in tradition. The striking Tennessee singer — on its own, her hair could pass for sculpture — can sing the blues or gospel or country or a blend that sounds like nothing else. She learned how to sing during 18 years of church, but the ""old man's voice"" comes from deep inside in unexpected ways.

Pvw42EIZxLU,Superchunk: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"It's remarkable to think that Superchunk's career has spanned four decades. The North Carolina band got its start in 1989, and here it is in 2013, with a new record called I Hate Music that demonstrates an undying passion for punk-fueled story songs with catchy phrasing. The band recorded its 10th album with a lineup that has held for most of its history: Mac McCaughan on guitar and vocals, Laura Ballance on bass, Jim Wilbur on guitar and Jon Wurster on drums.

At the Tiny Desk and on tour, it's a shame not to have Ballance in the fold — her hearing problem worsens on tour and in loud venues — though Jason Narducy fills in admirably here. This set in the NPR Music offices includes songs from I Hate Music and 2010's Majesty Shredding, but the group also digs deep to perform a song from 1995's Here's Where the Strings Come In.

HNY2u53wUbU,Lawrence Brownlee: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"These days, Lawrence Brownlee spends most of his time on the stages of the world's great opera houses. That's where you'll find him singing Rossini and Donizetti. His supple, strong, high-flying voice can negotiate the tightest hairpin turns with grace and elegance; that, and his ability to command the stage as an actor, has won Brownlee the praise of critics worldwide.

But as much as he excels at opera, there's a special place in Brownlee's heart for African-American spirituals. Growing up in Youngstown, Ohio, Brownlee sang gospel music in church, and now he's returning to that tradition by releasing a new album, Spiritual Sketches — and singing selections from it here in the NPR Music offices.

Brownlee bases much of his operatic success on his sturdy church-music grounding. ""I would say that the flexibility I have with my voice is in large part because I sang gospel in church,"" Brownlee told NPR in 2007. ""It's a lot of improvisational singing with a lot of riffs or runs.""

The spirituals might be well-known, but through Brownlee's voice, they shine in new, occasionally jazz-inflected arrangements by Damien Sneed. ""There Is a Balm in Gilead"" floats in a newly contemplative mood with the addition of a few blue notes and chromatic touches, while the spunky piano line Justina Lee plays in ""Come By Here"" seems inspired by great stride players like James P. Johnson.

But the heart and soul of this concert is ""All Night, All Day,"" a performance that swells with a potent combination of tenderness and operatic horsepower. The song speaks of a protective band of angels — angels that Brownlee told the audience are watching over his 3-year-old son Caleb, who's just been diagnosed with an autism-spectrum disorder.

""It's called 'All Night, All Day,' but I've renamed it 'Caleb's Song,'"" Brownlee says. The soulful vocalisms with which Brownlee closes the song are gorgeous and tinged with anguish. Afterward, I heard one NPR staffer say it was the first time she'd ever wept at a Tiny Desk Concert. --TOM HUIZENGA

11po9xKBsbw,"Oliver ""Tuku"" Mtukudzi: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert","He seemed so casual — sitting on a bar stool behind the Tiny Desk, acoustic guitar in hand — but when you hear that husky voice, you'll know why he's a legend. Oliver Mtukudzi, or ""Tuku"" as his fans lovingly call him, plays spirited music, born from the soul of Zimbabwe. He's been recording since the late 1970s, with about as many albums as his age: 60.

But Mtukudzi's new record reveals a heavier heart than before: Sarawoga is his first recording since the loss of his son Sam. He and Sam — also a guitar player, as well as a saxophonist — had a special relationship touring together. But in March 2010, Sam Mtukudzi was killed in a car crash at the age of 21. Oliver Mtukudzi recently told NPR's Tell Me More that ""the only way to console myself is to carry on doing what we loved doing most. Sitting down [to] cry and mourn — I think it would have killed me.""

Ma9X4_PKctk,Hem: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Hem is one of All Songs Considered's earliest discoveries. Back in 2002, we received a beautiful and unique album called Rabbit Songs. It was a homey, fireside kind of record, with a sound that could be called country or Americana, and the arrangements by Dan Messé made it feel quaint and warm. To top it off, there was singer Sally Ellyson, an untrained natural talent with an effortless yet breathtaking voice. Hem has gone on to make five more albums since Rabbit Songs; their latest, Departure and Farewell, finds the group still writing songs that feel as if they've always been there.

I'd never met any of Hem's members since we featured them on All Songs Considered (and All Things Considered) all those years ago, but they made a point to say that those NPR stories helped keep them making music together. In turn, I'm thankful for all the wonderful music they've made in that time — and hopeful that this Tiny Desk Concert helps you discover a new musical friend with an old, special sound. --BOB BOILEN

TX8QPtpLOfA,Cristina Pato: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"After nearly a decade spent living in the city, Cristina Pato is a full-fledged New Yorker. But her first home is the place where Spain meets the Celtic world: Galicia.

Pato's instrument is the gaita, a Galician bagpipe, and her roots lie in traditional Galician music — though she also boasts graduate degrees in classical piano, music theory and electronic composition. And if you happen to think that bagpipes automatically equal St. Patrick's Day parades or Austin Powers movies, Pato would like to disabuse you of those notions: The only green she sported on the day of her Tiny Desk Concert was on the punkishly tipped ends of her hair.

Pato sets her musical vantage points far from tradition, aided by her thoroughly simpatico collaborators in this trio: accordionist and composer Victor Prieto (who, like Pato, is a native of the town of Orense in Galicia) and American percussionist Shane Shanahan (who, like Pato, is also a longtime member of Yo-Yo Ma's Silk Road Ensemble).

After the trio's set, one of our colleagues likened Pato's wailing melodies to those of Ornette Coleman. Is this world music? Is it jazz? Does it matter? Whatever you call it, it's wild and entirely wonderful. --ANASTASIA TSIOULCAS

LbVD8k9qA6k,Shovels & Rope: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Shovels & Rope's presence in the NPR Music offices attracted plenty of interest; many in attendance had long since fallen in love with the husband-and-wife duo's mix of rowdy folk-rock and rootsy balladeering. But once Cary Ann Hearst and Michael Trent showed up, the office quickly lost sight of the approaching performance, as the murmurs began: ""There's a dog in the office there's a dog in the office there's a dog in the office!"" You could practically see our coworkers' brains short out from a combination of cognitive dissonance and canine adoration.

But, as endearing as our new friend was, Shovels & Rope soon won back the crowd's attention. After opening with the plaintive ballad ""Carnival,"" the South Carolina duo ripped through one of its signature rockers — ""Birmingham,"" during which the pair held eye contact sweetly while singing in unison — before closing with ""Bad Luck,"" a clattering gem for which the two swap instruments (he on guitar, she on drums). The song, originally from a Michael Trent solo album, most recently appeared on a deluxe version of Shovels & Rope's 2012 debut, the winning and appropriately titled O' Be Joyful. --STEPHEN THOMPSON

UhMRD7lw5zs,Arturo O'Farrill: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Latin jazz works best when the musicians involved are as fluent in Afro-Cuban rhythms as they are in the deep grooves and advanced harmonics of bebop. Arturo O'Farrill has that pedigree in his DNA: His father, Chico O'Farrill, was part of a groundbreaking group of musicians who created the mash-up of Afro-Cuban music and jazz back in late-'40s New York.

The octet you see in this video is a stripped-down version of the Afro Latin Jazz Orchestra, which is at least twice as large — don't think I didn't try to get the whole band behind Bob Boilen's desk — and dedicated to both preserving the legacy of the elder O'Farrill and documenting the younger musician's efforts to move the music forward.

The musicians with whom Arturo O'Farrill surrounds himself all play with intensity that draws from both traditions. It was a thrill to hear such tremendous late-night music so early in the morning — and an honor to have O'Farrill ask me to sit in with the band and share the conga chair with Tony Rosa. Playing with musicians of this caliber always steps up your game, and on this day, I did my best and had a lot of fun in the process. --FELIX CONTRERAS

5bIlkpQRyTM,The 1975: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"As lead singer of the youthful Manchester band The 1975, Matthew Healy has cranked out a batch of enjoyably wiry songs, most notably the singles ""Chocolate"" and ""Sex"" — each of which has attracted more than a million YouTube plays. The group has been bubbling up, here and in the U.K., for the last year or two, as it's toured with Muse and released an album and four EPs full of brash-but-winsome, electronics-tinged pop-rock.

So The 1975 knows its way around bigness. But, when asked to strip his band's sound down to fit the intimate confines of the Tiny Desk, Healy didn't hesitate to transform both his songs and himself. Performing solo with a guitar — he even goes fully acoustic for his two hits — he's reborn as an earnest troubadour, while his songs now register as melancholy musings. They're remarkably sturdy in any form, as this bit of left-field sweetness amply demonstrates. --STEPHEN THOMPSON

A7My5IpEzVM,Bombino: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"There's something alluring and charming about Bombino, whose childlike face belies his fierce, hypnotic guitar playing. The first time I saw him perform, I found myself screaming his name at the end of every song — partly to praise his amazing jams, but also as an exercise in bonding. It felt as if I were yelling out to a buddy on stage, even though I'd never met him. I just felt a connection; his sound is that personable and familiar.

Omara ""Bombino"" Moctar is a Tuareg guitarist, born in Niger. The familiarity in his music stems from the blues, a common thread between American music and Africa for obvious reasons. Bombino grew up on the music of Jimi Hendrix, whose sound keeps getting sent back and forth from America to Africa and back again. The American blues-rock duo The Black Keys must have heard this upon listening to Bombino; guitarist Dan Auerbach went on to produce Nomad, Bombino's new album. But there's also an innocence to Bombino, and a sense of simple, honest discovery that shows up in his smile as he plays. You may find yourself screaming his name, too, after watching this performance. --BOB BOILEN

gkYnVE5jsAo,Baths: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Baths, a.k.a. Will Wiesenfeld, plays mysterious and textured electronic music. When Wiesenfeld came to the Tiny Desk, I expected contemplative tones and a laid-back performance; he does, after all, call his project Baths. But what sets him apart from the vast majority of like-minded performers is that his music doesn't get buried behind the buttons or lost in a hypnotic glaze.

Wiesenfeld is an extrovert live, and at the Tiny Desk, he sounds vibrant and compelling as he performs songs from this year's Obsidian. His partner Morgan Greenwood, an accomplished music-maker in his own right, keeps the music dense but frees up Wiesenfeld to sing with few distractions; there's a mind-meld between the two that's undeniable. They're not accustomed to playing in the light of day, but they enchant in this perfect introduction to their work. --BOB BOILEN

2bMVMjOMRkU,Steve Gunn: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"""Do you know of any good liquor stores in town? Or, better yet, record stores?"" Steve Gunn asks me after playing a mesmerizing set at the NPR Music offices. He's a record collector with insatiable taste and a vinyl-packed apartment. His ears perk up when I tell him that Future Times co-owner Andrew Field-Pickering (a.k.a. Maxillion Dunbar) stocks the electronic jams at Joe's Record Paradise, and that Red Onion Records is never without a stellar jazz and folk section. Maybe bits and pieces of those sounds hit the guitarist's music, but his work mostly stems from a bushy, overgrown definition of what we often call ""Americana,"" with a healthy understanding of the La Monte Young drone.

Grateful Dead and J.J. Cale certainly reside in the rubber-band bounce of ""Old Strange,"" a song that keeps the groove mellow, but will suddenly pop with water-drop elasticity. ""The Lurker"" comes from a much longer solo guitar version that originally sounded like one of Roy Harper's acoustic epics, but with Gunn's trio, it becomes a back-porch barn-burner. Both songs appear on Gunn's latest album, Time Off — a perfect record for goofing off, taking it easy, or whatever lazy tendencies summer tends to inspire. Mostly, though, it just inspires you to take time and listen. --LARS GOTRICH

-qryg2q3lUs,Buika: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Concha Buika's voice doesn't come from inside her petite body: It comes from Africa, and from the past. There are obvious traces of flamenco, itself a historical mash-up of the Moors and various transitory cultures in southern Spain and north Africa.

During her flights of improvisation, we also hear the influence of Cuban vocalist Celia Cruz, a product of Afro-Cuban culture, mixed in with Ella Fitzgerald, who was the pinnacle of African-American jazz vocal expression.

In these two performances, we hear Buika interpret her own lyrics after a handful of albums in which she's interpreted others' words. With her eyes closed tightly, she inhabits these poems of love and heartache as if she were reliving them again before our eyes.

Buika's singular voice has attracted a cadre of fans who've become enchanted by her voice and her leave-it-all-on-the-stage performances in clubs and theaters around the world. Watch this video and join the club. --FELIX CONTRERAS

pc8U2VP92Vg,The Front Bottoms: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"When I first saw The Front Bottoms, I was stunned, as 350-plus singing/shouting clubgoers repeating compassionate verse after complicated verse back at singer Brian Sella. And then it happened again at a hot sweaty club in Philadelphia, and later in D.C., and then again in Baltimore. The community that's formed around these songs, total strangers purging deep emotions in a public space. It's a beautiful phenomena, a testament to the passion and compassion that this band radiates. A testament to the nerve that's gets pinged with lines cried out, 'I wanna be stronger than your dad was for your mom' or the phrase in one of this years best songs 'Twin Sized Mattress' ""

I wanna contribute to the chaos

I don't wanna watch and then complain

'Cause I am through finding blame

That is the decision that I have made

And when you hear the music...uncomplicated but pretty memorable, you realize that the talent in this band isn't about instrument craft and years of playing scales...this is about the shortest distance from emotion, sometimes complex and storied emotion, from band to audience. At the Tiny Desk in the bright of day and with office lights on, it was a tough to get the call and response that happens in a darkened late night room, but it's not hard to look at the faces in this band, especially the sweet smile of Brian, to understand this band. Their new record Talon of the Hawk is certainly on my year end list for all these reasons. It's all about heart and soul, something frequently avoided and hard to convey. --BOB BOILEN

JaoUMbHvsc0,Mother Falcon: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"When it comes to Tiny Desk Concerts, we're suckers for milestones at NPR Music: We're gearing up to acknowledge No. 300, for example, and are constantly taking note of the first time a musician trots out a particular rare instrument or does something else no one has done in front of us before. The Austin chamber-rock band Mother Falcon recently scored a big distinction, at least as far as we're concerned — one it shares with its fellow Texans in The Polyphonic Spree — as the largest ensemble ever to squeeze behind Bob Boilen's desk.

Unlike The Polyphonic Spree, though, everyone in Mother Falcon plays an instrument during this performance: There's no chorus of backup singers among the 17 men and women who play guitars and horns and keyboards and woodwinds and strings here. Which made Tetris-ing each member behind Bob's desk a bit of a challenge, but Mother Falcon knows its way around cramped spaces: At one point during SXSW this year, Bob and I saw the group give a concert as it spilled from a small stage all the way onto the street outside. (Crowds gathered around both spaces, in some cases not realizing that they were only seeing half a band.)

What makes Mother Falcon so alluring, though, isn't its size, but rather the way it uses all its members in the service of great, snappy, stirring, frequently uplifting songs. Its many moving parts aren't creating mere volume, but also texture: These three songs, all from this year's You Knew, find a place for dreamy whispers and literal screams alike. Give this sweet, winning band 12 minutes — heck, give it the first two and a half, which is all it takes to perform the soaring and scrappy ""Marigold"" — and you ought to have yourself a favorite worth following for years to come. --STEPHEN THOMPSON

That's a lot of ingredients to strip down to a semi-acoustic set in the NPR Music offices; there's virtually no margin for error.

Thankfully, the two women at the band's heart possess gorgeously interlocking, harmony-intensive voices that require no sweeteners. Alpine's debut album, the brightly catchy A Is For Alpine, is a high-gloss studio production, which only helps make this four-song set — recorded at 9 o'clock at night to kick off an after-hours party on a nearby NPR roof deck — an essential companion piece.

7_qK8l4tDog,Jim Guthrie: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"We've had bands from all over the world visit the Tiny Desk. Most recently, we published a set by Keaton Henson, who was in from London. Back in May, we had singer M.R. Shajarian from Iran. There was the Danish band Efterklang, the Algerian singer Souad Massi and French composer Yann Tiersen. But before hosting singer Jim Guthrie earlier this summer, we'd never had a artist visit the U.S. solely to play the Tiny Desk.

Guthrie and a small army of backing musicians packed themselves into a van and drove down from their home in Ontario just to have a moment behind Bob Boilen's desk. ""We drove nine hours,"" Guthrie told the audience. ""So feel free to clap loud and clap often, because we've only got three songs here."" When they finished those three songs, Guthrie and the rest of his band got back in the van and drove straight home.

Driving a total of 18 hours to play three songs might seem ridiculous, but Guthrie is no stranger to putting in time. He took 10 years between his last record, 2003's Now, More Than Ever, and this year's appropriately titled follow-up, Takes Time, a collection of wistful pop with sweet harmonies and uplifting, infectious melodies. The wait was worth it. Here, Guthrie and his band perform three standout tracks from Takes Time. --ROBIN HILTON

34bgjdQRjIM,Time For Three: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Pigeonholing the classically trained string trio Time for Three isn't easy, but that's also a blessing. The musicians — violinists Zachary De Pue and Nick Kendall with double bassist Ranaan Meyer — say they love a kaleidoscopic spectrum of music. ""If we like it, we play it"" is their motto. That's why you'll find them riffing on Daft Punk and Kanye West in their popular anti-bullying video or blending Bach and Bon Iver at a Macy's. Their own compositions tend to swing wildly among pop, bluegrass and jazz.

Meyer, De Pue and Kendall don't act like your average classical conservatory grads (they met at the esteemed Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia). They come off as just three high-spirited dudes in a band — a ""classically trained garage band,"" as they like to say. But they certainly don't play like it. Watching them weave together the colorful strands of their music, as they huddle behind Bob Boilen's desk, it's hard not to be swept up in the force of their staggering technique and contagious energy.

What fuels that energy, at least in part, is a strong urge to improvise. ""Intuitively, we create a structure and then loosen the vibe up when appropriate,"" De Pue says.

You can feel it, along with the sheer joy of playing, in the opening tune ""Banjo Love,"" in which two contrary violin solos get support from Meyer's expressively propulsive bass. ""Sundays,"" with its slowly unfolding melodies, is a wistful homage to a weekend hangover. And the onomatopoetic ""Don Don"" spirals out as a funky, high-octane hoedown wherein violins chase each other while Meyer counterpunches the side of his bass.

These three short tunes are brimming with surprises. When the set ended, I longed for at least one more, just to find out what the band would come up with next. --TOM HUIZENGA

RZNrWmf4xH0,Keaton Henson: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"The day before Keaton Henson arrived to play the Tiny Desk, we hosted a group called The No BS! Brass Band, a nearly dozen-piece horn section with an almost brutal (and totally amazing) sound. It was one of the loudest and most thrilling, heart-pounding Tiny Desk sets we've ever had.

Keaton Henson's performance could not have been more unlike the show the day before. When a cozy crowd of curious listeners showed up the next day to see him play, I asked everyone to get as close as they could, without freaking out the admittedly shy singer from London. Don't let the presence of this fantastic recording (by our engineer Kevin Wait) fool you. Henson's voice was so fragile and hushed, if you were 10 feet away you would have barely heard a peep from him.

But what Henson's music lacked in volume, it more than made up for in feeling. If the No BS! Brass Band was one of the boldest Tiny Desk shows, his was among the most moving. As I mentioned back in April, when we introduced a video for his song ""You,"" he has one of the most beautiful, arresting voices I've heard.

Remarkably, Henson has only been playing music for a couple years; he took up the guitar to help heal his broken heart after a failed relationship. He's also a poet and illustrator who's released one graphic novel called Gloaming and is already at work on another.

For this Tiny Desk performance, Henson performed three songs from his new album, Birthdays. --ROBIN HILTON

When I first saw this group in concert, I was struck by its physical similarity to Cults: a whole lot of long black hair, for starters, with a man and woman at the front of each band. It all made sense when I learned that Richie Follin of Guards and Madeline Follin of Cults are brother and sister, and that Richie played guitar in Cults for a bit. In fact, the first set of songs he wrote and demoed were meant for Cults.

Earlier this year, Guards' first album came out, titled In Guards We Trust. These are sturdy pop songs with hooks that build and won't let go. And the band's Tiny Desk Concert is a great way to hear Guards for the first time, if you haven't already dug in. --BOB BOILEN

fS9uUDslHso,Cheyenne Mize: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"In the years since she first surfaced as a suitably rustic duet partner for Will Oldham — the two Kentuckians released an EP together back in 2010 — Cheyenne Mize has broadened and deepened her sound, injecting it with slinkiness and sparkle. Her new album Among the Grey continues that evolution, bringing out the lushness in songs that can shimmer prettily or punch with the force of a PJ Harvey.

Behind Bob Boilen's desk at the NPR Music offices, Mize — a multi-talented singer, instrumentalist and music therapist — reduces her band to a duo for three songs from Among the Grey. Naturally, this entailed showcasing some of the album's the quieter, moodier moments (the slinky ""Raymaker,"" the dreamy ""Whole Heart"") before closing with the more forceful ""Wait for It."" But along the way, Mize's voice rings out assertively in every style and setting.

5xNy40dQCNQ,Alice Russell: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"There's nothing restrained about Alice Russell's performance. It's emotionally fiery from the start and gets hotter and grittier, especially when she's singing ""To Dust,"" the title track to her first new album in almost five years.

Alice Russell is a classic soul infused singer — close your eyes and it's easy to hear a southern drawl, but surprisingly, she's a Brit. American infused R&B from Britain has a long history going back to the 1960s with Dusty Springfield and including 21st century artists like Adele and Alice Russell. Alice Russell also tends to include a dose of electronica in her arrangements. Russell has been making great soul music for 10 plus years. To Dust is her fifth album. Which may be the only reason too many people don't yet know this artist. This stuff is as powerful as any American singer singing soul in the 21st century.

nF3U_t3yjic,Frank Turner: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Frank Turner writes folk songs that harness the fury of punk and the majesty of Springsteenian rock 'n' roll. But more than anything else, his music is playful: There's conversational wit and bite to Turner's music, even as he's bellowing to the back rows. His songs lose little when you strip away electric instruments and leave the entertainment value to a single skinny, tattooed guy with an acoustic guitar.

For his Tiny Desk close-up, the U.K. singer-songwriter isn't actually alone — he brings along the pianist in his band The Sleeping Souls, Matt Nasir, who joins in on mandolin — but Turner still does plenty to convey the bawdy rowdiness of a full band on his own. Opening with the terrifically anthemic, rehab-themed first single from his new album Tape Deck Heart (sample line: ""On the first night we met, you said, 'Well, darling, let's make a deal/If anybody ever asks us, let's just tell them that we met in jail'""), Turner shines in what may well be the most brightly lit performance space he's ever graced. --STEPHEN THOMPSON

WV0xX1hAJok,Skinny Lister: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"I wish I could say I first found Skinny Lister in a pub some late evening while folks were dancing on the tables. I trust that that happens, but my unforgettable experience with this kick-ass English folk-punk band was at a hotel lobby in midday, in the midst of a sober crowd in Austin, Texas.

I was coming back to my hotel during SXSW 2013 in hopes of grabbing a short nap when I saw Lorna Thomas winning the hearts of a gathering crowd with her flirtatious, cheer-me-up style of singing and dancing. Then my eyes and ears found a punkish band with accordion, upright bass, guitars, and vocals from Dan Heptinstall. I couldn't leave, I never napped, and I fell head over clicking heels for their reels and jigs and whatever else they tossed our way.

When it was done, I shook their hands, gave them high-fives and hugs, and handed them my card. Months later, they showed up at my desk early in the day bearing lots of beer, some mysterious alcohol in an even-more-mysterious jug, and an assortment of instruments. After watching this Tiny Desk Concert, when you're ready for more and you can't find Skinny Lister playing your local pub, you can check out its debut album, Forge & Flagon — it'll tide you over until the band makes it back to your town. --BOB BOILEN

eT5DJ33-Fbg,Laura Mvula: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Listen to Laura Mvula's terrific full-length debut, Sing to the Moon, and you'll hear soulful pop music in Technicolor. The U.K. singer's sonic ambition is boundless: Her intricately layered songs straddle genres, locations and eras in ways that sound entirely original.

Squeezing that sound behind Bob Boilen's desk is no tiny task, as she acknowledges partway through this three-song set in the NPR Music offices. Mvula faces the challenge by seizing an opportunity to showcase her most intimate material; with the help of a small string section, she forgoes some of her flashier songs (""Like the Morning Dew,"" ""Green Garden"") in favor of Sing to the Moon's most brooding ballads.

The result shines a spotlight squarely on Mvula's lovely voice and elegant songwriting — both of which are sturdy enough to withstand being stripped of accoutrements. Soak up this performance, then treat yourself to Sing to the Moon if you haven't already. It's one of the best debut albums in a year full of great ones. --STEPHEN THOMPSON

ykEnSrhinvs,Cheick Hamala Diabate: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"There was an awful lot of dancing going on the first time I stumbled upon the music of Cheick Hamala Diabate. On the dance floor at U Street's Tropicalia that night was a rich cross-section of D.C. life, all entranced by the music of Mali.

Malian tradition lies at the heart and foot-stomping soul of Cheick Hamala Diabate and his band, but their melodies and undeniable rhythms cut across age and ethnicity. Diabate primarily plays the ngoni and the banjo; think of the ngoni as a great-grandfather to the banjo and it all makes sense, because both instruments share the ability to convey melody and plucked percussive rhythm.

Diabate is from Kita in Mali and born into a family of griots, or storytellers; his first cousin is the legendary kora player Toumani Diabate. Cheick Hamala Diabate makes his home these days in a Maryland suburb a few miles over the D.C. line, and his musicians are American-born and inspired by this lively lyrical music, which often tells a tale about Mali and its people as part of the sway and shake. It's an honor to witness such a cross-section of cultures finding a common bond in music. --BOB BOILEN

She's a brilliant cellist with a stunning command of her instrument, and she's tightly tied to technology. Beiser takes the sound of her cello and runs it through loop pedals, effects and other electronics to make her instrument shimmer, drone and groove. Then there's her magnificent sense of melody.

It's not unusual to want to run in the other direction when you hear the words ""experimental music,"" but Beiser's is an experiment that works. Time Loops, her 2012 album, is one of that year's hidden gems.

Her warm, wise voice is comforting, inviting and relatable, even — perhaps especially — as she tackles weighty subjects like middle age and the death of a parent.

The memory of Griffin's father hangs over her recent seventh album, American Kid, but the singer remains far too resourceful to make it a collection of navel-gazing dirges about mortality. In sampling a few of the record's many highlights at the NPR Music offices, she takes care to balance the exquisite mourning of ""Faithful Son"" — and the sweetly somber ""That Kind of Lonely,"" which Griffin describes as ""a song about finally letting go of your delayed adolescence"" — by closing her set with the playfully bawdy, kindly celebratory ""Get Ready Marie."" Inspired by a favorite photo of her grandparents, the song finds Griffin viewing two complicated lives with the generous, hopeful eye she's been casting on her subjects for three fruitful decades now. --STEPHEN THOMPSON

q2OnQR6VMwU,Billy Bragg: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"OK Go helped us move the Tiny Desk from our old building to NPR's new headquarters, and The National performed the first full new-building Tiny Desk Concert we posted to the site, but Billy Bragg gave us the first full Tiny Desk Concert we actually recorded in our new office.

Bragg, one of the world's finest contemporary folksingers, appropriately sang ""Handyman Blues"" as his first tune — and was quickly met with lot of hammering on our rooftop by some real handymen as they put the finishing touches on NPR's new home.

Bragg, along with Dobro player C.J. Hillman, also channeled the spirit of legendary American folksinger Woody Guthrie, with whom Bragg collaborated — albeit posthumously, in Guthrie's case — when he took Guthrie's unsung words and set them to song with the help of Wilco. Here, he takes a song Guthrie himself co-opted and altered: a gospel tune (""This World Is Not My Home"") he'd turned into an anthem against inaction.

In ""I Ain't Got No Home,"" Bragg follows in the folk tradition by altering the song to address the issue of universal health care. It's a rare talent to make it work, but Bragg, as always, finds a way to blend politics and music with grace, charm and a rough edge. --BOB BOILEN

MEjNggZsWow,No BS! Brass Band: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Just southeast of the Virginia Commonwealth University campus in Richmond, Va., lies a compact neighborhood called Oregon Hill. Historically, it's been a (white) working-class part of town, affordable for students and various bohemian types. Recording engineer Lance Koehler was drawn to the place when he moved to Richmond from New Orleans; it's where he eventually found a two-story garage and converted it into his own recording studio and home. It didn't take him long to start doing business across the Richmond music map: Koehler is good at his job, and he's affordable. His business is called Minimum Wage Studios for a reason.

He's also a drummer, and though he grew up in Southern California, his time in New Orleans left a deep impression. Inspired by the Crescent City's modern brass bands, in 2006 he started the NO BS! Brass Band with trombonist Reggie Pace. They had a place to fit between 10 and 13 musicians for rehearsal, and they had the means to document their work. And, owing to VCU and its conservatory program — with a history of producing top-notch jazz players — they had plenty of great horn players at their disposal.

Funky and danceable, the NO BS! Brass Band takes after the full black-music continuum you hear in groups like Rebirth or the Hot 8. But it's also proggy, and a bit brutalizing, and full of pride in a different Southern outpost. The group's new album is called RVA All Day, after all. And about that jazz cred: In July, it'll release another album called Fight Song, so named because it features the band's arrangements of Charles Mingus compositions.

Recently, Koehler, Pace and nine other musicians piled into a bus and journeyed up the freeway to NPR Music's Tiny Desk in Washington, D.C. They blasted us with songs from the new album — it was so loud, you could hear the music on the other side of the building, a floor down. And this summer, when Pace isn't out with Bon Iver's touring band, they'll strike out from Oregon Hill to fly the Richmond flag up and down the East Coast.

TdFCD3oXMZo,The National: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"The first thing you might notice about this video is the change in surroundings: NPR recently moved to a new building, and though we worked to make the Tiny Desk as visually similar as possible to the old space — a process we recently documented with the help of OK Go — the ceilings are higher, the square footage more generous and the surfaces lavishly unsullied. The visuals will surely evolve in the months and years to come, as more tchotchkes and coffee stains accumulate on, around and behind Bob Boilen's desk.

In the days leading up to this hotly anticipated performance by The National — recorded at the obscenely early time (for touring bands anyway) of 10:30 in the morning — we'd gotten word that the group would strip its sound way down for the occasion, sticking to two acoustic guitars and a bit of hand percussion. What we got instead was a fully fleshed-out septet, complete with horns and piano; the band showed up at 9:30 to rehearse and sound-check.

Though singer Matt Berninger had barely rested his voice from a show in the area the night before, The National dutifully performed gorgeous acoustic renditions of four tracks from its fine new album, Trouble Will Find Me. Its members even treated the hundreds of worshipful gawkers to Building 2.0's first-ever Tiny Desk encore, in response to a roar of applause that could be heard in the far reaches of the newsroom downstairs.

Wm63LibDiFk,OK Go: An NPR Tiny Desk Concert In 223 Takes,"The Tiny Desk has moved, and OK Go has helped make it so.

Earlier this year, we needed to figure out the best possible way to move my Tiny Desk from NPR's old headquarters to our new facility just north of the U.S. Capitol. We wanted to go out with a bang and arrive at our new space in style, so our thoughts naturally turned to a catchy pop band we love: OK Go, whose unforgettable videos have been viewed tens of millions of times on YouTube.

Bandleader Damian Kulash used to be an engineer at an NPR member station in Chicago, so we figured he'd be up for helping us execute a simple idea: Have OK Go start performing a Tiny Desk Concert at our old location, continue playing the same song while the furniture and shelving is loaded onto a truck, and finish the performance at our new home. In addition to cameos by many of our NPR colleagues — Ari Shapiro, Audie Cornish, David Greene, Guy Raz, Scott Simon, Alix Spiegel, Susan Stamberg and more — this required a few ingredients:

    Number of video takes: 223

    Percent used in final version: 50

    Number of raw audio channels: 2,007

    Percent used in final version: 50

    Number of microphones: 5

    Number of hard-boiled eggs consumed: 8, mostly by bassist Tim Nordwind

    Number of seconds Carl Kasell spent in the elevator with OK Go: 98

    Number of times Ari Shapiro played the tubular bells: 15

    Number of pounds the tubular bells weighed: 300

    Number of times the shelves were taken down and put back up: 6

    Number of days it took to shoot: 2

    Number of cameras: 1

OK Go played ""All Is Not Lost"" from Of the Blue Colour of the Sky, with words tweaked by the All Songs Considered team. And so begins a new era for the Tiny Desk, after 277 concerts (counting this one) in our old home. -- BOB BOILEN

GnI4R9Bdl3g,Mohammad Reza Shajarian: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Every Tiny Desk Concert provides its own particular thrill, but it's not every day that we get to welcome one of NPR's 50 Great Voices to our offices. With the visit of the incredible, honey-voiced Mohammad Reza Shajarian from Iran, we lucked out by having him sing on not just any day, but on the biggest holiday of the Persian calendar: Nowruz, the New Year.

Joined by three excellent collaborators, brothers Sohrab and Tahmoures Pournazeri (celebrated musicians in their own right as leaders of Iran's Shams Ensemble) and French percussionist Robin Vassy, Ostad (""Master"") Shajarian gave what amounted to a brief master class in the art of singing. In the course of this love song, titled ""Az Eshgh,"" Shajarian unleashed torrents of swooping, soaring, goosebump-inducing sound — still perfectly controlled at age 73.

Over the past several years, Shajarian has emerged as a strong voice in other ways. Though he's been an artistic icon for decades at home, he was never particularly outspoken on political issues. But since the Green movement began in Iran in the wake of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's reelection in June 2009, Shajarian has openly made reference to supporting the opposition, and has demanded that state-run media stop using his songs in their broadcasts and films. Those moves carry a heavy cost: He has been effectively barred from performing live in Iran, and instead now spends most of his time touring the world to diaspora and non-Iranian audiences alike. But at his heart, Shajarian is a great artist, not a politician — and perhaps now, even more will have the chance to experience his brilliant beauty and power as a singer. -- ANASTASIA TSIOULCAS

ggIwlQ5u0a4,Buddy Miller & Jim Lauderdale: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"There's something endearing, old-timey and almost vaudevillian about Buddy Miller and Jim Lauderdale — even the way they bill themselves as ""Buddy and Jim."" Both veteran musicians are in love with country music in all its many forms and influences; their music incorporates the blues and bluegrass, rock 'n' roll and a good deal of craft.

Buddy Miller is the guitar player to hire if you're playing heartfelt, not-so-shiny country-rock songs. Ask Robert Plant and Alison Krauss, with whom Miller toured for their Raising Sand tour, or Emmylou Harris, Shawn Colvin and Patty Griffin, who named their tour together ""Three Girls and Their Buddy.""

Jim Lauderdale writes award-winning country songs — hits for George Strait, Patty Loveless and the Dixie Chicks. He'll once again host the Americana Music Awards alongside Miller, with whom he shares a radio show on Sirius XM's Outlaw Country Channel; that's where the corny humor comes in. You'll hear some of that in this Tiny Desk Concert, but you'll also hear musical merrymaking and timeless harmonies, with songs from their first full-album collaboration, Buddy and Jim.

The songs they performed, at NPR's offices and on the album, have titles like ""I Lost My Job [insert pregnant pause here] of Loving You."" Some good fun to be had at the expense of heartbreak and life's loves, both lost and found. --BOB BOILEN

m1-Si874NWw,Nicola Benedetti: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"You might never tell by her youth or her warm and approachable demeanor, but 26-year-old Scottish violinist Nicola Benedetti has already had an extraordinary career. Mentored by Yehudi Menuhin starting at age 10, Benedetti won the BBC Young Musician of the Year Award a decade ago — and, really, that was just a warm-up.

Benedetti has since become an international performer of note: She's recently appeared as soloist with groups like the New York Philharmonic, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the San Francisco Symphony, and she was given the huge honor of playing the last night of the Proms in London last summer. But Benedetti just might be best appreciated in an up-close-and-personal setting, whether she's performing or working with kids, which is one of her greatest passions; she's a proud ""big sister"" to El Sistema Scotland.

At this Tiny Desk Concert, though, she's simply radiant. Maybe that's partly due to her affable and gracious personality, or to her huge and sweet tone, enhanced by the 1717 Gariel Strad she plays. (It's worth some $10 million.) Or maybe it's the way she lets John Williams' theme from Schindler's List spin out in such aching fashion, or the way she makes room for silence in Bach's Chaconne before tearing deep into its dense warp and weft. In any case, she's enchanting. --ANASTASIA TSIOULCAS

Z64OB3NiXFQ,Father Figures: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"In a small, packed Washington, D.C., living room late one December night, I heard a cacophony of horns, keys, drums and guitars that simply floored me. It was brash, zany, brainy, scary and danceable. At the end of a long year of amazing live music, this would turn out to be one of the most memorable concerts I'd seen.

I walked up to Adam Schatz, the man behind the saxophone and chief instigator in Father Figures, and told him his band needed to play the Tiny Desk. How this music would translate to the brightness of day — to say nothing of a busy office — was hard to anticipate. But from the moment the band squeaked its first squawk, it was clear that it would conjure up an adventure. These guys mix rock and jazz the way King Crimson did at its fiercest.

Father Figures formed at New York University in 2007 with Adam Schatz on sax and effects, Jas Walton on sax, Spencer Zahn on upright bass, Ian Chang on drums and Ross Edwards on keyboards. If they come to a club or living room near you, drop all plans and go. This video is just the beginning.

RJMQkye_YTw,Omar Sosa & Paolo Fresu: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"You don't really listen to an Omar Sosa concert so much as experience it. The Cuban-born pianist's overall demeanor exudes a sense of calm and deep reflection, while a spiritual connection to music and his ancestors comes through in his piano playing.

You can hear Sosa draw on more than 100 years of Cuban piano in the recognizable rhythms of his country's music. But in Sosa's hands, it's not all fiery and bombastic; he's most effective when he uses Afro-Cuban tradition as a guide to his distinct, subtle and nuanced approach.

In Paolo Fresu, Sosa has found a sympathetic musical partner. Fresu's work on trumpet and flugelhorn provides a perfect foil for Sosa's introspective intersection of jazz, Afro-Cuban sounds and a chamber-music mentality.

Sosa and Fresu's quietly energetic performance behind Bob Boilen's desk enveloped everyone in attendance like a soft mist. Fresu's use of digital delay never clashed with Sosa' acoustic piano, instead adding another color to the palette; at times, Fresu uses it to add a layer of rhythm with either the ring on his finger or a blowing technique into his horn.

Omar Sosa and Paolo Fresu were as much fun to watch as they were to hear. Watch this Tiny Desk Concert and see for yourself. --FELIX CONTRERAS

Gbjo5-lxzIs,Efterklang: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Bands with big ideas work well at the Tiny Desk. Efterklang is a Danish group whose recent album Piramida took its members to an abandoned mining town between the North Pole and Norway. There, they recorded sounds of empty oil tanks, old pianos and pretty much anything they could strike or record.

It's precisely that creative energy that led to Efterklang ransacking our kitchen utensils and desks in search of sound-making material. The band is a joy to witness live with a small orchestra, but it's equally compelling just the way it is here, huddled around my desk and trying ideas it's never tried.

o5hg3iuoJoM,Martin Hayes & Dennis Cahill: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"You're about to watch one of the best fiddlers on the planet and a subtle guitar master work their magic. For too many of us, Irish music is something that merely gets trotted out around this time of year, associated with St. Patrick's Day and the coming of spring — and made a cliche by commercialism and whatever other shallow notions make cliches what they are.

But for a moment, stop, put aside your notion of jigs and reels, and just listen. Martin Hayes plays his fiddle with an exquisite touch and tone, as well as a magnificent sense of melody and rhythm that never ceases to astonish.

I'm a year-round Irish-music guy. I've spent many summers at Celtic-music camps trying to improve my mediocre guitar skills and enjoying late-night Irish music sessions. I've seen Hayes at these camps as a teacher and performer; his playing has brought me to tears at times, and at others has made me burst out with joyful laughter. I couldn't be prouder to have him perform for us.

Hayes has worked with many accompanying musicians, and some are equal partners, but with Dennis Cahill you get delicate support. It's a rhythm that keeps the tune in; that accents and colors it but never overtakes it. It's brilliant restraint that serves the music and perfectly suits his parter. So with fresh ears, come join us in a rare treat with a familiar sound. --BOB BOILEN

zJyf5NqiMNE,The Lone Bellow: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"After hearing The Lone Bellow's self-titled debut, I couldn't wait to play it for friends and on All Songs Considered — I knew people would love it. Still, honestly, I was unprepared for the stunning power of the band's live show. When you see this Tiny Desk Concert, I'm sure you'll experience the same sensation I did. The Lone Bellow features three brilliant players, with Zach Williams singing every word as if it's the last time he'll ever get the chance. He's got a bit of Springsteen in him; it's the sort of delivery I was sure couldn't get more intense, until it does.

Kanene Pipkin and Brian Elmquist aren't just supporting players; they're vital. Their voices harmonize with Williams', sometimes making vocal power chords and at other times supplying delicate textures. Pipkin's mandolin and Elmquist's guitar create melodies and rhythms that seem a lot bigger than 14 unamplified strings normally make.

Williams began writing songs not too many years back while living in Georgia, inspired by tragedy — a riding accident that left his young wife temporarily paralyzed. That inspiration and undeniable heart comes through in every song. I'm so glad we got The Lone Bellow on the rise, because I have a feeling they're about to get very, very busy. --BOB BOILEN

xJwyBBcP51A,Mary Halvorson Quintet: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Today, when you see a saxophonist and a trumpeter in front of a jazz group, it's par for the course. It's a particular combination that's defined many landmark recordings: Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, Ornette Coleman and Don Cherry, John Coltrane andMiles Davis. Done right, it's a classic meat-and-potatoes sound: open to reinvention, comfortable with tradition.
Guitarist Mary Halvorson didn't come to this standard practice just by playing standards. As a sidewoman, she's often tapped to play in open improvising situations; her mentors include the unclassifiable composer Anthony Braxton and the free-jazz guitarist/bassist Joe Morris. Among her sonic signatures are craggy distortions, bent strings and delay-pedaled blurts through a hollow-body guitar.
Yet Halvorson has now recorded two albums with her quintet, one with alto saxophone (Jon Irabagon) and trumpet (Jonathan Finlayson) up top. (The rhythm section is also among New York's finest, with John Hebert on bass and Ches Smith on drums.) From the way her songs balance order and entropy, you can hear that she's studied how golden-era hard bop blended those voices, and how later generations morphed, rephrased and imploded those ideas.
We thought we'd spring this particular sound of surprise on the Tiny Desk. So when they showed up in town to perform, we invited Mary Halvorson and her quintet to NPR Music's headquarters, where they got comfortable enough to get rad.

wlQEPlj5JAA,Night Beds: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Winston Yellen didn't start singing until he was 18 — he's 23 now — but he's already got one of 2013's most arresting new voices. As the singer for the country-rock group Night Beds, Yellen often performs a cappella, with tremendous soul and nuance.

We thought Yellen might show up for this Tiny Desk set by himself — all the better to show off that amazing voice, with maybe just his own guitar as backup. But he opted to go all-in with the full Night Beds touring band, including lap steel and keys. The resulting performance was both lighthearted and deeply affecting.

Fortunately, you still get a chance to hear Yellen's voice in the clear: The group kicked off its four-song set with ""Faithful Heights,"" the a cappella opening track from Night Beds' full-length debut, Country Sleep. The song segues seamlessly to ""Ramona,"" followed by ""22,"" before the set closes with with ""Hide From It,"" an unreleased song.

As Night Beds' members were packing up after their performance, I asked Yellen if he ever has to work on his voice or if he was just born with it — I'd assumed the latter. ""I actually just started taking voice lessons,"" he said. ""I knew I could be so much better before heading out for this tour.""

It's hard to imagine it sounding any better.

6I0Dk8cdfCA,Cantus: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Is there some kind of weird vocal vortex in Minnesota? The state turns out so many excellent choral groups — at the school, church and professional levels — that it can arguably be dubbed the choral center of the U.S.

The members of the male vocal ensemble called Cantus, who huddled around Bob Boilen's desk to sing for us, hail from that vortex — specifically Minneapolis-St. Paul.

A quick note on the group's name, because it's more appropriate than you might think. ""Cantus"" means ""singing"" in Latin, but it also refers to an old European tradition. A student group who gathered to sing traditional songs and drink beer was once called a ""cantus."" And this modern-day group of Minnesotans indeed got its start in 1995 as a student singing group at St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minn. They didn't tell us much about the beer, though.

Cantus went professional in 2000 and has cut 15 albums on its own label. Unlike some choral groups who specialize in one style of music, Cantus prides itself on diversity. Just take a look at the three songs its members chose for this concert.

""Wanting Memories"" is a song steeped in African-American culture, written by Ysaye Barnwell from Sweet Honey in the Rock. ""Zikr,"" composed by A.R. Rahman — the same guy who scored the hit movie Slumdog Millionaire — has roots in the Sufi tradition, where deep chords and repeated phrases signal a slow burn toward religious ecstasy. And the group closes with German composer Franz Biebl's gorgeous ""Ave Maria,"" a signature piece for the group that blends traditional plainsong (or chant) with delicate melody and voluptuous harmonies that ascend heavenward.

Listening to Cantus, you understand that there's something about a group of people singing that touches listeners on a very human level. Perhaps it explains why so many of us sing — and not just in the shower. Chorus America estimates that 42.6 million American adults and children sing in choirs. (A lot of them live in Minnesota!)

For the rest of us, whose pipes aren't quite that golden? We've always got excellent groups like Cantus to do the singing for us.

""Wanting Memories"" (Ysaye Barnwell)
""Zikr"" (A.R. Rahman)

3-03z36Is6M,The xx: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"It's easy to think of The xx as a fashionable band: Its members have a sleek all-in-black look, its typography and cover art is coolly and distinctively styled, and the group itself has been showered with validation, including Britain's 2010 Mercury Prize. But beneath all that tightly controlled image-making lays music that's raw and vulnerable; shy, worried tentativeness is wired into a sound that shimmers powerfully, but remains as fragile and delicate as a soap bubble.

The xx's second album, Coexist, came out last fall, and it plays like a series of tensely lovely interludes, each building to a climax that never arrives. Plopped in front of Bob Boilen's desk and asked to play a few songs from the record, singer-guitarist Romy Madley Croft and singer-bassist Oliver Sim have reason to look slightly ill-at-ease: The setting and band configuration robs them of cover. No beats from member Jamie Smith, who opted to hang back at the hotel; no shroud of darkness or bright lights pointed outward to blunt the crowd's stares. Throughout their characteristically compact seven-minute performance, Croft and Sim avoid eye contact, as they visibly try to ignore the huge throng and cameras positioned maybe 10 feet away from them.

What comes out of their performance is not just beauty, but humanity — the sense that, in all of The xx's songs, all the calm chilliness in the world can't quite contain an exposed heart.

_rf7Gw0mj7I,Of Montreal: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"About halfway into Of Montreal's Tiny Desk Concert in the NPR Music offices, I showed a friend a Post-It note on which I'd just scribbled, ""Was I wrong to expect more of a decadent, pan-sexual carnival?"" I'd thought we were going to need to throw plastic sheeting over our desks, like at a GWAR concert, and there we were, watching a miniaturized Of Montreal — just Kevin Barnes solo, albeit with the assistance of singer Rebecca Cash and guitarist Bryan Poole for ""Feminine Effects"" — as it strummed its way through three stripped-down songs.

So if you're looking for another side of Barnes' music — for comparison, check out the April 2012 Of Montreal concert we recorded for NPR Music, the description of which includes the words ""wildly theatrical,"" ""flamboyant,"" ""synchronized dancing"" and ""strange, wandering creatures that look like amoebas"" — you'll get it here. The singer told us that he'd been working on quieter, more personal material in recent months, and figured the intimate surroundings would be an ideal setting to try it out. The result is a rarely heard side of a band and a frontman for whom theatricality has long been a means of expression rather than an end unto itself. --STEPHEN THOMPSON

0mzjL5147i4,Black Prairie: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"The charming roots-folk band Black Prairie got its start as an outlet for The Decemberists' Chris Funk and Nate Query, who wanted an outlet for some of their rootsy, mostly instrumental string-band wanderings. As the new group expanded to incorporate more members — including another wayward Decemberist, Jenny Conlee, on accordion — its sound has grown as well, with Annalisa Tornfelt's sweetly countrified vocals and violin lending Black Prairie's songs an added dimension.

As if to flesh out The Decemberists' more stripped-down Tiny Desk appearance from 2011 — only guitarist Chris Funk performed at both shows — Black Prairie played richly layered versions of three cuts from last year's A Tear in the Eye Is a Wound in the Heart. Like so much great folk music, there's a marvelous blend of darkness and light at work here, as the band lends a snappy, lilting quality to songs of alienation and darkness. --STEPHEN THOMPSON

8Pk_2dVPjms,Lucius: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"We brought Lucius to the Tiny Desk because I fell in love with one joyous, catchy song: ""Don't Just Sit There."" That's all I had to go on — I'd never seen the group live — and though I expected fun, we also got fabulous. Not only are Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig a winning singing duo, but their charisma and charm helps turn good pop songwriting into an endearing performance.

Both Berklee School of Music alumni, the two women moved to a Victorian home they'd found on Craigslist. As it turns out, that old Brooklyn home had a 60-year history as a recording studio and music school, complete with an old Steinway piano; it was there that they found their future bandmates. Danny Molad, Peter Lalish and Andrew Burri fill out the group with guitars and drums and an uncanny ability to create songs with vastly differing character.

One minute, Lucius sounds like a girl group circa 1961; the next, you could be hearing an Emmylou Harris outtake. And, though only four songs turn up on the band's 2012 EP, I feel a strong album on the way. Pair that with a dynamic and lovable stage presence, and what you're witnessing from Lucius at the Tiny Desk sounds like the early days of a long career. --BOB BOILEN

n7w0-KgZMdY,Miguel: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Miguel turned up in the NPR Music offices early one morning, after playing a show late the night before. He appeared light and calm, and betrayed no hint that he was nervous about stripping his highly produced hits down to their bones. Accompanied by just his guitarist, Dru DeCaro, Miguel eschewed flash and went big on small gestures — ingratiating ad libs, only one full spin and voice control that kept the songs close to his chest but emotive enough to translate to the back of the room. He told us he wrote his Grammy-nominated song ""Adorn"" with no idea that it would take him to our tiny stage. But he was made for it. His style was compact and graceful, his manner self-aware and open.

After releasing two albums, the 27-year-old performed as if he'd spent years of his life pressing rewind and pause on the great entertainers of our time — James Brown, Prince, Sam Cooke, Jackie Wilson, Michael Jackson. After he ended his set, I wanted to ask who'd taught him the most, but the crush of admirers loomed and I got out of the way of the cellphone cameras. He's a genuine, modern-day star. --FRANNIE KELLEY

6D5r_7UW8eA,The Polyphonic Spree: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"This year marks the 10th anniversary for The Polyphonic Spree's annual holiday music show — an extravaganza the group has held in Dallas each December — and it's celebrating with a live tour and a new CD called Holidaydream, on which the band reworks versions of classics such as ""Do You Hear What I Hear"" and ""White Christmas.""

Last week, The Polyphonic Spree's members rolled up to NPR in their packed-to-the-gills bus and unloaded a small army of horn players, singers and assorted gear for the largest Tiny Desk performance we've ever hosted. The band members spent much of the day getting ready for the three-song set, puzzling out the logistics of getting that many people behind Bob Boilen's desk. But, they said, it's a ""human Tetris game"" they've played many times before, and by the early afternoon they were ready to go.

While many of the large groups we host at the Tiny Desk often opt for stripped-down performances, what you see here with The Polyphonic Spree is pretty close to the band's full-on production, with a horn section, cellist, guitars and drums — and, of course, the full group of singers, led by the wonderfully effusive Tim DeLaughter.

For this special holiday Tiny Desk performance, The Polyphonic Spree treated the NPR Music office to two traditional carols — ""The Christmas Song"" and ""Silver Bells"" — and the more modern John Lennon classic ""Happy Xmas (War Is Over)."" --ROBIN HILTON

xKdp5uI8AC0,Alt-J: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"There's mystery in the music of Alt-J: The band's songs are wrapped in enigmatic textures, with swift shifts in arrangements inside every song and an oddness to the drums. Mere glimpses of lyrics are discernible, even after listening over and over — and if you can decipher the words, the meanings don't necessarily follow immediately. Still, those words reside at the core of Alt-J, and they're cinematic and stunning and sometimes brutal.

Seeing Alt-J live in concert — or here at the Tiny Desk — reveals a few of those mysteries, making a band that can be difficult on first listen a bit easier to digest. For one, seeing Joe Newman sing makes his words less oblique; for another, that curious rhythm at the foundation of the songs reveals not a hint of cymbals. And, though the drums are stripped down more than ever at the Tiny Desk, they still provide the essence of an original sound. Thom Green plays mostly with a mounted tambourine and cowbell for the sorts of things a hi-hat would accomplish — that tick tick sound, with the snap of the sound coming from a small-bodied 10"" snare called a popcorn snare. The sparseness that happens in the absence of crashing cymbals leaves a lot of space in the music.

Alt-J is from Leeds, England — home to another of my favorite art-rock bands, Gang of Four. Both play angular, poetic music that takes unexpected turns, shifting gears when you least expect it. Alt-J made my favorite album of 2012, An Awesome Wave, and if you're new to the group, the understated sound may get lost on you at first. But listen to the words and study how the songs evolve: No one else is making music like this. This is an original, innovative band with a brilliant present and a brighter future. --BOB BOILEN

LFs3XUqJvNg,Lyle Lovett: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"For all of Lyle Lovett's considerable artistic gifts — a distinctive voice, easygoing charisma, rare talent for wordplay — his greatest attribute may be the way he radiates infectious calm. He's a one-time tabloid fixture who writes wry, bittersweet songs of longing, but Lovett in person is like a vortex into which stress and drama disappear. That's especially true now that he's fulfilled his obligations to his longtime record label: Lovett not only showed up at NPR Music's offices without an entourage, but also booked his Tiny Desk Concert himself, emailing us out of the blue to express his interest. (Our reply: ""We would only agree to have you perform a Tiny Desk Concert if it's under any conceivable circumstance."")

So it's appropriate that Lovett would open this performance at the NPR Music offices by performing ""Cowboy Man,"" the first track on his 1986 debut: He may be a music-industry veteran, but in many ways, he's starting over. With a fresh-faced accompanist in fiddler and backup singer Luke Bulla, Lovett gives a loose, engaging performance that feels like both an introduction and a victory lap.

He follows ""Cowboy Man"" with two songs from 1989's Lyle Lovett and His Large Band, so this is no mere promotional appearance. With nothing in particular to promote — though he did put out an album of covers, Release Me, earlier in the year — Lovett seems motivated primarily by the sheer joy of playing his songs. His pleasure is infectious. --STEPHEN THOMPSON

LKvFhPF0xYA,Daniel Bachman: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"For an early-twentysomething, Daniel Bachman has roots buried deep. His approach to the American Primitive style of acoustic guitar — a sonically vivid fingerpicking technique developed by John Fahey and expanded by the likes of Robbie Basho and, later, Jack Rose and Glenn Jones — is conversational and uplifting, much like the man himself. After a rousing performance of ""Honeysuckle Reel"" from a forthcoming seven-inch single, however, Bachman turned beet-red in the NPR Music office and said, ""I'm not going to lie. I'm pretty nervous.""

Endearing as his admission is, once Bachman zeroes in on the center of a song, it's easy to get lost in it yourself. Strap on a pair of heavy boots and ""Honeysuckle Reel"" becomes an ecstatic dance tune or, at the very least, a foot-stomping good time. He closes with the reflective title track from one of two great albums he put out in 2012, Seven Pines, whose simple melody dives in and out of low-string chord crashes and tumultuous swirls of dizzying fingerpicking. --LARS GOTRICH

Robbed of a gift for melody and poetry, Mitchell would probably (and may yet) write some tremendous novels. Her ambitious recent discography bears out that notion: The 2010 album version of her star-packed folk opera Hadestown recasts Greek legend in America, while this year's Young Man in America turns her thoughts to the pitfalls of modern life, inspired in part by the works of Mitchell's writer father.

Thankfully, as this Tiny Desk Concert in the NPR Music offices demonstrates, Mitchell possesses a warm and ingratiating style to go with her evocative, impeccably crafted lyrics. Singing and playing alongside guitarist and longtime collaborator Michael Chorney, she performs three of Young Man in America's most bracingly beautiful songs with clear-eyed directness that requires no adornment. --STEPHEN THOMPSON

JrEJmvuKSwo,Macklemore & Ryan Lewis: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Tears and laughter in the span of about 15 minutes — that's what's so astonishing about these Macklemore & Ryan Lewis songs.

The first time I heard ""Same Love,"" it brought tears to the eyes of a roomful of people, myself included. The song is about equality, specifically gay rights, with an unambiguous message: ""It's human rights for everybody / There is no difference."" Then, in a flip of a backing-track beat, Macklemore (a.k.a. Ben Haggerty) sings about wearing a velour jumpsuit and some house slippers, ""grandpa style.""

The contrast in these songs, ""Same Love"" and ""Thrift Shop,"" makes the levity all that much memorable; as producer, Ryan Lewis is a master at the hook and clever with the melody. But this Tiny Desk Concert didn't end there: The live, sweet, soulful sounds of singer Ray Dalton belting, ""Like the ceiling can't hold us"" had Macklemore standing on my desk and shaking the dust off the ceiling tiles.

Victoria Bergsman sings almost as if she doesn't care — but that contrast to almost every other singer I know is what makes me hear her words, and grants me space to think about her emotions. It's almost as if she etches the lines of a song and leaves listeners to fill in the rest.

In 2009, Taken by Trees put out one of my favorite records of that decade, East of Eden. The album explored and was inspired by a visit to Pakistan, while her new Other Worlds was inspired by a journey to Hawaii. These songs seem to come from a place somewhere between a dream state and waking life: There's restraint to the way the players approach this music, almost as if they're trying not to wake the baby in the other room. There's charm to that. And, though Bergsman was under the weather when Taken by Trees performed at the Tiny Desk, it all works wonderfully. --BOB BOILEN

1h_biu6oRTY,Martha Wainwright: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"by STEPHEN THOMPSON

Martha Wainwright's songs examine uncomfortable moments and life experiences gone wrong, but as she acknowledges in between songs at this Tiny Desk Concert, she often has to fudge her own life story to make the details more unsettling. (""Take everything with a grain of salt,"" she says, ""except the good stuff."") What she does is the opposite of sugarcoating: She roughs up life's smooth spots, then digs her fingertips into the cracks that form.

Wainwright's new album, Come Home to Mama, addresses her place on the continuum between her late mother (singer Kate McGarrigle) and her young son — particularly in the wrenching and insightful ""Everything Wrong,"" a ballad Wainwright calls ""my first song about motherhood."" That song closes both Come Home to Mama and this concert in the NPR Music offices, and it's tremendous: raw and almost painfully intimate, wonderfully humane and ultimately hopeful.

Martha Wainwright is the second member of her family to play the Tiny Desk in the last few months, following in the footsteps of her brother Rufus. Their father, Loudon Wainwright III, released a marvelous record near the beginning of this year, so is completing the family trifecta too much to ask? Consider this an invitation.

wMj-Ai9NOjY,Ben Gibbard: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"by STEPHEN THOMPSON

Ben Gibbard has spent so much time at the head of various bands — Death Cab for Cutie, The Postal Service, All-Time Quarterback — that it's easy to forget how well his sweetly brainy songs work in a solo acoustic setting. His melodies are sturdy enough to withstand skeletal arrangements, and though his persona is unassuming by nature, he remains a charismatic and charming live performer.

Gibbard just released a solo album, Former Lives, which he's said is a repository for material that didn't work as Death Cab for Cutie songs; from that record, only ""Teardrop Windows"" pops up in his Tiny Desk Concert. For the rest, he draws from Death Cab's most recent album (""St. Peter's Cathedral,"" from Codes and Keys) and, of all places, last year's Arthur soundtrack (""When the Sun Goes Down on Your Street"").

In all, Gibbard's set makes a fine choice as the 250th Tiny Desk Concert we've published since the series was born nearly five years ago: For all the big, elaborate set-ups we've entertained in the NPR Music offices, it's always nice to return to the series' origins as a place for quiet singer-songwriters to do their thing unadorned, without getting drowned out by other sounds. Even minus a band at his back, Gibbard warrants the undivided attention.

gOMRNSmwa3U,Flaco Jimenez: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"by FELIX CONTRERAS

Watching Flaco Jimenez play his button accordion is like looking back in time. His grandfather started playing an accordion in cantinas and family parties along the Texas/Mexican border around the late 1800s. Then Flaco's dad, Santiago Jimenez Sr., carried on the family tradition when he released his first record in 1936.

Two of the songs you hear Flaco Jimenez play in this Tiny Desk Concert are traditional German polkas; they were popular in the mid-1800s as German immigrants settled in Texas before it became part of the U.S. almost 20 years later. Over time, the two-step stayed the same, but the German lyrics were replaced by the Mexican storytelling song form known as corridos.

But Jimenez is no dusty relic; he's very much of the here and now. For almost six decades, he's carried on those traditions and taken them to places neither his grandfather nor his father could ever imagine. He's played with The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Dr. John, Los Lobos, Willie Nelson and Ry Cooder; he's toured the world and won Grammys. He's become a symbol of ethnic pride among Mexican-Americans for not only preserving the conjunto sound, but also moving it forward.

Listen closely to this recording: I think the secret to Jimenez's longevity lies in the short bursts of improvisation in between verses he shares with bajo sexto player Max Baca, of the Grammy-winning band Los Texmaniacs. (The two have an album due out in the spring.) The notes seem to spin and strut just as the dancers do in the serious conjunto dance halls. There's a stutter here, a jazz-like riff there, and when he extends the notes and holds them playfully, I recall my own mother teaching me to spin her in a tight pirouette at family weddings and quinceñeras.

Jimenez was able to perform a Tiny Desk Concert because he had traveled to Washington, D.C., from his home in San Antonio to receive a Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment of the Arts. He was being honored for carrying on what his grandfather and so many other conjunto musicians have been doing for more than a century: getting people on the dance floor with an accordion and a song.

FZF13DJf13k,Jason Lytle: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"by ROBIN HILTON

Sometimes, it's hard to know what constitutes a band. Billy Corgan wrote and sang all the songs for The Smashing Pumkpins and still records under the name, even though the other original members are long gone. Same deal with James Mercer and The Shins. Jason Lytle, on the other hand, spent nearly 15 years leading Grandaddy, dissolved the group in 2006 and decided to continue as a solo artist, even though he wrote, sang and recorded Grandaddy's songs almost entirely on his own.

You've got to give the guy credit. Lytle could have slapped the higher-profile Grandaddy name on his beautiful, deeply moving 2009 album Yours Truly, The Commuter, and on his equally impressive record from this fall, Dept. of Disappearance, and few could have discerned the difference. But whatever. Lytle still makes some of the best music of his life.

So it's only fitting, and a rare treat, to see Jason Lytle go it alone in this Tiny Desk set, performing bare-essentials versions of songs he created and recorded at his home studio. He treated the NPR Music offices to two tracks from his current record, ""Willow Wand Willow Wand"" and ""Get Up and Go,"" as well as a super-cool (and tear-jerking) acoustic-guitar version of ""Jed the Humanoid,"" one of the most memorable songs he ever released as Grandaddy.",2012-11-05 19:46:47,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZF13DJf13k,NORMAL,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FZF13DJf13k/default.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FZF13DJf13k/mqdefault.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FZF13DJf13k/hqdefault.jpg,NPR Music,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A
Er4q34P5Pxs,Passion Pit: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"by STEPHEN THOMPSON

Passion Pit's Michael Angelakos is a fussy sonic craftsman: A keyboardist and singer who started out working solo on his laptop, he now makes fizzily catchy electro-pop that orbits around monster hooks. He's not, in other words, the first musician you'd associate with a stripped-down performance behind NPR Music's Tiny Desk, where Technicolor production tends to give way to unfiltered voices and bare instrumental essentials. But Angelakos, a gifted songwriter who's been publicly forthcoming and articulate about his battles with bipolar disorder and substance abuse, is no intellectual or musical lightweight.

Angelakos clearly saw an opportunity in bare-bones arrangements of his best-known songs — his 2008 breakthrough single ""Sleepyhead"" and two hits from this year's Gossamer, ""Take a Walk"" and ""Carried Away"" — that he couldn't explore with a full band. With only his own falsetto, an electric piano, and simple guitar lines from Passion Pit's Ian Hultquist, Angelakos gets to direct listeners toward his words, which blossom under scrutiny. ""Take a Walk,"" for example, turns up in a zillion commercials thanks to that monster hook, but it's also a rich, thoughtful sketch of an immigrant family's experiences, expectations, dreams and disappointments. In this performance, the hooks do persist, but words rule the day.

Lord Huron is a band for just about anyone: The rich harmonies are welcoming, the lyrics relatable and the live performances thrilling. The group started out as a solo project for singer Ben Schneider, but is now a full assortment of terrific musicians, all based in Los Angeles.

The band's first album, Lonesome Dreams, just came out — you might have seen the Western-style film that accompanied the first single, ""Time to Run,"" which Scheider describes as, ""A tragic tale of the foolish things a man might find himself doing for a woman, and the consequences that foolishness may bring upon him and those around him.""

Dig into this Tiny Desk Concert, and pay no mind to the fact that, like me, Schneider showed up in the office wearing a hat and bolo tie — and, like me, plays the same black Martin guitar. We aren't in any way related, just kindred spirits.

fEjzBKo-sxI,Robert Cray: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Bringing blues music to the Top 40 isn't easy: Only a handful of musicians have done it in the 30 years Robert Cray has spent winning awards, selling millions of records and otherwise kicking around on the national stage. But Cray has, crossing over from blues-club stages to arenas with the double-platinum 1986 album Strong Persuader and its single ""Smoking Gun,"" and has continued to stick around as one of the most reliably gifted and accessible guitarists around.

For all the attention Cray receives as an instrumentalist, it's his smooth, smoky voice that really sells his music. Equal parts soul man and blues belter, he presides over a crack band — bassist Richard Cousins, keyboardist Jim Pugh and drummer Tony Braunagel, who performs here by tapping a wooden box — at this Tiny Desk Concert in the NPR Music offices.

Like any great blues singer, Cray makes heartache and other romantic dysfunction sound engaging and relatable: Ironically, if not surprisingly, his saddest song here (yes, sadder than ""Sadder Days"") is the one called ""I'm Done Crying."" But all three of these tracks, culled from Cray's new album Nothin But Love, execute the deftest possible blend of emotional misery and instrumental majesty — just the way the blues ought to be.

But when the three musicians share a stage as Dirty Three — as they've done on and off for 20 years now — the result can be both beautiful and bonkers, as the opening moments of this Tiny Desk Concert amply demonstrate.

One of the loudest performances ever captured in the NPR Music offices — and it's got some competition from any number of brass bands — Dirty Three's set alternately seethes and rages in a flurry of high kicks, shambolic rumbling, prolific hairiness and dramatic yelling. Standing atop Bob Boilen's desk, Ellis cuts a stooped, lanky figure, but there's real physicality to his performance here, as he leads Dirty Three through three stormy songs: ""Rain Song"" and ""The Pier"" (from this year's Toward the Low Sun) and ""Last Horse on the Sand"" (from 1998's Ocean Songs).

The group makes music I'd call ""new old-timey,"" but which its members call ""open-door gospel"" — gospel music that's not tied to any particular religious denomination.

You'll hear fiddle, banjo, guitar and washboard, all gathered around a single microphone in an old-style tradition. An unsigned band living in Brooklyn, Spirit Family Reunion makes music filled with joy, perfect for a Tiny Desk Concert. Its members told Weekend Edition Sunday's David Greene that they've been traveling the country in a beat-up Chevy conversion van, sleeping on floors and wherever else they can lay their heads. The band recently self-released a new album, No Separation, and its songs translate perfectly into foot-stomping singalongs in the NPR Music offices.

IIlgjOCxhLQ,Antibalas: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"There just aren't many bands like Antibalas. These are jazz players making dance music: Their music is big and fun, and their guiding spirit is Fela Kuti, the brilliant big-band leader and Nigerian Afrobeat pioneer. Afrobeat is a musical style featuring nearly endless songs, mixing funk and jazz, grooves and riffs, with the rhythm carried by not only the drums, but everyone. Everyone — horn players, bass players, guitarists — plays rhythm in Afrobeat music.

Antibalas (Spanish for ""bulletproof"") is a Brooklyn ensemble, and 11 members turned up at the Tiny Desk. Many of these musicians may be familiar to listeners of Sharon Jones & The Dap Kings, The Roots, Paul Simon or Public Enemy. Most recently, Antibalas found some fame performing — and some of the members arranging and directing music — for the Tony-winning Broadway stage presentation of Fela!

It's one thing for a big group to make a big sound — and, sure, Antibalas does that — but what stands out is the subtlety of this ensemble; the way the horns weave in and out of each other, sometimes complementing and at other times inspiring and creating musical conversation between players. That extends to all the players, from vocals to guitar. When you start to listen to that conversation and you hear that build in a rhythm, it's so powerful, so full of joy. If they come to your town, drop what you're doing and go see them. Wear dancing shoes.

P19YL-fy3Vk,Yva Las Vegass: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"At NPR Music, we get stacks of CDs in the mail, as well as countless links to music streams, from bands trying to stand out and get some attention. It's safe to say that we all share similar previewing procedures: At some point, we just sit and listen.

What are we listening for? I can't speak for the others, but I'm constantly in search of music I haven't heard, but which sounds as if it's been in my life forever.

That's exactly what happened when I put on Yva Las Vegass' album, I was born in a place of sunshine and the smell of ripe mangoes. I was knocked out by the way she infuses Venezuelan folk traditions with a punk aesthetic. I heard songs as allegories, songs that told stories and songs that felt like deep primal screams, all accompanied by a traditional Venezuelan cuatro — a small stringed instrument similar to a ukulele.

At the NPR Music offices, Las Vegass weaves magic with her presence, her playing and especially her voice. You can't quite see her cut-off jeans and Chuck Taylor high-top sneakers behind Bob Boilen's desk, but in attitude and style, Yva Las Vegass is punk-rock through and through.

LRix5o2-fiU,Amanda Palmer And The Grand Theft Orchestra: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"A primal, turbulent and artful slice of pop, the new Amanda Palmer record has won my heart. Theatre Is Evil's first song is a wall of well-defined noise that, I'll admit, had me throwing my fist in the air when no one else was around. It was the same feeling I had hearing David Bowie's ""It's No Game"" from Scary Monsters more than 30 years ago.

With the highest money-raising musical Kickstarter project ever, Palmer — and her fabulous new band, The Grand Theft Orchestra, with producer John Congleton — captured lightning in a bottle. The result will do more than just energize the almost 25,000 fans who helped make it possible. To be honest, I've admired Palmer but was never in the class of dedicated followers, until now: Theatre Is Evil is genius, savvy pop filled with smart storytelling that won't let go.

So how does this monster sound translate to the Tiny Desk — without the strings, the horns, the big drums and studio alchemy? The answer turned out to be simple: As all good songs do when stripped naked, they worked perfectly. Palmer pulls off just the right proportion of being in your face without being didactic. There isn't the sort of vagueness I hear in so much pop prose; these songs' fervor is the product of a singer armed with intensity and musicians who can match it.

HnwQ4gOgnXA,Kat Edmonson: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"We first met Kat Edmonson nearly four years ago, when All Songs Considered put out a challenge to songwriters on the eve of Barack Obama's inauguration. We asked musicians around the country to capture the moment in song, and Edmonson, a native of Texas, wrote and sent us ""Be the Change."" It was clearly the best song we received, and she sang it with a unique voice and wonderful phrasing — so spot on. Later, we loved her cover of the George Gershwin-DuBose Heyward standard ""Summertime.""

Hearing Edmonson makes it virtually impossible to do anything but stop and listen. It was clear, hearing the 29-year-old interpret ""Summertime,"" that the era around the 1930s and '40s was a rich place for her voice.

These days, Edmonson writes some of her own songs, digging deep into the spirit of those more artistically innocent times, and she finds contemporary writers who tell tales of longing and desire and more. On her new album Way Down Low, and now at the Tiny Desk, Edmonson is no longer simply inspired by days gone by; with that fragile voice, she's given it new life. In a digital and branded age, she stands out soft and clear.

S19Q4e4Q4Kk,Avi Avital: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Other than bluegrass virtuosos like Ricky Skaggs, players of the mandolin don't often get taken very seriously. But a young Israeli musician named Avi Avital is trying to change that. He's not a bluegrass star; instead, his mandolin sings with the sounds of Johann Sebastian Bach, Ernest Bloch and contemporary composers like Avner Dorman.

Avital's recording of a mandolin concerto by Dorman gave the instrument a little boost in 2010, when Avital became the first mandolinist to be nominated for a Grammy in the Best Instrumental Soloist category. The concerto was an Avital commission: The mandolinist feels strongly about challenging today's composers ""to consider the mandolin as a virtuoso instrument, and use its great sonorities and the immense palette of colors and expressions it can produce."" You can hear a lot of those colorful sonorities in this Tiny Desk performance.

Avital also adheres to the old ""necessity is the mother of invention"" axiom. Since mandolin compositions aren't thick on the ground, he arranges pieces written for other instruments — especially the violin, as the two instruments share the same tuning — and makes them his own.

Such is the case with Avital's opening piece, ""Nigun."" Written by Ernest Bloch in 1923 for violin and piano, the music is a deep exploration, the composer says, of the Jewish soul. Avital's arrangement, like the original, pivots between the ecstatic and the introspective, rising in intensity (and pitch) until finally disappearing in a mist of quietly plucked notes.

Avital caps off the performance with ""Bucimis,"" a raucous Bulgarian folk tune in the odd meter of 15/16. ""It's almost 4/4, but not quite,"" he says. ""I can play it, but I can't dance it.""

How does one become a world-class, award-winning classical mandolinist? Avital says it all started as a kid, as he admired an older neighbor boy who took mandolin lessons. When the neighbor traded up to a newer, better instrument, ""somehow his old beginner's mandolin ended up in my hands."" Good thing it did.

Set List:
""Nigun"" (Ernest Bloch)
""Bucimis"" (Traditional Bulgarian Folk Tune)

2ZNKLUHeJtg,Renaud Garcia-Fons: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Double bassist Renaud Garcia-Fons was destined to create music that spans genres and borders: He was born in France to a family with roots in the Catalonia region of Spain, and he's fluent in French, Spanish and English. Classical, jazz and flamenco represent equal parts of his musical DNA, and his technique reflects the delicate arco stylings of concert halls, the deep groove of jazz and the raw vitality of flamenco.

This appearance behind Bob Boilen's desk captures more than just Garcia-Fons' masterful technique. His musical vision can be heard in the digital loops of rhythm and sound that he generates entirely from his upright bass. He thumps, strums and pokes as he mines the sonic possibilities of not just his bass, but also his imagination.

Garcia-Fons isn't always such a lone wolf; his collaborators include symphony orchestras, jazz groups and an amazing trio that practically defines the concept of world music. If you only knew him through one genre, you'd be surprised to discover these other sides to his skills.

For one fortunate group of NPR staffers, we had him all alone with just his bass and creativity.

xCmcvsCxfng,Rufus Wainwright: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"We'd never tried to squeeze a piano behind the Tiny Desk, but when I saw a chance to have Rufus Wainwright play here, I wouldn't — and he probably wouldn't — have had it any other way. Somehow, we managed to fit a glossy black Yamaha upright against my full bookshelves. Then we tuned it and waited for some glorious moments.

Wainwright was touring behind his new album, Out of the Game, and had scheduled a more formal appearance at Wolf Trap in Virginia that evening. Here, sporting a T-shirt and shorts, he performed three songs. By the middle of his closer, ""Montauk,"" few dry eyes remained among the NPR employees and guests.

""Montauk"" is Wainwright at his best. The piano lines flow with forward motion in a Philip Glass way, and there's also a hauntingly beautiful story. Wainwright sings to his daughter Viva, whom he raises with his husband and whose biological mother is Lorca Cohen. Cohen is Leonard Cohen's daughter; Wainwright is the son of Kate McGarrigle and Loudon Wainwright III. As if there weren't enough family ties already, the song imagines Viva grown up and visiting her two fathers in Montauk, a small community on the eastern tip of Long Island.

Wainwright plaintively sings:

One day you will come to Montauk

And you will see your dad wearing a kimono

And see your other dad pruning roses

Hope you won't turn around and go

""Montauk"" is the story of a modern family filled with old family worries, an emotional range familiar to the singer-songwriter.

""The Art Teacher""
""Respectable Dive""
""Montauk""

NrpX8HgQxOw,The Zombies: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Predicting music that will survive the ages just isn't possible. And the very existence of The Zombies in 2012 is even more baffling. Don't get me wrong; I love this group. A few of their 45 RPM singles — ""She's Not There"" and ""Tell Her No"" — I can still recall spinning 'round on my record player as a kid. But understand that this band didn't do so well at home in England and that its best known song, ""Time of the Season,"" came out after the band had already broken up. The fact that The Zombies were here at my desk, that the band put out a record of new songs — Breathe Out, Breathe In — that the full band just completed a U.S. tour and that they sounded fabulous (I saw them twice in the past six months) is beyond surreal, it's a marvel.

This stripped-down version of The Zombies features two founding members: Rod Argent, the very adept keyboard player and backing vocalist, and singer Colin Blunstone. It may be Blunstone's voice — that sultry, gentle, kicked-back style — that defined the band's sound. These days that voice packs more punch than it used to, which is odd and amazing for a 67-year-old singer, though it's still unmistakably him. We caught Blunstone early in the morning for this Tiny Desk Concert, a time of the day when his range was self-admittedly a bit strained. However, the essence is still all there and so is the chemistry between Colin and Rod, a chemistry that began 51 years ago.

hZ2lMzQf19U,Beth Orton: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"English singer-songwriter Beth Orton is one of the best-known practitioners of a subgenre in which folk songs are set to electronic beats — it's a sound she employed to popular and powerful effect throughout the late '90s and early '00s, on hit albums such as Trailer Park, Central Reservation and Daybreaker. But these days, Orton has been increasingly willing to sweep aside digital accoutrements and just sit on a stool with an acoustic guitar, as this Tiny Desk Concert in the NPR Music offices makes plenty clear.

Performing well in advance of her new album's release — the Tucker Martine-produced Sugaring Season, her sixth full-length, comes out Oct. 2 — Orton was fairly new to most of these songs herself. She said she'd only played the new ""Dawn Chorus"" a handful of times publicly before unveiling it at the Tiny Desk, while ""Candles"" and ""Poison Tree"" won't penetrate the public consciousness until weeks if not months from now. But she made sure to close her warm, charming set on a comfortingly familiar note — appropriate for a singer who brought cupcakes to share with the crowd — as she dug out a spare, lovely rendition of 1999's ""Sweetest Decline,"" from Central Reservation.

nHAPJaeacGE,The Walkmen: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"The Walkmen's wiry, weary, seething rock 'n' roll has mellowed in recent years, as vein-bulging hollers have given way to a richer, more gently paced and layered sound. But it's still not exactly the stuff of campfire crooning: We'd spent the days leading up to this Tiny Desk Concert in the NPR Music offices wondering how on earth The Walkmen would downsize these songs behind Bob Boilen's desk. For one thing, Hamilton Leithauser sings with such intensity that it'd be hard to dial down the instrumentation too much — you'd never hear it.
Leithauser may wield an acoustic guitar in these three songs, but this is no awkward attempt to shoehorn booming rock anthems into meek arrangements that don't suit them. From the opening notes of ""Heaven,"" the magnificently stirring title track of The Walkmen's recent seventh album, it became clear that these guys were making the Tiny Desk accommodate their sound rather than the other way around. Leithauser's voice soared far down the hallways at various points in all three of these songs from Heaven — ""Remember, rememmmmmmmber, all we fight for!"" ""It's been soooooooooooooo long!"" ""Love is luuuuuuuuuuuuuck!"" — lending them grit and grace, not to mention hair-raising intensity that feels a little jarring coming from a bunch of guys in crisp button-up shirts.

Set List:
 • ""Heaven""
 • ""We Can't Be Beat""
 • ""Love Is Luck""

Bailey doesn't play just any old cello. Yes, it is old — very old — but it's also special, built by the renowned Venetian maker Matteo Goffriller in 1693.

bWrVuKWs5Nw,Brooklyn Rider: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"It's hard to know what will happen when the string quartet Brooklyn Rider starts playing. Yes, these four guys love to play Debussy and Brahms, but they're just as likely to team up with a singer-songwriter or a Kurdish kamancheh player. Or write their own music.

So we weren't sure what they'd do when they stopped by Bob Boilen's desk to play a Tiny Desk Concert in the NPR Music offices. What we got was a bracing sample of their visceral fire, beginning with a saucy Armenian dance by an orthodox priest named Komitas — one of the pieces they picked up during their travels with Yo-Yo Ma's Silk Road Ensemble.

The next piece is proof that inspiration can come from almost anywhere — even, as Brooklyn Rider violinist Colin Jacobsen sheepishly admits, a ""bouncy-ball"" with a wildly unpredictable second bounce. He wrote the piece as a companion to music by Debussy. And finally, the piece we were anxiously anticipating: Brooklyn Rider's theme song of sorts, ""Ascending Bird."" It's Jacobsen's stunning arrangement of a Persian folk song that goes back thousands of years.",2022-10-24 15:36:43,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWrVuKWs5Nw,NORMAL,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bWrVuKWs5Nw/default.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bWrVuKWs5Nw/mqdefault.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bWrVuKWs5Nw/hqdefault.jpg,NPR Music,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A
0SNhAKyXtC8,Edmar Castaneda: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Edmar Castaneda is the sort of musician who isn't afraid to challenge the established order. He's carving out a place for himself in Latin jazz on an instrument you don't often hear in his chosen genre: the Colombian harp. He's adapted intricate traditional fingerpicking techniques to play jazz melodies along with the Afro-Cuban tumbao (bass line). As you can see and hear for yourself in this Tiny Desk Concert, he can switch between rural Colombian dance music and jazz with a twist of his wrist. Literally.

His musical vision is so invigorating that he's gaining fans like NEA Jazz Master Paquito D'Rivera, with whom Castaneda has performed. His Web site shows him constantly on the road as a guest artist with other forward thinkers, or with his latest touring trio, which consists of Castaneda, a drummer and a trombonist.

Castaneda recently parked himself behind Bob Boilen's desk and crafted a transporting mix of tradition and improvisation.

With the help of a crack backing band, his three-song set — all drawing from this spring's marvelous Troubadour, proves what we've been saying for months, K'naan has the makings of a global superstar who's as inspiring as his songs are infectious.

wKd0HNg1kFQ,Rodrigo y Gabriela: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"I can't think of a better way to describe the music of Rodrigo y Gabriela than with three words: ""heavy metal flamenco."" And yet the duo doesn't play heavy metal — its members perform instrumentals on nylon-string guitars — nor does it play Spanish dance music. But the term fits because the pair's fierce guitar riffs feel powerfully electric, and because Rodrigo y Gabriela's rhythmic style showcases a frenetic strum that conjures the energy of flamenco.

The duo have just released a new album titled, 11:11, which pays tribute to the pair's heroes — Jimi Hendrix, Carlos Santana, Astor Piazzolla and Pantera's Dimebag Darrell.

But when Dr. Ralph Stanley strolled in to give this Tiny Desk Concert, the office fell silent with the kind of reverence appropriate for a living legend.

But her self-titled, self-released 2006 album marked her as a fully formed talent — a warm and inviting singer whose songs convey world-weariness and homespun grace. Cahoone stopped by the NPR offices to perform a few songs at the desk of All Songs Considered host Bob Boilen.

sPZc74_1IiM,Jim White: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Jim White is a storyteller first and a musician second. It's a kind of storytelling rooted in his own unusual history: He grew up in Florida in a deeply Pentecostal community and fell in love with the white gospel music he heard. But from there, White took a surprising path to becoming a full-time musician. He was a professional surfer, a boxer, a fashion model in Milan and a cab driver in New York City. White's travels recently took him to Washington, D.C., where he stopped by the offices of NPR Music for this live performance.

The band's music can be pretty chaotic — loud and rumbling, with multiple instruments fighting to be heard. And singer Toby Leaman likes to belt out his vocals in a window-rattling, raspy growl.

118zckalkJ0,Tom Jones: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Sir Tom Jones, a full-throated legend among legends, wasn't an obvious choice for a Tiny Desk concert. When we began the series last year, the goal was to bring in quieter, more intimate artists (Laura Gibson, Vic Chesnutt) who are often drowned out by the clinking glasses and chatter of the small clubs they play. When a publicist for Tom Jones contacted us and said the singer wanted to do a ""Big Desk Concert"" for us, the thought of Jones' substantial voice filling our office left us laughing — and dying to do it.

jFUhTmOSdGQ,Milton Nascimento & esperanza spalding: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"Suraya Mohamed | August 7, 2024
We almost never post Tiny Desk (home) concerts anymore. But to have the glorious Brazilian musical icon Milton Nascimento with his gifted friend and collaborator, esperanza spalding, be an exception is perhaps the opportunity of a lifetime. Nascimento is 81 years old now and has difficulty traveling out of Brazil.

It’s hard to explain the gravity of Nascimento’s career and his significant influence on all genres of music. Performing for more than 60 years, the singer, musician and songwriter’s discography includes more than 40 albums. In his prime, his rich voice spanned many octaves. While his vocal quality might not be as strong now, there is an intangible essence that fills the void. “What’s so amazing is the quantum resonance of this elder’s life and you can’t make that sound,” spalding told WRTI’s Nate Chinen last month. “It’s not a sound, it’s a lived thing that does travel on the frequencies, obviously, but we don’t even have the words to describe what we’re actually picking up.”

In 2022, Nascimento was on his farewell tour, but in 2023 he put his retirement on hold after deciding to collaborate with spalding on their upcoming album, Milton + esperanza. Songs from that record are featured in this magical (home) concert. Recorded last month in Nascimento’s living room in Rio de Janeiro, it’s likely to be the only video performance of this music.

The songs here are gentle, lush and filled with passion. The beautiful harmonies and syncopated rhythms combine with spalding’s acrobatic bass lines to give the music a playful, dance-like feel. But what really stands out in this performance is the deep friendship, admiration and love Nascimento and spalding hold for one another.

YA6D6WmclMc,Jay Park: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"Sheldon Pearce | May 26, 2023
NPR Music's Tiny Desk is celebrating Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. These artists represent just a sliver of the cultural diversity that exists within the Asian American and Pacific Islander community.

As sunlight filters into the corner of the room, the singer and rapper Jay Park is turning his Everything You Wanted deep cut ""I Got This"" inside out with a groovy, lounge-ready interpretation on the trap-powered jam. ""Born and raised in Seattle; we rep South Korea — Seoul city,"" he outlines, before transitioning into the feel-good R&B of his 2022 single ""Need to Know,"" and that cross-cultural exchange has defined his keen shapeshifting — and the subtle breadth of the music he brings to his Tiny Desk (home) concert.

Since his days as a short-lived member of the K-pop group 2PM, Park has stayed at the forefront of the South Korean hip-hop and R&B scenes. As a performer, he has steadily evolved into a polymath, with a smooth, singsong style that straddles his rap and neo soul identities. He has since crossed over, signing with Roc Nation stateside, recording an EP with Hit-Boy and collaborating with artists ranging from Jay Electronica to Charli XCX.

His Tiny Desk (home) set plays into his natural instincts to mess around with many influences. Backed by a band and a small chorus that fill out his songs and let them breathe, Park brings a new warmth to his recent catalog here. He performs ""Yesterday"" and ""Ganadara,"" some of his more acoustic ballads, with even greater delicacy, the latter unwrapping gently into the more upbeat ""Candy."" This rendition of ""All I Wanna Do"" turns the hit into something funkier, amped by bass and harmonized vocal runs. And an ""only-for-NPR"" performance of ""Sex Trip"" strips the song down with raw, falsetto vocals. But everything Park's done, everything he is, is on display in the reimagined ""Mommae,"" in which a ratchet-era twerk anthem becomes soul balladry.

TcGJtLNZxYE,The Bad Ends: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"Robin Hilton | March 24, 2023
On one hand, this Tiny Desk (home) performance by The Bad Ends is an Athens, GA insider's dream, not just because the group features R.E.M. drummer Bill Berry and singer Mike Mantione of the band Five Eight, but because of all the Easter eggs the group placed around the room. There's the cookbook for the much-beloved restaurant The Grit, Jason Thrasher's Athens Potluck — a collection of photos and reflections from local musicians — and paintings by Athens artists like Terry Rowlett, Jill Carnes and even one by Neutral Milk Hotel's Jeff Mangum.

But this four-song set should feel magical to anyone who loves the loose intimacy you get when a group of friends play in their parents' basement, jamming together while dreaming that it's really for a stadium-sized rock show. The Bad Ends members, all longtime veterans, capture the spirit of their earliest days when anything seemed possible.

The songs they perform here are from the band's debut album, The Power And The Glory, including the closer, a wistful instrumental called ""Ode to Jose,"" which features Bill Berry on acoustic guitar. This is the first band Berry has been a member of — and the first album he's made — since leaving R.E.M. in 1997. Watching him play, lost deep in his thoughts, it's a moment that says, ""We've been on this road a long time, but the journey isn't over.""

CKg3FV5gwMc,RM of BTS: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"Stephen Thompson | December 2, 2022

Now that we’re back to recording Tiny Desk concerts in the office, home concerts mostly happen under special circumstances: when the artist is overseas, for example, or otherwise unable to get to Washington, D.C., when we’re recording. Given that BTS’s RM (aka Kim Nam-joon) is based in South Korea, we let it slide — not least because his team put together one of the most impressive Tiny Desk facsimiles we’ve seen yet. What really sets it apart is the huge array of shelf-bound ephemera, which is bound to have the BTS Army sleuthing in the YouTube comments. What’s a random tchotchke and what’s an Easter egg? Study the set closely!

RM timed his solo Tiny Desk debut — which follows BTS’s home concert from back in 2020 — to coincide with the release of his first official studio album, Indigo. But he kicks off the set with an older track, “seoul,” which first appeared on his 2018 mixtape mono. From there, he showcases the first two tracks from Indigo: the rap-driven “Yun” and the funky “Still Life,” both of which are inspired by RM’s love of and fascination with painting. The studio tracks feature Erykah Badu and Anderson .Paak, respectively, both of whom get shoutouts in this set. But here, the focus never drifts away from the star at center stage — no matter how closely you might squint at the stuffed animals, housewares, clocks and toys (not to mention Big Mouth Billy Bass!) behind him.

Now, if we can just get him to visit the real Tiny Desk…

RfkXW0Gm3eQ,Horace Andy: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"Bob Boilen | November 18, 2022
Today, right here, we get to peek into the decked-out living room of producer Adrian Sherwood's home and watch masters of reggae playfully chill. We hear Horace Andy's gruff tenor tell stories with 55 years of experience, rasp and wear.

""You've got to live, live, live for today, for tomorrow might never come your way,"" he pleads as he sings ""Today Is Right Here,"" a track on his 2022 album Midnight Rocker. And then the lines I love best, ""My mama told me when I was a child, said all the best things take a little while. But mama was wrong, wrong, wrong, the best things in life come and they go in the blink of an eye."" All the while, a single snare drum and hi-hat keep the beat, and the band of bass, guitar, keyboard, sax, trumpet and cello warmly support the emotions pouring from Horace Andy.

Sitting on the right side of the screen is Adrian Sherwood, the hugely influential dub producer, banging out stuttered rhythms and textures. Adrian Sherwood produced Midnight Rocker, and six months later its younger, dubbed-out sibling, Midnight Scorchers. Seeing all these pioneers pouring out these chill vibes for this Tiny Desk (home) concert is a total thrill.

2C-WmZQABLQ,Trueno: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Latinx Heritage Month with an ""El Tiny"" takeover, featuring Jessie Reyez, Susana Baca and more musicians from all corners of Latinidad.

Vita Dadoo | September 27, 2022

With his roots in La Boca neighborhood of Buenos Aires and arms outstretched to the rest of the world, Trueno is rewriting the playbook for Latin American hip-hop. Wearing a cap for the soccer team Boca Juniors and moving among the spaces of his childhood, the 20-year-old, premier Argentinian freestyler shows us exactly where he's from in his Tiny Desk (home) concert, an intimate performance that plays like a meditation on the music and the Argentina that has shaped him.

Trueno's almost autobiographical set begins with ""DANCE CRIP,"" the first single from his recent album, BIEN O MAL, and an ode to The Sugarhill Gang's 1979 hit ""Rapper's Delight."" Trueno's affinity for old school hip-hop is something the rapper returns to throughout his set, while also invoking percussion-forward beats and tango motifs. Trueno follows up with the album's title track, before launching into an improvised freestyle. Underneath a mural that reads ""La Boca resiste y propone"" (""La Boca resists and proposes""), Trueno demonstrates his lyrical dexterity and emotional range, ""Esto no lo puede hacer cualquiera, el vocero del ghetto conquistando la esfera,"" he raps, touting his neighborhood's resilience and his own.

Argentina as a place of celebration and lament is the thematic center of Trueno's performance. The show takes place at a conventillo, one of many Argentinian boarding houses and microcosms of multicultural communities. Trueno concludes his set with ""TIERRA ZANTA,"" perhaps the most politically charged song in his album, which on record features the famous folk artist Victor Heredia. Here, Trueno calls out all the Andean nations by name, hinting at a larger global movement behind the song's boundaries.

ug25yQSEub0,Carin León: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Latinx Heritage Month with an ""El Tiny"" takeover, featuring Jessie Reyez, Susana Baca and more musicians from all corners of Latinidad.

Felix Contreras | September 19, 2022
Having played the music myself, I have always lovingly referred to Mexican Regional music as “cowboy hats and accordions.” But this is not your grandparents’ Mexican Regional. Younger musicians today are rejecting the restrictions of that industry-imposed title and adding contemporary sounds like hip-hop and trap while still maintaining the emotional spirit and rough edges of the genre.

Then there’s Carin León — a game changer if there was one. His Tiny Desk (home) concert is a deep dive into this moment in time as the genre actually changes. He starts with a traditional bolero “El Amor De Tu Vida” but the second song, “Alguien Mejor,” is an example of how he and his amazing group are changing things. It starts with a traditional bajo sexto guitar as he raps and sings the lyrics, but when the mournful strains of a pedal steel guitar popular with trad country music enters the arrangement, the cross cultural reality of life along the border where this music comes from springs to life with the passion of both genres and cultures.

It’s an exciting moment from a four song performance that beautifully represents how a culture changes and develops as outside influences become part of its aesthetic. The music’s rustic roots are on display in the barroom set, complete with strategically placed bleached-out cattle skulls. You still see accordions and cowboy hats in this video but you hear so much more — you can actually hear a society in transition.

0VvdSqp69Lc,SFJAZZ Collective: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"Suraya Mohamed | August 10, 2022
How exciting to see so many all-star jazz greats performing together. The SFJAZZ Collective is a talented cohort of artists who perform arrangements of works by modern composers and also newly commissioned pieces by each member of the band.

In 2020, the Collective was scheduled to perform an in-person Tiny Desk concert, but it was canceled due to the pandemic. We are still working to make that happen — but in the meantime, let’s enjoy this uplifting Tiny Desk (home) concert, recorded in The Joe Henderson Lab at SFJAZZ, a large, sunny venue that serves as both a live performance space and as the Collective’s rehearsal space.
 
Earlier this year, the ensemble released New Works Reflecting the Moment (Live from the SFJAZZ Center 2021), an album addressing racial injustices, the ongoing pandemic and political polarization. In this concert, the musicians perform three songs from that project. “Ay Bendito” was written by tenor saxophonist David Sánchez, and its title is slang for “oh my God'' or “aw man”; it’s also subtitled “The Struggle Continues.”
 
Written to reflect the present moment, especially the isolation and social upheaval many of us continue to endure, “Mutuality” by tenor saxophonist Chris Potter was inspired by a Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. quote that reads, “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly.” 
 
Vocalist Gretchen Parlato’s “All There Inside '' was written with fellow SFJAZZ Collective vocalist Martin Luther McCoy in mind. Their voices fit together beautifully, and both the warm harmonies and the charming melody are the perfect foundation for Parlato’s inspiring message of hope and positive change: “Because it’s all there inside, all there inside of you.”

TCsFgJsJ5Uc,Big Thief: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"Bob Boilen | July 20, 2022
I love seeing friends playing comfortably at home, especially when those friends are members of my favorite band. What we see in this Tiny Desk (home) concert is playfulness substituting for the intensity that I normally find in Big Thief on a big stage. This band has made many of my best-loved albums in the past few years, beginning with its 2016 debut Masterpiece and including its 2022 double-album Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in You. The first three songs in this set all come from that album and were written by singer Adrianne Lenker, with ""Certainty"" co-written with guitarist Buck Meek.

Big Thief songs are often filled with tender tales and poetic and playful words. I can say the same for Adrianne Lenker's many solo albums and for Buck Meek's 2021 solo album, Two Saviors. Drummer James Krivchenia produced Big Thief's recent album and also a 2020 ambient album of his own, A New Found Relaxation. Max Oleartchik plays upright bass for this intimate acoustic set on the top floor of a house in ""windy Connecticut.""

There's a bit of a ""hold on to your hat"" feel here, with players watching each other for a possible surprise. Maybe it's James Krivchenia's banjo percussion, the galloping rhythm on ""Certainty"" or how the four musicians sing aloud on a chorus; it is so much fun to see it all unfold. The final song was the biggest surprise; it's an unreleased song Big Thief has been performing, appropriately called ""Happiness.""

Wl9j4OP9DKc,Curse Of Lono: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"Bob Boilen | July 14, 2022
The resonant voice of Felix Bechtolsheimer has me obsessed with his band Curse of Lono. For the group's Tiny Desk (home) concert, the six musicians set up shop in the office at Bechtolsheimer's house above his home studio in South London. They begin their set as they do their evocative 2022 album, People In Cars, with the song ""Let Your Love Rain Down On Me."" Bechtolsheimer's baritone is set against the dreamy wail of the pedal steel as he sings, ""I'm gonna make my move, hear the engine roar / Roll the windows down, slam my foot to the floor / Now I'm driving hard in this big machine / When they kill the pain, we'll all get clean."" All that angst leads to the chorus which, for me, offers one of the few glimmers of hope: ""Let your love rain down on me."" This isn't hope-filled, uplifting music; these are dark songs written following the losses of Felix's father, uncle and former girlfriend. That former partner is the subject of the final spine-chilling song. ""So Damned Beautiful"" tells the tale of her drug-filled weekend affair that ends in tragedy. It's the first duet Felix Bechtolsheimer has written; originally recorded with Tess Parks, it's sung here with Bo Lucas of the Brighton duo Lucas & King. The fragile characters and cinematic storytelling make their impact thanks to a band that knows how to delicately weave its sound and pulsing textures with an underpinning of drama and plenty of open space that leaves me mesmerized.

JvIllmsp1J4,Animal Collective: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"Bob Boilen | July 12, 2022
Every time I've witnessed Animal Collective in concert the band has been bathed in colored light, with shapes and patterns floating above the members' heads, often mirroring the unpredictable and mesmerizing journey that defines its music. Yet here, the band is brightly lit for its Tiny Desk (home) concert — which it filmed at MASS MoCA (Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art), playing new songs from its 11th studio album Time Skiffs — and the band's musical journey remains transfixing.

The four members known by their monikers Deakin, Panda Bear, Avey Tare and Geologist are joined by a silent ""time skiff rider,"" dressed mysteriously in a hooded robe, who cuts paper shapes at a tiny desk as the band's music unfolds.

The set begins as Animal Collective's new album opens, with ""Dragon Slayer"" morphing into ""Car Keys."" The abstract words ping back and forth between Deakin, Panda Bear and Avey Tare, resembling a secret code to which only they hold the key: ""I saw a red kite fly / Was it held by an anchor? / I saw a red kite burn / I saw a string gone astray.""

The final track ""Kings Walk"" is for those truly dedicated to the collective. It's an unreleased, vocal-heavy song that Animal Collective has been performing since 2019. With lyrics as abstract as Mary Lum's Assembly (Lorem Ipsum), the artwork filling the MASS MoCA walls behind the band, the music feels challenging, not always welcoming. It's a path in music that perhaps you've never taken, but may want to take again once you do.

PwV1-wZzT1Y,FKJ: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"Nisha Venkat | July 7, 2022
Watching FKJ build a song is like watching him play a game of musical tetris. One second he's coaxing a rasping rhythm out of a drum set — the next, he's clambering over instruments to get to the mic before the beat kicks in.

The process might make you want to tape your eyes open. This is not Live Production 101, and FKJ (short for French Kiwi Juice, the stage name of Vincent Fenton) is not here to explain his genius. The French producer and multi-instrumentalist is perhaps best known for his assist on Masego's sultry, rollicking ""Tadow,"" but there's only remnants of that energy here. This is new jazz: a synthy spectacle that's a treat for the ears and the eyes.

You get the sense – and Fenton confirms it – that he could spend all day tinkering in his studio. There's an ease to his motions when he grabs his guitar adding wah-wah sounds to his bassline on ""IHM,"" and something very relatable about how even the cameraman struggles to keep up with his motions, sending Fenton in and out of focus.

Sometimes, he grimaces (with effort or with ecstasy, who knows) when he plucks a string just right. And you might be similarly moved. This has all the shivers of ASMR with all the emotive joy of a warehouse electronic fête. Maybe you'll even feel what I did when the music ended — a silence so large, so full, you'll want to tear down the screen and dance in the jungle with him.

QR7_RDHan3M,Maylee Todd: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"Bob Boilen | July 6, 2022
Maylee Todd’s (home) concert is filled with electronics, a window into a virtual world, and the first digital avatar to ever perform a Tiny Desk concert. Maylee introduces us to her avatar Maloo, and the songs presented here from Maylee Todd’s debut album Maloo are sung from the avatar's perspective.

Written during the pandemic, the album is about mental health and filled with multiple science fiction stories, including one about a programmable planet depicted in the “window’” above Maylee Todd’s head. 

The electronic sounds that help tell these sci-fi tales include Maylee’s Tenori-on, a Yamaha instrument comprised of a panel of lights that, when touched, create patterns of sound. An iPhone pointing at Maylee’s face captures her reactions and expressions, which are then reflected in her avatar. Her musical partner Kyvita (Kyle Tan) accompanies her, adding textures from his synthesizers. 

In the song “Dream With You” Maylee explains that as the avatar is living its life, it realizes, “my brain, it’s doing things that I don’t want it to do.”  Maylee Todd explains that Maloo, “wrote a song, a breakup song saying bye bye to certain aspects that aren’t serving it anymore.”

Before her final song “Absolute Time and Space,” Maylee Todd makes a passionate plea: “Hold the ones you love dear to your heart, will ya! Cause time is passing by — we do not have absolute time and space — as it turns out — in these bodies.”

de3nUQIQIYY,J'Nai Bridges: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"This year, NPR Music is celebrating Black Music Month with an array of brand new Tiny Desk concerts — both from home and from behind our beloved Desk. Together, these artists represent the past, present and future of Black music. This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk's unique way of showcasing that talent.

Suraya Mohamed | June 27, 2022
Mezzo-soprano J'Nai Bridges is a rising star who recently won a Grammy Award and other accolades too long to list here. We're glad she accepted our invitation to record this Tiny Desk (home) concert, which features Damien Sneed on piano, Nolan Nwachukwu on bass and Christian Xavier McClendon McGhee on drums. She opens with ""Habanera"" from Carmen by Georges Bizet, a character she calls ""one of the strongest women in all of opera."" She also performs ""Prayer"" by Carlos Simon, a close collaborator, and ""Heaven"" by Duke Ellington, before closing out her set with the hymn ""His Eye Is on the Sparrow.""

In a message to the Tiny Desk team, she wrote: ""I remember NPR's Tiny Desk series premiering and thinking how refreshingly authentic and intimate these performances were. I often had dreams of performing here, but admittedly, I didn't think it was possible for opera singers to effectively express themselves in this way. I was wrong.""

Bridges loves to sing opera but has also discovered that she holds many different voices within herself, which comes across in her wide-ranging set. ""When I meet people and tell them I'm an opera singer, it's almost always met with surprise, enthusiasm, and curiosity about what led me to this career,"" she writes. ""My upbringing — singing in the church — helped me discover other aspects of my voice, and then when I was exposed to opera it immediately opened a world of possibility. The voice is not limited to skin color, but it took me seeing someone who looked like me to realize that I too can sing opera.""

jJ2rPTG1G9U,Monica: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"This year, NPR Music is celebrating Black Music Month with an array of brand new Tiny Desk concerts — both from home and from behind our beloved Desk. Together, these artists represent the past, present and future of Black music. This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk's unique way of showcasing that talent.

Mitra I. Arthur | June 24, 2022
It's only right to think ""New Monica!"" when her Tiny Desk (home) concert begins. Surrounded by candlelight, dressed in pink, Monica stands ready to deliver a vibrant vocal masterclass.

With her rich alto, Monica broke onto the music landscape in 1995 with her debut album, Miss Thang. In her class of '90s artists, the singer brought a mature sound, yet still tempered by youth, that made her relatable to audiences of any age who were growing into their own. Monica's albums are grounded in the here and now, the ups and the downs of life and love. For fans, she feels like a longtime friend to root for, not only for her talent, but because her realness is valued — an energy she brings to this performance.

Here Monica and her musicians strip down 2003's ""So Gone,"" allowing a mellow, acoustic guitar to shine alongside the vocals. She shows us that when it comes to any #SoGoneChallenges, the viral challenge that had artists putting their own spin on the song, her original still reigns supreme. She also gives us a teaser of her upcoming single, the collaboration with Ty Dolla $ign ""Friends,"" on which Monica presents a tale of a relationship that doesn't require understanding from anyone on the outside, her soaring and acrobatic voice bending over a declaration of love. And when Monica revisits singles from her debut album, ""Why I Love You So Much"" and ""Before You Walk Out of My Life,"" in her Tiny Desk (home) concert they resonate on a different, and perhaps deeper, level now.

F8SjbnDxCy8,Larry June: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"This year, NPR Music is celebrating Black Music Month with an array of brand new Tiny Desk concerts — both from home and from behind our beloved Desk. Together, these artists represent the past, present and future of Black music. This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk's unique way of showcasing that talent.

Bobby Carter | June 16, 2022
Larry June is the indie-rap hustle personified. His graduation from the streets has made way for his true purpose in rhyme: healthy living. The organic fruits and juices on the table in this performance indicate the lifestyle fervently pushed in his music. The two cell phones sitting beside him remind us that business is booming. He starts with a few signature adlibs before imploring, ""Don't check me / Check the air quality."" This lavish living room setting, with the Los Angeles night sky as a backdrop, sets the proper mood for Larry June's Tiny Desk (home) concert.

The Bay Area emcee has been at this for a while, adopting the independent approach like many before him: saturating the market with product and profiting from shows and merch. While much of the music industry stumbled and stalled during the uncertainty of 2020, Larry put up numbers, releasing half a dozen projects from his home studio. Here, he's able to comfortably sit back in the laid-back tone we're used to hearing on his records and not the dialed-up mood of his stage show. His band, The NME, replays and beefs up the sample on 2020's ""Just me & you,"" plus songs from 2019's Out The Trunk and Early Bird.

In theory, a motivational rapper rapping about bike rides, hikes and investments would be deemed shtick in 2022 — yet he's here, authentic and refreshing. Good job, Larry.

NNodeNnXWy0,FKA twigs: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"This year, NPR Music is celebrating Black Music Month with an array of brand new Tiny Desk concerts — both from home and from behind our beloved Desk. Together, these artists represent the past, present and future of Black music. This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk's unique way of showcasing that talent.

LaTesha Harris | June 10, 2022
To see her is to appreciate a rare portrait. To watch her dance and hear her sing is to fall, entranced, into an uncanny haze. Both snake and its charmer, British Jamaican multidisciplinary artist FKA twigs is a new-age priestess. Surrounded by flames of offering in the hallowed halls of London's St. Matthias Church, the Grammy-nominated artist and her three-piece supporting band deliver a sermon on the perils of devotion. In her three-song Tiny Desk (home) concert -- featuring soul-baring ballads like “home with you” and “cellophane” -- she honors the strength of vulnerability; her operatic soprano ignites and delivers catharsis. 

After working as a backup dancer with hopes of transitioning to singing, FKA twigs released two EPs before achieving widespread critical acclaim with her debut studio album, 2014’s LP1, and its lead single, “Two Weeks.” A classically trained singer, FKA twigs makes music that blends deceptively demure vocals with otherworldly trip-hop beats. She perfected this signature avant-garde sound on her sophomore album, 2019’s MAGDALENE, establishing herself as a direct musical descendent of iconic innovators like Kate Bush and Janet Jackson. Fresh off the success of her recent mixtape, CAPRISONGS, FKA Twigs blesses viewers with a performance of her latest song, “killer.”

This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk's unique way of showcasing that talent.

Suraya Mohamad | June 8, 2022
British-Nigerian pop star Naira Marley opens his set with a sly smile and softly says “Marlians,” the name for his stans, a loyal group of followers who call Marley their president. Then, the first song kicks right in with a bouncy dance beat that just might get you dancing, wherever you are. 

It’s OK that you might not know what Marley is actually speaking about. His casual rapping style, defined by lexical tones in the Yoruba language, is enough. The first song, “Ayewada,” means “where is the time and space” and has an English language line: “They are calling you thief / You are dancing wit de goat.” 

Marley is one of the greatest and most celebrated artists performing and producing in the Afrobeat scene today. He just released his debut album, God’s Timing’s the Best, on his own label. All songs performed here are from that new record, except the third song, “Soapy, '' which is a hit single from 2019. 

His Marlian Records label has been producing and developing many rising Afropop stars, including Zinoleesky, a singer, songwriter and performer who performs on his own and is featured here on the last two songs of this set. Keep an eye out for him as he is sure to be another big name in the Afrobeat world.

Nikki Birch | June 3, 2022
A smile, laughter and a candle burning beside a delicate flower arrangement welcome us into the warm studio that is the set of James Francies’ Tiny Desk (home) concert. The young Houstonian and Blue Note recording artist begins with the hypnotic grooves of “713” — one of our picks for the best songs of 2021. This tune allows Francies’ virtuosic playing to shine, as he masterfully scales the keys during his solo. After a quick greeting, we’re whisked away by the luscious string ensemble that introduces “Rose Water.” Performed by vocalist Elliott Skinner, we’re lifted by Skinner’s voice as he sings beautifully of hope, support and growth: “I wish that you could see the light / That radiates in everyday…All the trials inside my mind / Shape me.” 

Francies ends his set with “Sway/Freedmen’s Town.” The jazz trio plays while a recording of the voice of Francies’ father, James Francies Sr., tells the story of Freedmen’s Town, a historic district of Houston now known as Fourth Ward. It’s a fitting end to a Tiny Desk (home) concert that celebrates Black Music Month, a poignant and powerful reminder of how far we have come and what we still struggle against.

r-gkSte4QdA,Adekunle Gold: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"This year, NPR Music is celebrating Black Music Month with an array of brand new Tiny Desk concerts — both from home and from behind our beloved Desk.

This month of carefully curated shows is a celebration of Black artists expressing themselves in ways we've never seen before, and of the Tiny Desk’s unique way of showcasing that talent. 

Ashley Pointer | June 2, 2022
Attention passengers: Please make sure your seat belts are fastened and tray tables are stored away as Adekunle Gold is ready for takeoff. The shape of the Nigerian singer-songwriter's Tiny Desk (home) concert mimics a flight pattern sonically and energetically, starting off laid back and ascending to greater heights that'll make you dance and move your feet.

AG's career first picked up steam after the release of his debut single ""Sade,"" a highlife cover of One Direction's ""Story of My Life,"" in 2014; then, he released his debut album Gold in 2016. Three albums later, the Yoruba sensation's sound has evolved from highlife to Afropop.

AG filmed his (home) concert with his band in Los Angeles, inside a retro, faux airport terminal – home of AG Baby Airlines. Opening with ""Sinner,"" a modern take on the Biblical story of King David and Bathsheba, the band's arrangement translates seamlessly live, with AG's smooth vocals complimented by violin and driven by steady, rhythmic drums.

Closing his set with the uptempo and jaunty ""Okay,"" a reliable banger from his record Afro Pop, Vol. 1, AG explains: ""It's such an energy giver — the people turn up, and we are about to turn up now."" Embarking on his first North American Tour Catch Me If You Can, which has its first stop today in Boston — as noted on the AG Baby Airlines signage — ""turn up"" is precisely the correct term as AG Baby is letting you know that he may be bringing his signature soulful Afropop to a city near you.

M1mg0yLDzvU,Svaneborg Kardyb: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Kara Frame | May 25, 2022
Svaneborg Kardyb’s Tiny Desk (home) concert was recorded in the countryside of Djursland, Denmark. “You have to drive for a while on a gravel road, and then you come to a lovely old house surrounded by hills and a stream on one side and a very flat landscape on the other, where you can see 10 miles away,” the band wrote to us, describing the location of the shoot. It’s this place that inspired Svaneborg Kardyb’s second album, Haven. “‘Haven’” (means garden in Danish). Haven celebrates places we like to be,” the duo writes.

The Danish jazz duo is composed of Nikolaj Svaneborg — on the Wurlitzer, synthesizer and piano, and Jonas Kardyb — on drums and percussion. Their instrumentation set-up is untraditional, with the drums and keys facing each other, a position that they play in on stage just as they do in Jonas’ kitchen and living room here. They open up their set with the title track from Haven, which begins with a quiet melody over an effervescent loop. The sound mimics the shimmy of leaves in the breeze. 

This concert is the soundtrack for lying beneath a tree canopy and watching the sun illuminate each leaf, seeing the veins clearly as the sun makes its way down to reach each branch. Immersing yourself in nature is grounding, which is reflected in Jonas’ last line describing their (home) concert: “The countryside reminds you that it is lovely to place both feet in the grass.”

JgOWuWchf88,Ada Lea: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Marissa Lorusso | May 24, 2022
Ada Lea's Tiny Desk (home) concert opens just as her 2021 album, one hand on the steering wheel the other sewing a garden, does: with the careening, beautiful track ""damn."" It's the story of a turbulent New Year's Eve party, told through songwriter Alexandra Levy's stream-of-conscious delivery. Here, she and her band lean into the song's slowly simmering tension and frustration, ending on an extremely close shot of Levy's expressive face in the song's final moments.

As Ada Lea, Levy excels at writing observational, artful indie rock; one hand..., her sophomore album, feels like a companion for driving around a city you know well and feeling a pang of nostalgia on every other block. In fact, many of the songs capture life in and around Montreal, where Levy grew up — fittingly, this (home) concert was shot at that city's storied recording studio Hotel2Tango. The songs are sharply detailed and dreamy — like ""partner,"" the second song in this set, which Levy says is a continuation of the story in ""damn."" For ""writer in ny,"" Levy relocates with her guitar to a sofa; bandmate Felicity DeCarle, who also plays synth during the performance, sits beside her on the floor offering exquisite harmonies. And just as the album ends, Ada Lea's (home) concert closes out with ""hurt,"" a contemplative track about isolation and indecision that's made warm and cathartic in this rendition.

O2Twk386qm4,"pH-1, Mndsgn and Audrey Nuna: AAPI Heritage Month Tiny Desk (Home) Concert","This year, NPR Music's Tiny Desk is celebrating Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month with a Tiny Desk (home) concert featuring performances from pH-1, Mndsng and Audrey Nuna. These artists represent just a sliver of the cultural diversity that exists within the Asian American and Pacific Islander community, and each is performing a Tiny Desk concert for the first time.

Alex Ramos | May 20, 2022
Korean-American rapper pH-1 radiates much of the same visual warmth of his setting. It disperses around him, highlighting his bandmates, who are planted in the fringes of an intense blue backdrop. The contrast lends a sentimentality that's emphasized by the opening lines of his 2018 hit, ""Homebody."" Perhaps the setting — a nod to his parents who, after immigrating to the United States, found stable work in a dry cleaning business — makes the artist just a bit more wistful than usual. The song builds around its hook with cascading keys and airy guitars, insisting that hanging out at home is just as fulfilling as going out to party.

This tenderness anchors all three performances for the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month edition of the Tiny Desk (home) concert series.

After pH-1 raps about staying in, Mndsgn (pronounced ""mind design"") argues for the opposite course in his song ""Medium Rare."" But the core idea of self-care rings true all the same. ""Fear is just a comfy queen-size bed,"" he sings from a home studio, surrounded by framed art, records and plush animals. The Los Angeles producer and songwriter's voice is soft, floating above a spiral of dreamy, psychedelic instrumentation. It's hypnotic, but the message doesn't fade into the haze; you can start your quest for love and freedom at home anytime, he argues. Just follow two simple steps: ""Get up, and start your day.""

Finally, Audrey Nuna takes a raw cut from the deluxe edition of her 2021 album, A Liquid Breakfast, and builds on top of it. ""molars"" narrates the push and pull of Nuna's emotions, which ""come crawling back"" even after she tries to stifle them. Her voice distorts with the chorus, pushing down hurt. Covers of 1990s Korean magazines line the four walls that surround the artist, as if to reflect remnants of the past while centering her current self. And when Nuna asks, ""Now who's emotional?"" it's not only a challenge, but also a declaration of self-preservation.

I first saw IDK perform in 2017. An infectious ball of energy, he captivated the audience with every vigorous bar and step; his personality filled the large stage that he only shared with a DJ.

There's a similar vibe at his (home) concert, actually recorded at his house, with a live audience of neighbors and friends and a palpable feeling of genuine hospitality and gratitude. Look at the deep blue paint on the walls IDK carefully selected, along with other adornments in his lovely Los Angeles home. Visually, the room is vivid yet calm, and sonically, his music has that same kind of feeling.

He starts with a lovely, slow version of ""Puerto Rico,"" from his 2021 album USEE4YOURSELF. Its lush harmonies and dynamic swells get you ready to dance for his next song, ""Taco,"" a house-influenced, gritty song from his new album produced by DJ prodigy Kaytranada. The album's title, Simple., references Simple City, a neighborhood in Southeast Washington, D.C. He wants the world to know that the fix to helping disadvantaged Black communities isn't as ""simple"" as you think.

More songs from the new record keep the cool vibe going. Though a lyrical rapper, IDK shows his singing acumen on ""Zaza Tree"" and ""Breathe,"" a musical adventure with the catchiest hook — ""let me catch my breath"" — and a stellar guitar solo from producer Mike Dean. ""'Breathe' is the most ME song I've ever made,"" IDK wrote on Twitter earlier this month, ""and for me It's proof that I'm still continuing to grow.""

The set ends strong with ""The Code,"" a continuation of his new signature sound of alluring jazz harmonies, hard bass and driving rhythms.

It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Ann Powers | May 17, 2022
Filmed in Chicago’s beautiful brick Irish American Heritage Center during a recent tour, this four-song set begins with Fontaines D.C. singer Grian Chatten in the stacks at the center’s library, playing a button accordion and singing the mordant ballad “The Couple Across the Way” as cellist Maureen Dunne and violist Isaac Henry accompany him. An emotional touchstone on the band’s latest album, ""Skinty Fia,"" it’s a taste of an unfinished Fontaines project: the Irish group originally planned to release a double set with half traditionally-styled tunes and half the searing, atmospheric post-punk that makes this third LP the band’s best.

But we won’t stay here in the quiet, unsettled heart. Chatten ambles over to the library’s open area, where the band is set up alongside members of the Northwestern University Choir to perform “In ár gCroíthe go deo.” The eerie blend of the choir’s harmonies and the band’s droning, building rhythms moves this music from storytelling to poetry. The song is a keen: an Irish lament for a dead woman whose family wanted the song’s title phrase inscribed on her grave but were thwarted when officials in their English hometown demanded a translation. “Gone is the night, gone is the day,” Chatten sings through gritted teeth as the choir and his bandmates chant those lost Irish words. Another library corner offers a dynamic shift, as Carlos O’Connell leads the tender, drifting “Big Shot” with delicate keyboard. Then it’s back to the noise with “Nabokov” — the perfect tune for tearing up an archive — and a final surprise sends the set into happy chaos.

""Tiny Desk at home? I kinda live on the road!"" the legendary Buffy Sainte-Marie exclaims one song into her high-spirited set recorded a few miles outside Toronto at the beginning of the 81-year-old's umpteenth tour. Sainte-Marie has always been a wandering soul with a fierce sense of direction. The four songs she performs here with her touring band span her nearly 60-year career, connecting her righteous protest songs – including ""Universal Soldier,"" as relevant today as it was when it became an anthem during the Vietnam War – to the love songs that have soundtracked countless slow dances. This set is a kind of Sainte-Marie primer, touching on her early days as the 1960s folk revival's brashest innovator and her mid-career turns writing country and pop hits like this set's smooth closer, ""Up Where We Belong,"" which won her an Academy Award for best original song in 1983.

Playing a Yamaha ""Silent Guitar,"" designed for road conditions where playing on headphones might be a requirement on a tour bus, and then switching to a small keyboard, Sainte-Marie is an easeful band leader. This occasion was, in fact, her first reunion with her touring band since the pandemic began, and their joy in playing these songs is palpable. Check out Matt Starr's rolling drum fills on ""It's My Way"" and bassist Mark Olexson's tender twinning with Sainte-Marie's guitar on ""Until It's Time for You to Go."" But mostly, revel in Sainte-Marie's inimitable spirit, one of the greatest sparks popular music has ignited.

qXibG3pG4zM,ARC Ensemble: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Tom Huizenga | May 11, 2022
The conflicts between Russia and Ukraine reach far and wide, even deep into this Tiny Desk (home) concert performed by the ARC Ensemble — artists from Canada's Royal Conservatory in Toronto. They offer music by the neglected composer Dmitri Klebanov, a Ukrainian Jew whose career was sidelined by the Stalin regime when his First Symphony was denounced in 1949.

Klebanov wrote his Fourth String Quartet — from which the ensemble plays excerpts — three years earlier. He dedicated it to his compatriot, the composer Mykola Leontovych who, as a Ukrainian separatist, was murdered by the Soviet secret police in 1921.

The opening movement will sound familiar. Klebanov riffs on a Leontovych melody best known in the West as the Christmas chestnut ""Carol of the Bells."" The sparkling second movement, played largely in pizzicato, again draws from a Leontovych tune, this time inspired by the Hungarian bagpipe. Listen for the wheezy drone in the viola.

To introduce the final, folk music-inspired section, cellist Tom Wiebe recalls stories from his Ukrainian grandfather. As a musician, he formed an ensemble of string players who stuck together through the Russian Revolution and the following civil war. They even played, reluctantly, for Soviet Red Army soldiers who occupied their village. Wiebe's parents left Ukraine in the 1920s and settled in Canada.

The ARC Ensemble dedicates this performance to the people of Ukraine.

HJDx_8PIqxk,Aoife O'Donovan: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Stephen Thompson | May 9, 2022
Ideally, musicians recording Tiny Desk (home) concerts adhere to the series’ core concept and perform behind some sort of desk, tiny or otherwise. But, barring that, it helps to make bookshelves your backdrop. When Aoife O’Donovan assembled her band at Portsmouth Book & Bar in Portsmouth, N.H., she made sure to note her surroundings: “It’s great to be here, surrounded by all these books.”

The Bostonian singer-songwriter, who these days splits her time between a solo career and her work with the Grammy-winning supergroup I’m With Her, has a sound nicely suited for bookish locales: O’Donovan’s warm folk-pop music conjures memories of the Northeast folk boom of the ’90s, the soaring plaintiveness of Indigo Girls and the winsome lilt of modern bluegrass, elevated by a voice that’s searching and friendly.

Backed by guitarist and singer Isa Burke (from the band Lula Wiles), bassist Ethan Jodziewicz (who’s toured with The Milk Carton Kids and others) and drummer Robin MacMillan, O’Donovan performed four songs from her gorgeous new album Age of Apathy. For the title track, they were joined by Virginia’s Yasmin Williams — herself a Tiny Desk veteran, not to mention one of the most inventive and surprising guitarists around.

ymqKPz5kRXE,Little Shop of Horrors: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Josh Rogosin | May 6, 2022
Composer Alan Menken beams with pride as he introduces the Little Shop of Horrors Tiny Desk (home) concert. May 6, 2022 marks the 40th anniversary of the show's first production. Menken is joined by the stellar cast of the current off-Broadway revival, which swept the Drama Desk, Outer Critics and Drama League Awards for Best Musical Revival. They perform a joyful medley of five earworm-filled tunes from the cult classic. Over the course of the tiny concert, Menken shares anecdotes about collaborating with the show's late lyricist Howard Ashman. It's obvious how much they loved working together hearing him reminisce.

It may come as a surprise when the composer sits down at the piano to sing ""Somewhere That's Green,"" one of the most iconic songs usually performed by the show's female lead. It's a melody he admits you might recognize from The Little Mermaid. ""This is one of the first songs Howard and I wrote for Little Shop,'' Menken explains. ""It's kind of the classic 'I want' song, a phrase that Howard [Ashman] would use a lot, especially when we would talk endlessly about our Disney movies. ... When we wrote 'Part of Your World' we actually jokingly called it 'Somewhere That's Wet.'"" Good artists copy; great artists steal (from themselves, if they're smart).

The joy the cast shares while performing these wonderful songs with their composer is palpable. If you find yourself planning a trip to New York, do yourself a favor and book tickets to this heartfelt production, which should run at the Westside Theatre for a long time to come.

Nikki Birch | May 4, 2022
The velvety sapphire of what may be the most recognizable curtains in jazz are the backdrop for this special Tiny Desk (home) concert. Dapper and distinguished in matching ties, legendary bassist Ron Carter and the members of his trio sit comfortably on the prestigious stage of The Blue Note in Manhattan. This is jazz with a capital J, complete with cocktails and ""Candlelight."" The first tune in this set romances us, inviting deep sighs as the lushness of the trio's intricate interplay carries us away to moments spent gazing deeply into the eyes of a lover.

Ron Carter's career spans 60 years. It includes playing with the greatest of the greats in jazz, plus film scoring, teaching, writing and numerous awards, from Grammys to a Guinness World Record as the most-recorded bassist in history. After the first song of this set ends, the soft-spoken maestro in pinstripes gives a simple introduction; then, we are treated to a taste of his mastery with a solo bass performance entitled ""Blues for Tiny Desk.""

Russell Malone and Donald Vega again join Carter for the final song, ""Eddie's Theme."" The way they share sonic space is truly a testament to the sense of community that jazz fosters. We see how they exchange glances, looking and listening as they give space and support each other musically, celebrating free expression. We are honored and delighted to join in the celebration as we wish this jazz luminary a very happy 85th birthday today. May the 4th be with you.

lsg1BCISPNU,Thee Sinseers: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Felix Contreras | May 2, 2022
To appreciate the magic of a performance from Thee Sinseers, you have to understand the co-mingling of Chicano and African American communities in post-World War II, Southern California. Living in the same neighborhoods, these communities created a virtual symphony of R&B, mariachi and boleros. And what you hear in this California band's Tiny Desk (home) concert, as they perform among plants in a flower shop, builds on a legacy of music that became known as ""oldies but goodies"" in the Chicano community.

Right from the start, band leader and vocalist Joey Quiñones and his crew dig deep with their original songs that pay homage to the oldies in a way that evokes my own memories of lowrider car shows and lazy Sunday afternoons at Roeding Park in Fresno, Calif. ""What's His Name"" features a delicate falsetto that was popular in 1950s R&B. The short horn parts and the doo-wop background vocals fall into a call and response backdrop for lyrics about a broken heart.

There is a very real connection in this set between the passionate vocals of the best R&B ballads and mariachi ranchera, both borrowing from the emotional devastation of Italian opera. That's all on display in ""Hold On,"" which makes us question how we have the power to keep on living. Particular attention has to be paid to vocalist Adriana Flores' delicate pleading on ""Lovin You,"" which crescendos into a blown out ballad powered by a tight, shouted chorus from the entire band.

gnKRe1-zF28,Roger Eno: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Tom Huizenga | April 27, 2022
Roger Eno’s home is part of what once formed an 11th-century abbey called St. Wilmott’s, situated on the border of Norfolk and Suffolk near England’s southeastern coast. The bucolic setting mirrors Eno’s quiet, slowly evolving music which, for this Tiny Desk (home) concert, features five pieces from his new album The Turning Year.
 
Eno refers to his process as “decomposing,” taking the time to strip away all nonessentials to finally arrive at something more pure and perhaps more powerful. He opts for quality over quantity. Every note, carefully chosen, seems to have its own preeminence. At an old upright piano — with the sustain pedal firmly engaged — Eno taps out his slender but potent melodies, gently conducting his string players as they float above and between the notes, providing color and warmth.
 
While there’s an Erik Satie-inspired Zen quality to “A Place We Once Walked,” with its seesawing rhythm, the feather-light notes of “Something Made Out of Nothing” recall the deep ambient spaces that Eno created with his older brother Brian on their 1983 album Apollo: Atmospheres & Soundtracks. In his writing about The Turning Year, Roger Eno says he thinks of these pieces as “a series of short stories or photographs of individual scenes, each containing their own character.”
 
To close the performance, Eno introduces his two daughters Cecily and Lotti who sing an arrangement of “Bells.” On the album, it’s a typically wistful Eno piece for solo piano, but the harmonizing voices here give the music a lullaby quality — and offer up a taste of what it must be like to make music with the Eno family.

ObD7Qjai55Y,A Strange Loop: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Josh Rogosin | April 26, 2022
Rather than use the stage at Feinstein's/54 Below, the cast of A Strange Loop cram into a booth for their Tiny Desk (home) concert. The protagonist of the musical is an usher, so performing in the crowd makes sense. 54 Below played a pivotal role in the musical's rise when, in 2016, composer Michael R. Jackson performed a concert version for New Musicals at 54. Little did anyone know that the show would go on to win the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 2020. The cast reunited at ""Broadway's Supper Club"" to sing a five-song medley led by the show's author to celebrate their opening at the Lyceum Theater on Broadway.

Jackson explains A Strange Loop is ""a musical about a young Black gay man named Usher who works as an usher at a Broadway show who is writing a musical about a young Black gay man named Usher who works as an usher at a Broadway show... who is caught in a self-referential loop of his own self hatred."" The ensemble of characters joining him are a collection of ""fierce but completely obnoxious"" ""Thoughts"" — literally billed in the show's Playbill as ""Thoughts 1-6.""

The show at the Lyceum clocks in at 100 minutes with no intermission. Even in this small, Tiny Desk (home) version it's easy to get caught up in Usher's whirlwind of emotions as he's tormented by his thoughts. One can only imagine sitting in a dark theater with a bunch of strangers, laughing and crying, spiraling out together on Usher's strange loop.

UJMhvIlADYc,Feid: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Anamaria Sayre | April 22, 2022
From the line up of traditional Colombian instruments to the card playing interlude, every second of Feid's Medellín, Colombia pool hall performance invokes the feeling of charlando and cantando, chatting and singing, with friends.

Seamlessly anchoring all five tracks with a bass-emulating acoustic guitar and cajón-driven dembow, the new guard reggaeton royal brings unique instrumentation and culturally significant visuals to this Tiny Desk (home) concert for a deeply authentic portrait of a star on the rise baring a sonic piece of his soul to the world.

Flexing his multi-instrumentalist background, Feid brings in a new instrument for each arrangement of his hit tracks to represent the five different regions of Colombia in a comprehensive homage to his home. He opens with su propio region, using a tiple guitar from the Andean region on ""JORDAN IV."" Moving to the Llanos, his band breaks out a harp for a beautiful rendition of ""TE MATA."" He pulls in a tambor alegre on ""VACAXIONES"" to represent cumbia from the Caribbean region. Pausing for quick brindis, taking a shot, he closes out the show with two heartfelt numbers: First, an accordion-backed, vallenato version of ""AMOR DE MI VIDA"" for the Atlantic coastal region, and then a final pivot to the Pacific coastal region he mixes in a marimba de chonta on ""SI TÚ SUPIERAS,"" before leaving the hall and riding off on a motorcycle.

The Colombian artist utilizes his full 15-minute set to depict an artistic and intentional musical image of his home and its rich sonic diversity, bringing the people, place and spirit behind a global genre center stage.

mpdZZhRBnOg,S. Carey: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Stephen Thompson | April 21, 2022
Sean Carey's music often evokes the comforts of home, so it only makes sense that he'd gravitate to the quiet confines of a modest kitchen in his hometown of Eau Claire, Wis. This is a Tiny Desk (home) concert in the truest sense: S. Carey performs these four songs surrounded by household appliances and a handful of his closest collaborators.

Carey's fourth solo album, Break Me Open, lends itself perfectly to confined intimacy. The record came out of an intense stretch of Carey's life in which the singer got divorced, lost his father and embarked on a period of deep introspection. But it's a record about growth as well as grief.

Of course, Carey had a clear musical path to follow, given that he joined Bon Iver shortly after bandleader Justin Vernon wrote his own masterful breakup album, For Emma, Forever Ago. Now, more than a decade later, he's the one healing amid the snows of western Wisconsin, just in time for the spring thaw.

izyBoVzC0Wk,Curren$y: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bobby Carter | April 20, 2022
Curren$y's Tiny Desk (home) concert features three key elements that make him who he is: cars, weed and, of course, music. One of the prominent champions of cannabis plays from the confines of a garage on this 4/20, a day deemed a worldwide celebration of marijuana. In front of a purple candy-coated 1965 Chevy Impala sitting on three wheel motion, the New Orleans native plays a smidgen from a catalog that spans over seventy projects to date.

His name would hold a place in the hip-hop rafters due to sheer volume alone, yet his consistency in the independent space pre-dates just about all of your favorite indie emcees. His formative years as an artist on two of the most successful independent hip-hop labels in the world (No Limit and Cash Money Records) helped develop the homegrown formula for his business. He's helped lay the groundwork for distributing projects online, selling tickets and merch without the middleman or radio play, for over 15 years. This set is mainly composed of fan favorites from his rise in the 2010s. Each song starts with the recorded track before the band takes complete control; however, they let the vocal sample from the opening number, 2018's ""Sixty Two Turbo Jet"" ride throughout. Spitta expressed his desire to play the Tiny Desk a few years back. There's no better time than now.

ICUoG54pIW0,Samora Pinderhughes: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Nikki Birch | April 15, 2022
The opening piano notes are barely sufficient warning to brace for the sweet and powerful voices that transport us to Samora Pinderhughes' Tiny Desk (home) concert, shot on film. ""The Cry"" heralds our journey into the Bay Area native's sophomore album, GRIEF. The vocalists move briefly out of frame for ""Masculinity,"" a probing, open letter that addresses masculine stereotypes with directness and compassion. The song blooms beautifully, with Pinderhughes accompanied by strings, a background chorus, and his sister, renowned flutist Elena Pinderhughes.

Between tunes, Pinderhughes greets us and shares that the setting for this Tiny Desk (home) concert is his exhibition, ""The Healing Project,"" at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco. Five years in the making, the project explores trauma and healing from structural violence with conversations, film, music and art created by incarcerated artists, including the artist Pitt Panther. Pinderhughes then plays ""Holding Cell,"" a dedication to those behind the walls. For his next song, Pinderhughes leads us to a blue space, a memorial shrine with candles, offerings and dedications, where we encounter the haunted pleas of ""Grief.""

Pinderhughes' ability to be vulnerable makes his music incredibly intimate. He reminds us of this quiet strength once again as he introduces the last song in his set, ""Process,"" with some final thoughts: ""I think a lot of times we get a message that we should just succeed or triumph over something that's difficult in our life, particularly things like depression or grief or anxiety. But sometimes it's about living alongside those things and just taking it one day at a time.""

Vz0wwYOV3PM,mehro: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bob Boilen | April 14, 2022
I find mehro's voice to be simply stunning; it reminds me of the moment I first heard Jeff Buckley. My favorite new artist of last year opens this Tiny Desk (home) concert with ""chance with you,"" a song of regret from his 2021 SKY ON FIRE project. It's the song that first grabbed my attention and is performed so intimately here from a rehearsal space in Santa Monica. His bandmates include Dylan Bailey on guitar and Callen O'Brien on percussion and a 1921 Steinway.

mehro's strength is in his restraint. The guitars sit quietly under his storytelling and that yearning voice has power without volume. He writes songs to express what he can't otherwise say. ""hideous"" is about someone he loved who wouldn't acknowledge his presence: ""Can't you look at me? / Am I that hideous to you? / Can't you talk to me? / Do I really mean nothing to you?""

Love and infatuation are themes that turn to poetry for this young songwriter and mehro embraces these well-worn emotions with a grace and beauty that is fresh and fragrant, ending this home concert with ""perfume"" as he looks inward while expressing outward: ""Heels over head in the bedroom / You smell so good, don't need perfume / I'm a tulip, you're the spring bloom / I'd be a fool not to love you.""

E4hevWAjUZI,Brittany Davis: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Stephen Thompson | April 13, 2022
It's a testament to Brittany Davis that this Tiny Desk home show feels like a true live concert — one with real live energy, as if it's playing out in front of a massive crowd you can't quite see or hear. It's hard to replicate the spirit of the Tiny Desk outside of the NPR offices: You don't get the visual sense of place, you don't get NPR engineers managing the sound mix onsite and you don't get the exchange of energy between musicians and audience members who are often excitedly discovering your music for the first time. Still, this set swims in that much-missed alchemy where everyone in a given room is carried forward by the same sounds.

A blind, Black, nonbinary musician from Seattle, Davis presides over a backing band that features six hard-hitting women. Together, they fuse rock, soul, hip-hop, pop and R&B in four songs — all drawn from Davis' debut EP, I Choose to Live — that teem with insights about identity, injustice, authenticity, motivation and power. Each song in this set moves at a different pace, from the righteous hip-hop fury of ""I Choose to Live"" to the plaintive slow burn of ""Loud Loud World."" But all four convey a clear sense of purpose.

Davis is signed to Loosegroove Records, the hometown label co-founded by Pearl Jam guitarist Stone Gossard, and Gossard has already figured prominently in Davis' career: The two share a supergroup called Painted Shield, which also features folksinger Mason Jennings and drummer Matt Chamberlain. If this set is any indication, Davis may well become the biggest name of them all.

USdiumz1ZFM,The Linda Lindas: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Marissa Lorusso | April 11, 2022
A library might not be the first place that comes to mind when you picture a suitable venue for a punk band — unless, of course, you're thinking about The Linda Lindas, who shot to viral stardom after a performance in the Los Angeles Public Library's Cypress Park Branch last year. For the band's Tiny Desk (home) concert, the teen punks returned to the library — this time, playing at the Los Angeles Central Library — with several members even sporting buttons that pledge love to the LA library system. ""We're playing the library once more,"" guitarist Lucia de la Garza says with a smile, in awe of the ""cool space."" (It feels fitting — after all, having artists perform an intimate, powerful set under daytime office lights is kind of the Tiny Desk's whole thing.)

The four members of The Linda Lindas – sisters Mila de la Garza and Lucia de la Garza, their cousin Eloise Wong and their family friend Bela Salazar – first played together in 2018, as members of a new-wave cover band put together by Kristin Kontrol of Dum Dum Girls. Soon after that, they formed their own punk group, going on to open for artists like Bikini Kill, Alice Bag and Best Coast.

In the band's Tiny Desk (home) concert, each of the members — all between 11 and 17 — take turns singing, starting with ""Growing Up,"" the title track to the band's debut album, sung by guitarist Lucia. After a couple upbeat tracks sung by drummer Mila and bassist Wong about friendship and frustration, the band is joined by an additional percussionist. ""We put an advertisement in the library a few days ago,"" Lucia jokes, before introducing Spencer Lere of the band Bleached (who is also, Mila points out, her drum teacher) for a surfy track sung in Spanish by guitarist Salazar. The band ends its set with the scorching ""Racist, Sexist Boy."" Co-written by Mila and her cousin, it's the song that first caught the internet's attention with its powerfully righteous anger about a racist incident Mila experienced in the early days of the pandemic. ""Here we go — let's blow the roof off,"" Lucia says dryly just before the final song — but given how hard these four rock, you'd be forgiven for thinking she's not joking at all.

6hpERoSmq74,Leif Ove Andsnes: Tiny Desk (home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.



Tom Huizenga | April 8, 2022

The Norwegian pianist Leif Ove Andsnes is binging Mozart. He's just released his second double album in a row of the composer's piano music, and for this very special Tiny Desk performance, he takes us inside Mozart's own home in Vienna, just steps away from the medieval St. Stephen's Cathedral and a couple blocks from a McDonald's.

Mozart might have appreciated the convenience of the fast food chain, as the years he spent in this two-floor, four-bedroom apartment (from 1784 to 1787) were a non-stop frenzy of activities. Andsnes says the composer threw gambling parties, taught students and, above all, composed some of his most groundbreaking music in this house, including the two works heard in this recital.

Andsnes begins with four minutes of radiant joy and virtuosity. The D major Rondo showcases not only Mozart's own skills as an unrivaled keyboardist, but also his genius as a composer with a bottomless bag of tricks to play with the music's principal theme.

The following Fantasia in C minor, composed one year earlier, in 1785, couldn't be more different. At three times the Rondo's length, it begins in a foreboding tone, with heavy, darkly colored chords, sounding perhaps like Beethoven in a bad mood. But the clouds soon open to rays of sunshine in melodies only Mozart could create, including a recurring passage of intense delicacy and yearning, which Andsnes delivers with the sensitivity of a lover's whisper. In its many fascinating mood swings, the piece feels like Mozart simply sat down in these rooms and improvised his mixed emotions. And thanks to Andsnes, we can catch a vibe of what that might have sounded like.

iYAnixLQno4,Maren Morris: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Ann Powers | April 4, 2022
Maren Morris is the country artist most gracefully poised at the spot where future thinking meets time-honored ways. Consider the setting for her second Tiny Desk performance — this time a (home) Concert — and the first filmed in her hometown of Nashville, Tenn. Morris and her band offer (mostly) songs from her new album, Humble Quest, in a luxuriously curtained corner of the city's new Soho House, the private club that typifies 21st century luxe leisure — this one housed in the May Hosiery building, a landmark harkening back to Music City's industrial past.

The four songs in this set likewise apply her highly attuned sensibility to classic song subjects: the value of hard work, the intimacy of marriage and the rejuvenating power of a great song. From the low-riding ""Circles Around This Town"" to ""The Bones,"" the chart-topping ballad that secured her place on wedding playlists forevermore, Morris delivers her songs with clear-eyed passion as the band — all behind-the-scenes Nashville stars, including Side Piece member Annie Clements on bass and background vocals — locks in to her every cue. Humble Quest is, for Morris, a triumph in a personal key, and this mini-concert shows just why she's both revolutionary and relatable.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Fitting many people into a small space has been key to the Tiny Desk formula since its  beginning, so it only makes sense that Madi Diaz would perpetuate the tradition as she presides over a “tiny living room” concert in her Nashville, Tenn. home. “Never have there been so many people in this apartment,” she notes between songs.

Diaz’s living room may not have been designed to accommodate a four-piece string section and a drummer, but together these six musicians make beautiful work of four tracks from the singer-songwriter’s stunning 2021 sleeper History of a Feeling. Opening with “Resentment” — a song she’d originally co-written for Kesha’s 2020 album High Road — Diaz steers her four-song set toward History of a Feeling’s quieter moments, in the process coaxing new power from career highlights like “New Person, Old Place.”

One of the strongest and subtlest breakup albums in recent memory, History of a Feeling works through a broad range of emotions with clear-eyed attention to detail and a willingness from Diaz to examine her own missteps and darkest impulses. So it only makes sense that in this performance, Diaz would give this material restrained arrangements to match — knowing full well that the songs’ beauty and quietly bold truth-telling would shine through. Her work has rarely sounded richer or more radiant than it does here.

5de8UjLRZBI,Tiny Desk Meets SXSW: Maxo Kream,"Every year, NPR Music participates in the SXSW music festival, whether it's curating a stage or simply attending hundreds of shows at the annual event in Austin, Texas. In 2020, the festival was canceled due to the pandemic, but it returned last March as an online festival. We programmed a virtual ""stage"" of Tiny Desk (home) concerts in 2021 in a series called Tiny Desk Meets SXSW. This year we return again, virtually, with another round of Tiny Desk Meets SXSW: four videos filmed in various locations, all of them full of surprises.

“I ain’t about to be on all that preaching s***, but Imma tell you this,” Maxo Kream says during his Tiny Desk (home) concert. “I came from nothing! The mud. Anything you wanna do, put your mind to it.” The sentiment isn’t groundbreaking, but if you’ve made it to the point in the video at which he says this, it’s impossible not to feel the passion of these words. His set is one of the first times we’ve seen the Houston native play with a band. They set up shop in an H-Town performance space, and the stripped-down aesthetic brings things that could be easily lost in his album recordings. The rawness of his voice cuts straight through the live instrumentation. 

Maxo Kream’s Tiny Desk (home) concert exemplifies the importance of storytelling in hip-hop music. His discography deals in-depth with the family struggle. It’s also a reminder for all of us to listen to the whole story. Otherwise, you inevitably miss a crucial piece of the incredibly complex puzzle of his life: poverty, gang culture, his complicated relationship with his parents as an immigrant son. He’s named after his father, Emekwanem Ogugua Biosah Sr., who immigrated to the U.S. from Nigeria. While the setlist veers heavily toward the trauma Maxo has endured throughout his life with songs like “Roaches,” “MAMA’S PURSE” and “FRFR,” he triumphantly contrasts the performance with insight between songs that indicate that much of what he raps about is now in his rearview.

ZJe0JcKLWaE,Tiny Desk Meets SXSW: Pom Pom Squad,"Every year, NPR Music participates in the SXSW music festival, whether it's curating a stage or simply attending hundreds of shows at the annual event in Austin, Texas.

Reanna Cruz | March 23, 2022
Pom Pom Squad's Tiny Desk (home) concert starts with a well-placed sense of irony. The opening chords of ""Drunk Voicemail"" – brash and heavy – tease the band's lead-in, letting imagination conjure up images of dirty basements and scruffy dishevelment before revealing the truth: five people in cheesy, matching red outfits, led by Mia Berrin in puffy plaid. It's a presentation that reflects the ethos of Pom Pom Squad: to give the often self-serious genres of grunge and punk a much-needed dose of silly camp.

Death of a Cheerleader was one of the most exciting albums of 2021, a modern take on the Sleater-Kinney ethos supercharged with a Ronnie Spector-esque retro sensibility. In its work, the group aims to deconstruct the idea of the ""cheerleader,"" allowing that central trope to make way for subversive choices both in image and in songwriting. Berrin writes romantically, but in a bitter, dissecting way, and her performance sometimes finds her at odds with the instrumentals; as the band tackles the standout track ""Crying,"" Berrin's voice beautifully cracks and strains, adding a dose of reality to the dream-like instrumental behind her – including touring band members Lauren Marquez on bass and Camellia Hartman on violin.

After ""Drunk Voicemail,"" Berrin makes it a point to say that she and her band ""grew up on"" watching Tiny Desks over the years, learning about what makes a great live performance from watching. Life imitates art, it seems, because the whole band is performing with a sense of seasoned comfort as it breezes through these five songs, inspiring even the most dour viewer to raise their own pom-poms and cheer it on.

Anamaria Sayre | March 22, 2022
Setting the scene with a winding tour of the jam-packed gathering of musicians in a mystical recreation of her childhood casita, Chicago-based singer KAINA offers her Tiny Desk (home) concert viewer a temporally unhinged invitation to come over to her house after school.

It doesn't take much to imagine what it was like in the vocalist's childhood home: salsa bouncing off the walls, arepas flowing from the kitchen, no one allowed to go home unfed (thanks in part to her Venezuelan and Guatemalan parents). KAINA is channeling that same casita-born energy into her performance here. She opens the performance with the title track to her new album, ""It Was a Home,"" a twinkly piece complete with nostalgic riffs and soft percussion. She mentions that she was featured in Saba's 2018 Tiny Desk, but this is her first time owning the performance herself — and she hardly takes a beat after the song is over to bask in the glory of her center-stage experience before she takes her time naming every person on stage – and off – who built the 15-minute performance. Moving on to her upbeat, zanier number, ""Apple,"" she brings more ""friends"" (instrumentalists, vocalists and puppets included) on screen for the performance. Closing with a full-bodied, chorally-backed performance of ""Casita,"" she once again takes the time to give the voices around her equal space alongside her own.

But her community – these featured musicians, the city of Chicago, Latinas across the country – aren't the only people she's elevating here. She's using this space, her casita and this moment in her career to speak to her inner child, as she describes in ""It Was a Home."" She's assuring her that when she's all grown up she'll use her voice to shine a light on her casita, beseeching the entire world to marvel at its beauty.

Id-t3IVNREo,Tiny Desk Meets SXSW: Yard Act,"Every year, NPR Music participates in the SXSW music festival, whether it's curating a stage or simply attending hundreds of shows at the annual event in Austin, Texas.

Before the English band Yard Act set foot on stage at the Trades Club in Hebden Bridge, England, the band set up its instruments in the green room and performed this Tiny Desk (home) concert. It’s a fitting location for the band from Leeds, which has around 70 shows lined up to celebrate its debut album The Overload including the SXSW music festival in Austin, Texas. Yard Act’s music is filled with brash sounds aimed at capitalism, equality, or lack thereof, and all done with both venom and humor.
  
Jay Russell’s drum machine sits on a tiny table and kicks off the song, with Ryan Needham’s simple bassline and Sam Shjipstone’s guitar tones setting the backdrop for James Smith’s narrations. “Rich” is our opener, a song that James Smith wrote imagining a world where one might actually make music for a living. James Smith told me that it was a kind of “hypothetical exercise in what I’d do if all of a sudden I had a lot of money, as someone who’s never had money and never expected to.” The lyrics humorously imagine the song being used in Hollywood films where the protagonist gets rich, and in turn making James rich. It’s a searing, tongue-in-cheek look at capitalism and our money-obsessed culture, a theme that takes different forms through different characters in this wry and compelling five-song set.

hjKXtAbYbSQ,Daniel Hope: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Tom Huizenga | March 17, 2022
Our Tiny Desk (home) concert series has brought us to some very special places, but few can match the distinction of being inside Ludwig Van Beethoven’s house.
 
Violinist Daniel Hope is the current president of Beethoven-Haus, where the great composer was born in 1770 in Bonn, Germany. Far more than a cultural curiosity, the house is, as Hope calls it, “the nerve center” for dozens of Beethoven scholars. It’s also a museum, library, publishing house and performance space.    
 
We often ask artists to perform at their own “tiny desk” of some sort. But the desk in this concert cannot be matched. On display, in front of Hope and pianist Sylvia Thereza, is Beethoven’s own traveling desk, a compact model he used to write letters and perhaps compose music. 
 
The music Hope chose for this special performance makes a most unexpected connection between Beethoven and St. Patrick’s Day. Beginning around 1810, Beethoven was commissioned to arrange his own versions of folk tunes from the British Isles. These were intended for amateurs to play at home, but with Beethoven nothing was ever easy. One of these tunes, a theme with variations, is called “St. Patrick’s Day,” which fits with Hope’s Irish heritage. The violinist begins with a bittersweet arrangement of the Londonderry Air, better known as “Danny Boy” when sung. But the soul of this concert is surely the slow movement of Beethoven’s Sixth Violin Sonata, with its aching melody that unfolds like prayerful song, wafting through the halls where the composer once walked.

Traditional: “Londonderry Air (Danny Boy)”

Anamaria Sayre | March 10, 2022
When catching glimpses of his meteoric rise to global stardom and his picturesque life with partner and artist Evaluna Montaner, fans are often left to speculate on the romance of Camilo’s life. From his Tiny Desk (home) Concert in Miami, the Colombian singer-songwriter pulls back the curtain for 15 minutes of soul-baring intimacy, letting the world view his fairytale life in full bloom.

Trading out his typical guitar opening for soulful strings, Camilo opens with a softer rendition of “Índigo,” a sweet dedication to his soon-to-be born baby of the same name. Setting the tone for his love-laden performance, he sings to an off-camera Montaner, Índigo’s mamá and Camilo’s querida, who trades her usual place as singer on the duet to serve as director for the performance. Transitioning to a slower “La Mitad,” his sweet vocals overlap with layers of singing guitar for a meditative rendition of the heartfelt track. When he completes the piece, Camilo pauses to recite a poem he’s written for the occasion, inviting the audience to explore the inner workings of the mind behind the music.

He transitions into a full-bodied, emotional performance of “El Mismo Aire,” complete with more silky strings and captivating percussion. Cowbell and trumpet converse playfully to create a resounding close with “Vida de Roco.” The Colombian singer-songwriter offers up a percussive bouquet for this performance, presenting each song with a novel depth of instrumentation and tone. He builds a dream landscape on layers of sweet drum solos and chest-gripping strings, inviting the listener to partake in a world where sound and heart perfectly coexist.

L5i4stj4M30,Abdullah Ibrahim: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bob Boilen | March 9, 2022
It’s less a concert and more witnessing a master thoughtfully creating an atmosphere, a vibe. And for 13 short minutes, I feel seated in Abdullah Ibrahim’s home in Chiemgau, Germany, witnessing seven decades of experience slowly dripping from his fingers and touching my soul.

Abdullah Ibrahim, now 87, has witnessed the horrors of apartheid. He grew up in South Africa and composed what would become known as the “anti-apartheid anthem,” “Mannenberg.” Nelson Mandela called him “our Mozart.” He also successfully made music under the name Dollar Brand, and worked with jazz legends including Duke Ellington, Max Roach, Don Cherry and Archie Shepp. In 1968, he converted to Islam and changed his name from Dollar Brand; more recently, he became an NEA Jazz Master. In my 18 years directing All Things Considered, I’d often reach for his music to play between news stories to give the audience a chance to think and reflect. His music is like that; it’s mind-opening. 

And here he is seated at his piano, his white hair luminous, his fingers delicate, while he reflects on the past and helps clarify the present. The music is from his newest album Solotude, a recording made to an empty concert hall in southeast Germany during the 2020 lockdown, which for me became a source of calm when it was released toward the end of 2021. To witness this Tiny Desk (home) concert, I suggest you take these next 13 minutes, turn off your distractions and discover the strength in delicate reflection from a gentle man who has some much to share.

L1l69tA5oCs,Patricia Kopatchinskaja: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Tom Huizenga | March 8, 2022
Violinist Patricia Kopatchinskaja and pianist Joonas Ahonen, like most of us right now, are concerned about the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Kopatchinskaja hails from Moldova, which shares a border with Ukraine and declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Ahonen is from Finland, which borders Russia in the east and was once under the Russian Empire until the 1917 Revolution.     
 
“We are outraged,” the violinist says. And the music the two have chosen to play, in her Vienna apartment, is appropriate in both its bold surface features and deeper connections. The two movements from Beethoven’s Violin Sonata No. 7 have never sounded more fiercely provocative. No dainty singing line in the scherzo for Kopatchinskaja; her Beethoven cries out with insistence. And the finale finds Ahonen’s piano explosive in its urgency. Beethoven, Kopatchinskaja reminds us, was a supporter of human rights and a defier of despotism. They follow with rarely heard, arresting music by George Antheil, a Trenton, N.J. native and Beethoven devotee, who triumphed in Europe before settling in Hollywood in the 1930s. His Violin Sonata No. 1, with its wailing blocks of sound and mechanical rhythms, defines his 1920s style which has been compared to cubism in painting.

At age 44, Kopatchinskaja is considered one of today’s most courageous, forward-thinking violinists. Her restless spirit has led her in diverse musical directions ever since she was a youngster. “My first teacher was the rain,” she wrote in a piece for The Strad. “I listened to the drops. They were the first short, round notes in my childhood imagination.” Thankfully, in this Tiny Desk (home) concert, she allows us to eavesdrop on her teeming creativity.

LaTesha Harris | March 3, 2022
Dearly beloved: we are gathered here today to get through this thing called ""Afro-life."" Surrounded by lush greenery and soft lavender lighting, Fireboy DML makes his Tiny Desk (home) concert debut from Lagos, Nigeria. The Nigerian singer-songwriter delivers the three-song set with an earnest reverence – his warm vocals reflecting a depth of passion and devotion best attributed to being brought up in a church choir.

Fireboy DML describes his wide-ranging sound – a fusion of R&B, Afrobeats, pop and alté (Nigeria's alternative scene) – as ""Afro-life."" This ambient, feel-good experimentation emerged in 2018 with his breakout single, ""Jealous."" He went on to drop his debut album, Laughter, Tears and Goosebumps, in 2019 and his sophomore album Apollo in 2020. A member of YBNL Nation, a record label founded by Nigerian rapper Olamide, Fireboy DML is pushing the vanguard of Afropop alongside contemporaries like Rema, Joeboy and Oxlade. His third album, Playboy, is forthcoming.

p3wLRo9zE5w,Shirley Caesar: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"NPR Music's Tiny Desk series will celebrate Black History Month with Tiny Desk (home) concerts featuring legends in the world of R&B, jazz, gospel, and hip-hop. Each artist in this legacy lineup has helped to define Black music as we know it and will be performing a Tiny Desk concert for the first time.

Mitra I. Arthur | February 25, 2022
During a moment of testimony in her Tiny Desk (home) Concert, Pastor Shirley Caesar declares, ""I'm beginning to feel something moving on the inside."" It is impossible to witness a performance from the ""First Lady of Gospel Music"" and there not be a moment where the spirit moves her to dance, punctuated — in true gospel fashion — by a band led by her longtime organist and music director, Michael Mathis.

As one of the most iconic figures in traditional gospel music, Pastor Shirley Caesar has amassed 18 Dove Awards, 14 Stellar Awards, 11 Grammys in addition to a Lifetime Achievement Award, and an induction into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame. During her seven decades-long career, she has collaborated with fellow traditional gospel figures including Inez Andrews, Dorothy Norwood, Dottie Peoples, Milton Brunson, and her mentor Albertina Walker, as well as contemporary artists such as Kirk Franklin, Whitney Houston, Patti LaBelle, Anthony Hamilton, J. Moss and Tye Tribbett.

Pastor Caesar recently became familiar to those outside of the gospel sphere when an excerpt of her song ""Hold My Mule"" went viral in 2016, shooting the song to the top of Billboard's Hot Gospel Songs chart. For those hoping to hear ""I got beans, greens, potatoes, tomatoes..."" be sure to stick around to the very end of this Tiny Desk — Pastor Caesar has a treat for you.

With a vast discography, this set offers just a brief sampling of Pastor Caesar's music ministry, including 2016's ""It's Alright, It's Ok,"" the 1989 classic ""I Remember Mama,"" the charged ""Armor of God"" and ""Take Your Knee Off My Neck,"" Pastor Caesar's response to the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer.

iX_ubL2-sfs,Patti LaBelle: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"NPR Music's Tiny Desk series will celebrate Black History Month with Tiny Desk (home) concerts featuring legends in the world of R&B, jazz, gospel, and hip-hop. Each artist in this legacy lineup has helped to define Black music as we know it and will be performing a Tiny Desk concert for the first time.

Bobby Carter | February 23, 2022
The first song in Patti LaBelle's Tiny Desk (home) concert sets the tone and quickly sums up the entire 15-minute performance. ""Something Special (Is Gonna Happen Tonight)"" from her 1986 album Winner In You is a highlight from one of many chapters in her fabulous career. A backstage corner of a concert hall in Austin, Texas, is transformed into Patti's world, furnished with a throne, flowers and trunks full of shoes. Options are a must, given a knack for kicking off her shoes during shows. The entire band managed to fit onto the set: thirteen people, including fierce background vocals, keys, horns and more, to recreate some of the best from the Godmother of Soul.

LaBelle and company go straight into hits mode after the first number. ""Love, Need and Want You"" is delivered with the same vibrancy as the 1983 original, with a wink to another hit, ""Dilemma,"" by Nelly, who sampled it 19 years later. The ballads continue with ""If Only You Knew."" She closes with the anthem ""Lady Marmalade,"" which was also revived in the early 2000s by Christina Aguilera, Mya, Pink and Lil' Kim.

Ms. Patti had already made Black History with Cindy Birdsong, Sara Dash and Nona Hendryx as the powerhouse group Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles (later Labelle). After the group disbanded, she forged through on her own as a pioneer in music, style and entrepreneurship. Sixty years and counting. Whether big stage or Tiny Desk, the standard-bearing icon continues to exude elegance and grace as a performer.

FrXXLcx4dCw,Buffalo Nichols: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Kara Frame || February, 21 2022
In a sparse, dimly lit Austin office building, Carl “Buffalo” Nichols stands in front of the mic stand with his steel guitar. As he finger picks into the first song “Living Hell,” the stark surroundings are juxtaposed against the warmth of his raspy vocals. 

He performs his Tiny Desk (home) concert solo, a testament to the engaging storytelling of the blues, a genre he reclaims on his self-titled debut album. In his three-song set, Nichols sings about not making it into heaven, living in hell and the life of someone who is lost and lonesome. But these aren’t your run of the mill, down-and-out blues songs – Nichols is adamant about making the genre current and making it Black again. Originally from Wisconsin, he mentions that he moved to the Austin, Texas music scene at the beginning of the pandemic, a fitting preface to his next song that starts with, “If you see me in your town, looking tired with my head hanging down / You may wonder what went wrong, why am I always all alone.”

Buffalo Nichols’ acoustic set represents all the best parts of Tiny Desk; a humble desk, a talented artist and music that speaks for itself.

cnrSu6sH-Ug,Too $hort: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"NPR Music's Tiny Desk series will celebrate Black History Month with Tiny Desk (home) concerts featuring legends in the world of R&B, jazz, gospel, and hip-hop. Each artist in this legacy lineup has helped to define Black music as we know it and will be performing a Tiny Desk concert for the first time.

LaTesha Harris | February 17, 2022
In his Tiny Desk (home) concert, Too $hort asks: ""How many artists you know that got relevant records in five decades?"" The Oakland rapper answers by performing seven songs from his own discography, showcasing his extensive (yet still underrated) contributions to the growth of hip-hop on the West Coast. The expedition opens on a quiet, reflective note with a performance of $hort's influential 1990 single ""The Ghetto"" before roaring to life with 1988's ""Life Is... Too $hort."" From his spot in downtown LA, BoomBox Studios, $hort delivers a dynamic, funk-laden performance, seamlessly cycling through scenes of women-chasing debauchery and politically-minded meditation.

Of course, Too $hort's set list shows off the development of his sound, but it also underscores hip-hop's evolution from a socially polarizing genre to a touchstone of cultural capital. Combined with an enthralling presence of persona, $hort's jaw-dropping lyrics and minimal delivery influenced West Coast peers, like Snoop Dogg and Lil B, and beyond, like Lil Jon and UGK; his career, one of moving cassettes with local independent success to moving multiple platinum albums with national acclaim, established the Bay Area as a credible rapping hotspot, pushing the boundaries of hip-hop. Too $hort honors this history by shouting out his many collaborators over the years and sharing his legacy as a hip-hop titan with a spirited group of musicians – notably Curtis Crump Jr. and Techdizzle who steal the show with, respectively, their sax and drum work on ""Gettin' It"" and ""Blow The Whistle."" It's a monumental moment for the Tiny Desk, and for those wondering, there's more than enough of Too $hort's favorite word to celebrate with.

qX9WE9-Pt2U,Anthony Roth Costanzo and Justin Vivian Bond: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Tom Huizenga | February 15, 2022
The opera star Anthony Roth Costanzo and the cabaret diva Justin Vivian Bond hail from opposite sides of the tracks, vocally speaking. But when the two unite in their stage show, ""Only an Octave Apart,"" something fabulous emerges.

This performance from, as Bond puts it, Costanzo's ""tiny apartment,"" with his ""tiny furniture"" and his ""tiny friends,"" gives us a glimpse of the show that opened at St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn last fall and landed at the New York Philharmonic earlier this year.

The show is meant to be comedic, as it riffs off a decades-old routine of the same name by Beverly Sills and Carol Burnett, but through the camp and the preposterous musical mashups, the simple idea of coming together provokes profound emotions at a time when many are forced apart by either the pandemic or politics.

Bond, in regal daffiness, bounces zingers off Costanzo's ""straight man"" with traces of Eve Arden's whiplash timing (a la Our Miss Brooks) and Catherine O'Hara's twisted bravado (from Schitt's Creek). The cabaret singer, in a husky baritone, leads the way in an improbable conjoining of The Bangles' ""Walk Like an Egyptian"" and Philip Glass' opera Akhnaten. Next up, Costanzo's pure-toned countertenor pilots an unexpected 2-hankie admixture of Christoph Willibald Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice with the Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush duet ""Don't Give Up."" When you're down and out, the song suggests, there'll be someone at your side.

And isn't that what we all need these days, a little more togetherness?

vvTXMeexv5Y,Catherine Russell: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"NPR Music's Tiny Desk series will celebrate Black History Month with Tiny Desk (home) concerts featuring legends in the world of R&B, jazz, gospel, and hip-hop. Each artist in this legacy lineup has helped to define Black music as we know it and will be performing a Tiny Desk concert for the first time.

Suraya Mohamed | February 11, 2022
Look around the GB's Juke Joint studio in Long Island City, N.Y. and you will see adornments from jazz singer Catherine Russell's home: a vintage Royal typewriter, a black dial phone, a red tiny desk and a striking Malian Bògòlanfini cloth that drapes the piano. Black and white photos of Billie Holiday and old-time big bands rest on the shelves and piano along with a copy of Russells' soon-to-be-released album, Send For Me, out April 1.

Two-color paintings hang on the back wall. One was purchased by Russell from a local Panamanian artist while visiting Bocas Del Toro, her father's birthplace. The other is from the studio's collection: an image of Willie Dixon, one of the fathers of the early blues.

Russell, a Grammy Award-winning vocalist, is one of the most recognized jazz artists performing today. Behind the mic, her satiny voice is robust and relaxed, and it's clear she and the band are having a ton of fun. They start this joyful set with a foot-stomping swing tune, ""The Darktown Strutters' Ball."" Written by the African American composer Shelton Brooks, this popular early jazz standard hasn't lost its bounce more than a century later.

Russell's music is informed by many early 20th century musicians, and especially inspired by the Black blues women of the 1920s. Her set highlights that influence with ""He May Be Your Dog But He's Wearing My Collar"" by vaudeville singer Rosa Henderson. She also sings a tune written by her father, Luis Russell, a renowned pianist and composer who was Louis Armstrong's long-time musical director. ""Lucille"" is a playful love story about Armstrong's fourth and longest-lasting marriage. The set ends with an inspiring bluesy song, ""You've Been A Good Old Wagon,"" one of the first ragtime songs ever published.

M9UMzNFJxhY,El DeBarge: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"NPR Music's Tiny Desk series will celebrate Black History Month with Tiny Desk (home) concerts featuring legends in the world of R&B, jazz, gospel, and hip hop. Each artist in this legacy lineup has helped to define Black music as we know it and will be performing a Tiny Desk concert for the first time.

Bobby Carter | February 4, 2022
Around this time last year, singer-songwriter and R&B royalty El DeBarge took to Instagram to take some requests and play a few hits. ""I'd never done anything like that before, and the nerves were showing,"" he told me. That 23-minute live performance ignited a comeback of sorts, and the greats of today, many of whom he's influenced, wanted to be near him. That video reminded us of his greatness, and stars like Alicia Keys, Fat Joe, and Questlove helped make 2021 a busy year for the torchbearer of the DeBarge moniker. For his Tiny Desk (home) concert, he didn't want to veer far away from what he did on IG, and I quickly concurred. He got together with guitarist, Bennett Walker to play this intimate set of DeBarge classics.

In terms of sheer talent alone, the DeBarge family was arguably on par with the Jacksons at one point. That talent propelled them to the stars in the 1970s and '80s, cranking out hit records and cookout classics. Switch, featuring siblings Bobby and Tommy DeBarge, came first. A couple of years later, the group DeBarge arrived, consisting of siblings James, Bunny, Mark, Randy, and El. Their five albums and El's solo work were a massive part of Motown's success and helped sustain the label in the '80s.

Despite the well-documented odds he's faced over the years, this set feels like a triumph. His voice has aged with grace, and that signature falsetto we've all attempted while singing these songs is perfection here. From his cozy home studio, the Michigan native breezes through a few of his R&B standards, including ""All This Love,"" ""Time Will Reveal,"" ""Love Me In A Special Way,"" and in honor of Black History Month, he reworks ""A Dream"" as a dedication to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

Fatoumata Diawara is a true multi-hyphenate – an esteemed Malian singer, songwriter and actress who left her home country at 19 to pursue her artistry in France. By way of Como, Italy, she delivers a riveting performance alongside her bandmates, many of whom have toured with her since 2018. The guitarist and keyboardist here – Yacouba Kone and Arecio Smith – both contributed to her Grammy-nominated album, Fenfo.

Rich, textured guitars complement her native Bambara vocals and bring a contemporary feel to her traditional Malian sound. These renditions are sonically disparate from her album versions. On ""Kanou Dan Yen,"" Fatoumata's captivating and calming aura is as contagious as her electric smile. ""Nterini"" is a touching ode to her lover about how distance creates enormous heartache. Fatoumata ends her set on a vibrant note with ""Negue Negue,"" an uptempo Afrobeat jam with rambunctious rhythm and spirit.

SufUZu4h_m8,Tori Amos: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Ann Powers | February 2, 2022
Tori Amos' Tiny Desk (home) concert debut takes place in what looks like close quarters. The singer-songwriter whose music has served as a beacon for so many listeners during her thirty-year career sits at her beloved Bosendorfer piano with a star-embellished Wurlitzer at her back. On a nearby shelf is a stack of books; one is Suzanne Simard's classic of forest ecology, Finding the Mother Tree. As Amos begins ""Baker Baker,"" a fan favorite from her 1994 album Under the Pink, her bell-like voice fills the room. It's easy to imagine she's in a lighthouse on the cliffs of Cornwall instead of the state-of-the-art home studio where her husband, engineer Mark Hawley, ensures that the mix will be perfect. This three-song performance shows Amos both alone and reaching out, casting sonic beams to guide us in the dark.

The other two songs Amos offers are from her characteristically fearless, self-interrogating, soul-integrating 2021 album Ocean to Ocean. Her renditions of the title track and ""29 Years"" are magnetic, but what really makes this set a treat is the commentary she shares before each song. Talking about the growing she's done during lockdown – learning about the climate crisis, confronting her own long-buried trauma – Amos reveals why she remains so beloved. She still knows how to make the most private and even inchoate feelings accessible. Hers is a lighthouse that welcomes the traveler in for a heart-to-heart exchange.

1D-QXrC3U0I,Amber Mark: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bobby Carter | January 31, 2022
In her Tiny Desk (home) concert, singer-songwriter and producer Amber Mark expresses more than once that performing for the series is a ""bucket list"" moment for her. Upon our first meeting, she came with the concept for her performance entirely laid out. ""The band is gonna sing backup, and we can cut to my family in the audience at the restaurant,"" she said. ""We'll make it beautiful."" With details that evoked excitement and nervousness all at once, the ideas felt massive to me. And what she delivers here is pretty grand, yet deeply intimate.

For her concert, Mark stuck to the script, shooting her session at Palma restaurant in New York, a place she's called home since her high school days. This Tiny Desk (home) concert is a celebration of her stunning debut album, Three Dimensions Deep, and is handled with the same intricate attention to detail as she did for the album itself.

The dimensions Mark explored on the project are what she calls ""without,"" ""withheld,"" and ""within."" We're taken with her on a quest for answers to questions tied to her personal struggles with self-doubt, loss and heartbreak. She starts her concert with ""On & On,"" which carries us from the ""withheld"" portion of the album right into a revelation of inner peace in songs like ""Bliss"" and ""Worth It."" Mark also slows it down and plays ""Waiting"" from her 2020 ""COVERED-19"" series.

The family members of Al Bilali Soudan, from Timbuktu, Mali, are sought-after musicians and griots. Led by Abellow Yattara, the band is a torch-bearer of quintessentially Tamasheq (or Tuareg) music, shaped by a continuous exchange between the tehardent (lute), vocals and hand percussion. The words sung are similarly percussive, like an instrument themselves. This genre of music has been performed for half a millennium by Tuareg griots to celebrate the end of harvest and the changing seasons, heroic warriors and noble families. --The globalFEST staff

Born from the rich musical and historical heritage of San Basilio de Palenque, Colombia (the first free Black town in the Americas), Kombilesa Mí fuses the traditional sounds of the community with urban pop. The band's members experiment with the instruments created by their ancestors (and introduced to them when they were young) by layering them between new sounds.

Over traditional percussion, metal handmade drums of their own design, and marímbula, Kombilesa Mí rhymes and raps in Spanish and the traditional Palenquero language, a fusion of African Bantu, Portuguese, French and English. During the performance, you'll hear them call their music ""RFP,"" which means Rap Folklórico Palenquero, a combo of cumbia, son de negro, mapalé and son palenquero. --The globalFEST staff

With one foot in the world of tradition and another in glitzy, upbeat pop, ADG7 (Ak Dan Gwang Chil) is a multi-award winning group inspired by Korea's sacred, shamanic ritual music (gut) and beloved folk songs (minyo) of Hwanghae Province in the northern reaches of the peninsula.

Performing from Hyehwa, Korea, their powerful performance presents the spiritual blessings and positive energy of traditional music in a thoroughly modern and often comical style. ADG7 was organized in 2015, the year Korea commemorated its 70th anniversary of national liberation, and first performed in-person at globalFEST in January 2020. --The globalFEST staff

Suistamon Sähkö's third album, 2021's Varokaa! Hengenvaara (loosely translated: ""Beware! Danger to Life""), is both their most accessible and wildest material to date.

SB6jTKPOjMY,Jake Xerxes Fussell: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Maia Stern | January 25, 2022
Jake Xerxes Fussell's Tiny Desk (home) concert opens with the eyebrow raising lyric, ""I've got fresh fish this morning, ladies. They are gilded with gold and you may find a diamond in their mouths."" It was originally sung by a fishmonger in Florida and captured in a field recording. Coming from Fussell, it sounds as lived-in as his worn Telecaster looks. It's immediate, but somehow out-of-time. Fussell found the tune at the Library of Congress, part of his process of collecting and curating traditional, public domain folk songs, and reinterpreting them through his own lens.

Fussell recorded at a friend's home in Pittsboro, N.C., with Casey Toll on upright bass and Libby Rodenbough on violin, harmonium and backup vocals. The mantle behind them is adorned with a tiny desk surrounded by various vegetable-shaped candles. It looks so cozy in there, and makes me a little hungry just in time for the second song, ""Have You Ever Seen Peaches Growing on a Sweet Potato Vine?"" To me, this playful lyric evokes a smiling child asking a tough question. The three conjure up a lush instrumental that pairs perfectly with Fussell's burly voice.

The final song in their performance is ""Breast of Glass,"" a fresh track from Fussell's new album, Good and Green Again, on which the singer and guitarist continues to learn from and breathe new life into old, obscure folk songs. The record also includes three original instrumentals by Fussell himself to round out the collection.

It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bobby Carter | January 14, 2022
Midway through his Tiny Desk (home) concert, Cordae shares the backstory behind ""RNP"" from his 2019 debut album, The Lost Boy, and the early stresses he endured as a successful young rapper. It takes a comedic twist, but his father's insight sets him straight. The music industry hasn't tainted him, and he's choosing to have fun with it. There's an undeniably pure quality to his Tiny Desk. The entire performance exudes confidence, and his excitement is palpable.

He's put a lot of pressure on himself as the self-proclaimed ""best rapper under 25,"" but the DMV-bred emcee has a solid argument. With a critically praised debut under his belt and co-signs from peers and legends alike, he's checking all the boxes. From a rustic, elegant setting in Los Angeles, he plays a combo of Lost Boy favorites and cuts from his new album, From a Birds Eye View. The new music sheds more light on what Cordae is made of.

The emotional ""Momma's Hood"" and introspective ""C Carter"" round out the set with songs like the barred-up ""Sinister."" The mood flows perfectly for 20 minutes, and in between cracking a couple of lighthearted funnies about Tiny Desk, he stakes his claim and checks another box as a charismatic live performer.

Dy4pEFFbFsA,Mon Laferte: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Felix Contreras | January 12, 2022
It’s fair to say Mon Laferte is a musical chameleon. The Chilean vocalist’s output of late has covered a vast swath of musical styles from Latin America, from big-band mambo to electronic dance club jams with a hint of reggaeton, and a few stops in between. The secret to the successes of these stylistic changes is the level of imagination and creativity she infuses in each turn.

So, it didn’t surprise me that her contribution to our Tiny Desk (home) concert series is a visual treat as much as it is a musical one. The opening strains of “Tu Falta de Querer” introduce a cabaret-styled small orchestra and a character who appears to be left at the altar of a small intimate colonial church. She’s in torch-singer mode throughout the four-song performance; take these lyrics from the first cut: “Ahora domiré /  Muy profundamente para olvidar / Quisiera hasta la muerte, para no pensar / Me forro pa’ quitarme esta amarguara” (“Now I'll sleep very deeply to forget I would like, until death, not to think. I erase you to take away this bitterness”)

The 10-piece small orchestra is a combination of Mexican folkloric music and European chamber music, mixing the ukulele-like jarana, an oboe, a tuba, and the violins often used in mariachi. The arrangements are the perfect vehicle for Laferte’s impassioned combination of blues and ranchera vocals.

There is much to appreciate in Laferte’s celebration of the spiritual (the church setting) and the passions of everyday life (her torch singing). In fact, I can’t think of many other vocalists who would be able to pull this off with as much grace, style and artistic vision as Mon Laferte does.

Suraya Mohamed | January 7, 2022
Enter into esperanza spalding's safe space for healing through music and song with a Tiny Desk (home) concert of selections from her Songwrights Apothecary Lab, (S.A.L.) project. A constant iteration of evolutionary ideas, her songwriting workshop is both a bold examination of human existence and resilience and a guided research collaboration with a collective of musicians and researchers in the practices of neuroscience, psychology and music therapy.

""All Formwelas (songs) from the S.A.L. are created through our research, divination, intuition, musicianship, taste, inspiration, and collaborative effort to design songs that enhance a specific salutary affect,"" spalding writes on her project site, along with brief descriptions for each of the three Formwelas performed here.

""Formwela 3"":""a re-membering with the sun's vast and perpetual blessing as evidenced by one's own aliveness and capacity for creating within self and community an un-corruptible home-planet""

""Formwela 4"": ""the articulation of needs streaming oxygenation through your ancestral vessel/vein of infinite life""

""Formwela 8"": ""a sound at ease, with no urge to move from that comfort place""

spalding's performance here is outstanding, and her top notch band, Loving presences (aka singers) and the Magical dance presence (aka dancer) add a dimension of creativity that amplifies the music's message and nourishes the spirit. Green-screened walls explode to reveal a constellation of imagery that complements the flow of this seductive music. Be sure to watch until the end.

XfJkMTVWu3U,Turnstile: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Lars Gotrich | January 5, 2022
From basements to bandshells, Turnstile shows are a life-affirming mosh-pit ballet. You sweat, you smile, you stage dive, you shake what ya mama gave ya. At the band's Tiny Desk (home) concert, Turnstile's high-energy hardcore is converted into seven songs over 17 minutes, surrounded by an art installation by John Scharbach — those stuffed animals presumably pogoing and windmilling in your imagination.

GLOW ON, one of NPR Music's 50 best albums of 2021, is the rambunctious sum of the band's many parts – as much Bad Brains as it is Rare Essence and Fania deep cuts – but with its wild styles fully fused as Turnstile. Filmed at drummer Daniel Fang's house in Baltimore, these songs are all power chords, compact guitar solos, cowbells and fuzz bass, with vocalist Brendan Yates accenting the melody behind the keys. At shows, Yates normally bounces around with joyous aplomb; here, his self-restraint is commendable as he mimes out his stage moves inside an invisible bubble.

In the back half, Turnstile upsets the sequence: ""MYSTERY"" is transformed into a Fender Rhodes ballad before launching into ""T.L.C. (TURNSTILE LOVE CONNECTION)"" – maybe not the first hardcore bruiser to reference Sly and the Family Stone, but certainly one elevated by gang vocals. These songs from GLOW ON, in particular, tug at loneliness and uncertainty, but Turnstile offers a reprieve before we jump back into the pit of life: At the set's close, Yates and Franz Lyons lose the Blood Orange verses from the studio recording of ""ALIEN LOVE CALL"" to meditate on its existential phrase: ""Can't be the only one.""

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Mitra I. Arthur | December 20, 2021
An unapologetic expression of faith and gratefulness is paired with festive lighting, poinsettias and ornaments in this holiday Tiny Desk (home) concert from Jonathan McReynolds and Mali Music.

Both musicians are prominent in the latest generation of contemporary gospel and inspirational artists, incorporating secular sounds and outreach as an entry point into the ""good news"" of gospel music. They each follow in the footsteps of Kirk Franklin (and of Edwin and Walter Hawkins before him). Individually, McReynolds and Mali Music's output showcases a marriage of motivating messages and faith, with music that younger audiences are more attuned to. The duo came together last year to release ""Movin' On,"" which yielded ""good news"" of its own in the form of a Grammy award, followed by a nomination this year for their EP Jonny x Mali: Live in LA. Given how effortlessly they trade-off during this Tiny Desk performance, I can see a Christmas album in their future.

A captivating rendition of ""Christmas Time is Here"" starts off their performance as their perfectly paired voices float over an understated accompaniment, which includes McReynolds on guitar. From there, the pair treat us to a medley of Christmas carols more rooted in faith, with McReynolds singing triumphantly, ""In HIM there is no failure!"" during ""O Come, All Ye Faithful"" and Mali Music delivering a stirring and meditative rendition of ""Silent Night."" Following the medley, McReynolds and Mali Music treat us to ""Movin' On."" After another year of still contending with the uncertainty of a global pandemic, the lyrics provide a reminder that ""...my rearview can't compare to what God will do with my life.""

Bobby Carter | December 17, 2021
From Hilltop Coffee + Kitchen in Inglewood, California, our second and final Insecure Tiny Desk takeover is a total Los Angeles affair. The spot where B.K. Habermehl, Nnena, and TeaMarrr gather is also co-owned by series creator and star, Issa Rae. Our first collaboration with Insecure was an experiment just a few weeks into the Tiny Desk (home) experiment last year. We took what we learned and decided to run it back. Hilltop was featured on the show and the addition of L.A.'s own 1500 or Nothin' as the backing band made the refinement complete.

Southern California's B.K. Habermehl is no stranger to Issa Rae's world. She landed three songs on season four of the HBO show, including the jam that introduced me to her, ""Right on Time."" Here she kicks off the showcase with ""Time Off."" Next, B.K. takes us downstairs to usher in some ""Fun"" via newcomer Nnena. ""Fun"" was featured at the end of the first episode of Insecure's current season, and completely set the tone for the episodes that followed. The Nigerian-American singer-rapper dives deep into her low range and the result gives me goosebumps. We cap things off with a tea party, courtesy of Insecure fav TeaMarrr. Waving an incense stick, she conjures some seductive ""Pipe Dreams.""

srn5Cd9yR3Y,Robert Plant and Alison Krauss: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bob Boilen | December 13, 2021
What a remarkable sight to see the reunion of Robert Plant and Alison Krauss gathered around a couple of microphones in Nashville. It's been 14 years since their surprising and remarkable album Raising Sand and now they're back at Sound Emporium, the studio where they recorded some of that first record and the entirety of their new album Raise The Roof.

Huddled in the control room are an all-star cast of musicians, with Jay Bellerose on drums, JD McPherson on guitar, Dennis Crouch on upright bass, Stuart Duncan on guitars and ukulele, and Viktor Krauss on electric bass and guitar. All of these folks minus JD McPherson played on the original recordings of the songs you'll hear in this Tiny Desk (home) concert.

They kick it off with the rockabilly sounds of ""Can't Let Go,"" a song originally recorded by Lucinda Williams and written by Randy Weeks. For their second number, Robert Plant recalls a song he first heard as a 15-year-old listening to some great R&B by Bobby Moore & the Rhythm Aces. He and Alison Krauss put their hearts and harmonies into a cover of that song, ""Searching For My Love."" Alison takes the lead on the final tune ""Trouble With My Lover,"" written by Allen Toussaint and recorded in the '60s by the ""Lost Queen of New Orleans Soul,"" Betty Harris. These interpretations are delicate, gripping and so damn special.

IT9sB1e61BA,Mick Jenkins: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Rodney Carmichael | December 10, 2021
Beneath Mick Jenkins' smooth veneer lies a smoldering intensity. It comes across in subtle fashion, as he stays seated, cool and collected for the duration of his Tiny Desk (home) concert shot in Los Angeles. But like the embers glowing in the adjacent fireplace, you can feel the heat emanating from this brother's soul.

He opens his set with ""Carefree,"" a song from 2020's The Circus, that reminds us why living without a care isn't a universal privilege for Black boys. The Chicago-bred MC then moves to songs from his newest release, Elephant In The Room. Backed by a four-piece band, Jenkins alternates between sung hooks and intricate wordplay during a set that just simmers with soul. The highlights ""Gucci Tried to Tell Me"" and ""Scottie Pippen"" both find him contemplating how the best kind of love can leave you ""lost in the sauce.""

In a year brimming over with hip-hop, Jenkins' third studio LP may have missed the arbitrary deadline to make most year-end lists, but it definitely ranks among the best. He put time and intention into making this album – his last for the label Cinematic Music Group – and it's a luxury he says he's rarely been afforded in the industry. That frustration comes through on ""Stiff Arm,"" the second song of his set, where he puts distance between himself and the Klingons. If it's any hint of what's to come, Jenkins' next incarnation could be fire.

ZUYJ8_tBSSQ,Arooj Aftab: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Tom Huizenga | December 8, 2021
If you've been feeling a little overwhelmed with the world lately, you're not alone. Arooj Aftab is right there with you. The Brooklyn-based Pakistani musician transforms her worries into tranquil music. ""The way things have been unfolding, it's just madness,"" she told NPR recently. The songs she offers here, at a decrepit, yet generously resonant convent in Brooklyn, sound like an antidote for stressful times. Aftab's melodies float delicately and meander amid a chamber ensemble that includes Celtic harpist Maeve Gilchrist, classical guitarist Gyan Riley (yes, Terry Riley's son), violinist Darian Donovan Thomas and Shahzad Ismaily on bass and synth. And then there's Aftab's voice, smoky yet smooth, caressing words in the Urdu language.

Aftab inherited her native South Asian musical roots and then replanted them on U.S. soil, studying jazz at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. While her interests in music are broad – ambient, minimalism, reggae – her style is distinctively her own. ""After all these years, those things have all come together and are holding hands, a statement to someone who has roots in multiple places,"" she told NPR.

These songs are from Vulture Prince, which landed in the top 10 of NPR Music's best albums of 2021. ""Suroor,"" with its propulsive groove, speaks of the intoxicating nature of love (""It has made me a drunk, you being the drink""), while ""Mohabbat,"" as its polar opposite, features Aftab's elastic embellishments, lamenting over lost love. ""Saans Lo"" is solemn, like a prayer. ""Breathe,"" Aftab sings, ""gather the scattered pieces of your heart."" This is surely one of the most beautifully rendered Tiny Desk performances.

It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Sofie Hernandez-Simeonidis | December 7, 2021
Stepping into a DMV when you're about to take your first driver's test, while nerve wracking, is something of a milestone. And Olivia Rodrigo has been hitting milestones with frequency this year: her first album SOUR debuted at the top of the charts in May after the success of three previously released singles, most notably the viral ""drivers license"" (hence the DMV locale and its ""interesting vibes."") Her pop stardom may seem sudden, but Rodrigo has been entranced by music and songwriting for the majority of her 18 years, as if she's been observing the right moves from the backseat of the car until it was time for her to get behind the wheel.

Rodrigo and her band take on the Tiny Desk mentality as they experiment with arrangements throughout this performance, embracing new sounds for her songs. The set begins with an acoustic version of the pop-punk-ish single ""good 4 u,"" and a similar setup continues with the addition of an echoey, electric guitar in ""traitor."" ""drivers license"" features only Rodrigo and her keyboard, a shift from the recorded version well-known for Dan Nigro's production and the ever-present beeping of a car door sensor. ""deja vu"" starts softly with just an acoustic guitar until the chorus ramps up to a full band after she exclaims, ""Do you get deja vu, huh?""

SOUR tells the story of a first heartbreak, one that inspires an intense anguish most accessible when you're a teenager. That open wound, empty-chest feeling of a breakup, especially when you're as young as Rodrigo, is difficult to shake. The album allowed listeners to bask in Rodrigo's heartache as if it were their own, but as she dances around an empty DMV and laughs along to a song about betrayal, she proves that time heals all wounds.

bJUUnXZVIfY,Wet Leg: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bob Boilen | December 1, 2021
No other band has brought me more joy in 2021 than Wet Leg, and I truly needed joy in 2021. When ""Chaise Longue,"" came out in June, it felt like a gift. It's rare to hear a band's very first song sound as perfect as this one did, but that's part of the magic that Wet Leg exudes. Two dear friends – Rhian Teasdale and Hester Chambers — making music to make each other smile, then watching that smile spread as audiences catch on.

That song has a few deadpan lines lifted from the film Mean Girls: ""Is your muffin buttered? Would you like us to assign someone to butter your muffin?"" There's a golden moment in this Tiny Desk (home) concert when Rhian turns to Hester with the line, ""Excuse me,"" while Hester responds dryly, ""What?"" Setting off a knowing smile back and forth made me love the band even more. They were gathered together at The Ventnor Exchange, a creative arts space/record shop/bar/venue on the Isle of Wight, their home turf. And their band – Henry Holmes on drums, Ellis Durand on bass and Josh Mobaraki on guitar and synth – amplify the rock and droll sound Rhian and Hester personify.

They've just announced the April 8 release date for their debut album, more tour dates, and shared two new songs, which you'll also hear them perform here. The new songs don't stray far from the two they'd previously released, which bookend this Tiny Desk (home) concert. Part of the footage was filmed on VHS tape, a bit of a wink toward their sound, which has roots in the '70s. It's not nostalgic, but it is playfully wistful.

-MefNjyFer8,Sloppy Jane: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bob Boilen | November 17, 2021
Sloppy Jane seems to be as much an event as it is a band. And despite 11 instruments — including cello, two violins, viola, two guitars, drums, bass, and a trumpet — crammed into a coffee shop called Porcelain in the Ridgewood neighborhood of Queens, that only represents around half of the musicians on Sloppy Jane's new album. Oh, and I do need to mention that the album, Madison, was recorded with more than 20 people, plus a film crew, in the belly of Lost World Caverns, where they lowered an upright piano into the cave! So, it's safe to say there's nothing casual about the music Haley Dahl, aka Sloppy Jane, makes, and the commitment from her accompanying musicians helps bring these crazy ideas to life.

The drama in Haley Dahl's voice and body movements emphasize the complex and sometimes disturbing imagery in the songs performed for this Tiny Desk (home) concert. These are all singles from Madison, which Haley described as ""the best ambassadors"" of the record and that ""all the songs on the record are about the same thing: unrequited love and feeling like a monster. These three songs (""Party Anthem,"" ""Jesus and Your Living Room Floor,"" ""Wilt"") are the most tangible.""


Madison is out now on Phoebe Bridgers' Saddest Factory Records. Phoebe Bridgers was the bass player in Sloppy Jane during her high school days so it's a beautiful circle of friendship that has grown from a then three-piece punk band into this epic mix of emotion and grandeur.

Josh Rogosin | November 15, 2021
Company finally is back on Broadway this week after a 20-month hiatus. There were only nine preview performances before all the theaters in New York went dark during the pandemic. Now the cast celebrates its return with a Tiny Desk performance filmed a few blocks away from the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre at the CIVILIAN Hotel. It's the 35th birthday celebration for the lead character, Bobbie, but also a reunion for this ensemble.

""It is incredible to come back to this piece, this masterpiece,"" cast member Matt Doyle explains, ""a show that's about company, about togetherness and most importantly about being alive. This is what we get to do on the other side of this and I'm so honored to be in the room with each and every one of you. ... We're having a party tonight.""

The musical comedy Company, written by Stephen Sondheim and George Furth in 1970, was re-conceived by director Marianne Elliot for a critically acclaimed run in London that transferred to Broadway. The big change in this production is that Bobby, the lead character, is played by a woman, Bobbie. The audience is taken on an emotional roller coaster through iconic songs with Katrina Lenk, no stranger to the Tiny Desk, as she tries to find the purpose of being alive. (Ms. Lenk won the Tony for her portrayal of Dina in The Band's Visit )

My Tiny Desk colleague, Sofie Hernandez-Simeonidis, was one of the lucky few who got to see a preview before it was forced to close:

""While gender-swapping roles for retro media has been popular for years, it feels different for Company,"" she says ""An intentional choice that emphasizes the social pressure for women to settle down, get married and have kids. The heaviness of that was felt by the audience collectively, but it was deeply emotional in other ways, too. There was laughter, tears, but more than anything, there was celebration.""

Sondheim was interviewed by Stephen Colbert about the revival and confessed ""I don't usually tout my own stuff, but I urge everybody here to see it,"" he said ""You're gonna have such a good time. It's really one of the most entertaining evenings I've ever had in the theatre."" I'll drink to that.

K6NR9DYiEqc,Raye Zaragoza: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Sam Yellowhorse Kessler | November 10, 2021
For Native American Heritage Month, we wanted to feature Indigenous musicians that break out of the preconceptions that many have of Indigenous music. Raye Zaragoza does just that, planting herself firmly in the folk genre, a tradition often reduced to white musicians with acoustic guitars. She pushes back on the narrative of folk music being for a certain type of person in her song “They Say,” in which she sings specifically about a time she realized at one of her own concerts that she probably couldn’t have afforded to be a member of the audience. “They say that folk music’s for the elite,” she sings, “the wise and the old with a college degree.” 

Zaragoza is a natural performer, able to go big --  like on her 2020 album, Woman in Color --  or pare it all back, as she does in this Tiny Desk (home) concert. Her music reminds me of Ondara, an artist working within the troubadour tradition of storytelling, but unafraid to deliver incisive social and political messages. After all, what is folk music without something to work toward? “Change is a choice,” Zaragoza sings, “and it starts with me.”

""It's Indigenous Peoples' Month every month, don't you forget, mark your calendars,"" says Nicholas Galanin. ""I think it's important right now that we uplift and acknowledge Indigenous people beyond holidays or months, allocated time."" Galanin, who's Tlingit and Unangax̂, leads Ya Tseen and brings his perspective as an Indigenous artist to every aspect of the band's music and artistry. Even the backdrop of their Tiny Desk (home) concert is a house screen — the largest of its kind in Southeast Alaska — carved by Will Burkhart and Galanin (as an apprentice). The video itself was filmed at the Sheet'ka Kwaan Naa Kahidi community house, which is modeled after customary Tlingit Long Houses.

Minutes can quickly turn into an hour listening to Ya Tseen's music, which uses a combination of electronic and acoustic elements to create an inviting atmosphere. But his words are often far more cutting, literally so on ""Knives,"" which hides an ominous bent under an otherwise dreamy texture. It's the first song off the band's debut album, Indian Yard, though by no means Galanin's first foray into music; he's performed under other names like Silver Jackson and Indian Agent, and collaborated with the likes of Tanya Tagaq and Meshell Ndegeocello.

Galanin is also a prolific visual artist, often focusing on political and anti-colonialist statements. His Tiny Desk brings all the elements of his work — music, video and artistry — together in a single package.

Seated in the comfort of his home in Winnipeg, singing his song ""Lighthouse,"" William Prince emanates thoughtful messages of redemption and love. ""I greet you today from Treaty 1 Territory, Winnipeg, Manitoba,"" he says. ""What a time it's been, I've been at home writing songs this past little while, and it really gave me some perspective on something ... confirmed something for me. You don't want to let a day go wasted."" And with that, William Prince's baritone lulls us into his song ""Wasted,"" a song he wrote to his son but is full of advice for us all.

""What puts a shuffle in your shoes, babe?

That's the thing worth chasing.

Gotta love what you do, babe

So not a day goes wasted.""

William Prince grew up the son of a preacher and a musician on Peguis First Nation. With two albums released in 2020, including a gospel album inspired by the grief caused by the pandemic, he's been quite prolific. This summer saw the release of a single, ""Run.""

William Prince ends his Tiny Desk (home) concert with ""Breathless,"" the song that introduced him to the world in 2018; initially released in 2015, the later version we've come to know was produced by Nashville's famed producer Dave Cobb. ""Great songs will find a way; it ain't the singer; it's the song I was told."" There's truth there, but for me, seeing him in Nashville in 2018, it was undoubtedly his voice that got me listening.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bobby Carter | November 4, 2021
From an elegant performance space in Lagos, Nigeria, Temilade Openiyi, aka Tems, adorns hues that recall the title of her latest EP, If Orange Was a Place. As she slips into performance mode, emoting with her eyelids drooped slightly, she begins ""Found"" in her upper register before switching to that unmistakably rich alto range. That's when the magic starts.

Her music aligns perfectly with the Tiny Desk aesthetic: Everything is stripped away to reveal the feels. Over the past couple of years, the Nigerian singer's star has been on a steady ascent, beginning with the release of her first couple of singles, ""Try Me"" and ""Mr. Rebel."" ""Damages"" (performed here) was huge in Nigeria and helped put her name on the U.S. map. That slow and steady approach led to features on two huge international hits: Drake's ""Fountains,"" one of the standouts on Certified Lover Boy, and ""Essence"" by Wizkid featuring ahem ... starring Tems. Originally released last year, the latter was arguably the song of this summer (ask anyone who braved the nightclubs in 2021). Those two jams served as a gateway to what's becoming a substantial discography, and her Tiny Desk setlist tacitly implies, ""I know you love those songs and you'll love these, too."" She's right.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Anamaria Sayre | November 3, 2021
Every inch of Joss Favela’s Sinaloa-based, sombrero-shrouded “El Tiny” concert invokes the musical lineage of Mexican Regional music. Mixing soulful vocals with twangy guitars and a classic accordion, he opens with a sweet rendition of a genre staple, love ballad “Pienso en Tí.” Next, he dips into a heartfelt, piano-driven version of a song he wrote for his sister “La Mejor Versión de Mi.” Taking a beat between the tracks, he invites us to partake in the legacy of generations of caballeros that preceded him. “Yo soy de un rancho que se llama Caitime, Sinaloa, Mexico y con esta música crecimos,” he says, “esta música vivimos, y nos gusta porque son nuestras raíces, nuestra cultura, nuestra gente. (I’m from a ranch town called Caitime, Sinaloa, Mexico and we grew up with this music, we live this music and we like it because it’s our roots, our culture, our people.)”

After moving through an upbeat performance of “El Alumno,” Kinky bassist Cesar Pliego Villarreal joins the ranchero ensemble. The Monterrey native uses his bass to infuse a different Mexican tradition on three more classic Regional tracks: “Me Vas a Extranar,” “Bonita” and “Cuando Fuimos Nada.”

As torch-bearers of a complex and beloved sonic tradition, one can imagine there are moments for Mexican Regional stars where preservation precedes performance. At the end of his Tiny Desk, the caballero pauses and allows sweet accordion sounds carrying souls of the past to fill the space.

“Muchas gracias Tiny Desk,” Favela says, “por llevar nuestra música regional a tantos lugares,
y tantos corazones. (Thank you very much Tiny Desk for taking our regional music to so many places, and so many hearts.)”

SKJ5JyuP7WY,The War On Drugs: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Maia Stern | November 1, 2021
In their Tiny Desk (home) concert, The War On Drugs gather in their packed studio in Burbank, CA to let us in on the fun and intricate inner workings of their craft. After opening the show with “I Don’t Live Here Anymore,” which shares the same title as their new album, frontman Adam Granduciel introduces the band and asks if anybody has a capo. Suddenly a very thoughtfully crafted tiny desk with drumsticks for legs (and topped with a tiny lamp too!) slowly lowers down into the space, delivering said capo. Granduciel smiles, and the group continues with three more tracks from the new record: “I Don’t Wanna Wait,” “Old Skin,” and “Change.” 

Although the band’s big sound is fit to fill an arena, we’re lucky to get to hear it reverberating in this cozy setting. The War On Drugs’ fifth album, released Oct. 29, presents new songs that feel familiar and true to their sound. Originally based in Philadelphia, PA, the band’s members are now spread out across the country, but they came together to jam, demo, and ultimately record this album as a kindred unit. 

The new songs are about reconnection, change, and uncertainty. This line from the title track resonates with me in the context of the daily unknown the pandemic has brought: “Time surrounds me like an ocean / My memories like waves / Is life just dying in slow motion / Or getting stronger everyday.” There’s beautiful tension and a lot of joy in these classic ballads.

4MsoqUv5gv4,Ed Sheeran: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bobby Carter | October 26, 2021
Decked in a hoodie, cargo pants and coveted sneakers, a slimmed-down and clean-shaven Ed Sheeran stands surrounded by bookshelves and a host of world-class musicians. He’s flanked by music director to the stars, Adam Blackstone, who assembled the band and handled bass guitar duties. After opening this Tiny Desk (home) concert with his latest single, “Shivers,” Sheeran introduces himself and proceeds with more hits, new tunes, and a surprise throwback. 

The English singer-songwriter may appear acclimated to a live band, but it’s a pretty rare occasion. For more than a decade, Sheeran’s become revered for ripping down stadiums, but usually (and remarkably) it’s just him, a guitar and loop pedals.

The material released so far from his upcoming album, = (out Oct. 29), leans heavily into the ’80s pop sphere and provides glimpses into Sheeran’s personal life during his time away. Here, he debuts “Overpass Graffiti,” an uptempo ode to the endurance of long love. “Visiting Hours” is a heartfelt dedication to his close friend and mentor, Australian record executive Michael Gudinski, who passed away in March. 

Although most of the setlist honors =, Sheeran veers momentarily to take us to church with 2014’s “Make It Rain” from the TV show Sons of Anarchy. The choir only takes up a smidgen of physical real estate, but their voices manage to engulf the entire space, propelling the song to another stratosphere. He closes the performance with a quiet storm version of his summer single “Bad Habits.”

WEkXiSfnZpE,Circuit des Yeux: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Lars Gotrich | October 25, 2021
Haley Fohr's voice is built for cathedrals, but we'll take a funeral chapel. In Circuit des Yeux's Tiny Desk (home) concert — recorded amid the sepia-toned stained glass of the historic May Chapel at the Rosehill Cemetery and Mausoleum — Fohr's operatic, four-octave vibrato contains a wondrous terror, but also an illumination of being.

This unique setting is not merely a venue for the Chicago experimental music scene that Fohr calls home, but also a reflection of Circuit des Yeux's latest album, -io. In it, Fohr explores how grief not only shapes people but transforms them — that death (of self, of a loved one, of an idea) is not a finality, but an opening. On ""Vanishing,"" she brandishes a 12-string acoustic guitar distorted to disastrous peaks, matched only by blown-out drum fills and a string trio searing Fohr's ecstatic arrangements into sublime chaos. ""Dogma"" follows with a spaghetti-western riff, like an existential biker gang grooving to chirping synths and Fohr's deep howl: ""Tell me how to feel real / Talk talk talk talk talk talk about what's real.""

Much of -io was written on the organ and piano, instruments that allowed Fohr to expand her sonic universe. This set closes on the balcony's organ with ""Stranger,"" a song ultimately about empathy, and accompanied only by Andrew Scott Young, who bows an upright bass behind the pews. At the climax, Fohr's voice rips across the vaulted ceiling as if to split the chapel in half, and we're left in the wailing's wake.

1OVXpy4Rws4,Jagged Little Pill: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Josh Rogosin | Oct. 21, 2021
Jagged Little Pill, the Broadway musical based on Alanis Morissette’s 1995 album of the same name, reopens Thursday night after a 19-month hiatus due to COVID. The cast assembled at the D’Angelico Guitars showroom in Manhattan to record this Tiny Desk (home) concert, finally able to celebrate their long-awaited return to the stage. 

Lauren Patten kicks off the set with “Hand In My Pocket.” She won a Tony for her portrayal of Jo and spent two years developing the role. Diablo Cody, known for writing the movie Juno, also won a Tony for best book. She was able to adapt the iconic songs for the zeitgeist, covering topics ranging from substance abuse, sexual identity, adoption, sexual assault and more. The show received the most Tony nominations of the season with a total of 15.

As cast member Heidi Blickenstaff (Mary Jane) explains, the show is “about an American family in crisis, and I think a lot of people can relate to that.” She sings “Uninvited,” which has been reimagined to express her character’s struggle with opiate addiction. 

The song “Predator” wasn’t on the original album, but was co-written by Morissette and composer Michael Farrell just for this production. Its haunting melody depicting the emotional scars associated with sexual assault is emotionally engaging, both on stage and in this Tiny Desk performance.

It comes as no surprise that the show ends with the unapologetically optimistic “You Learn.” It’s hard not to be optimistic watching these talented Broadway performers, seeing how gleeful they are doing what they love -- especially after waiting nearly two years for the ultimate privilege of performing in front of a live audience again.

If you need substance abuse treatment and referral information, call the National Helpline: 1-800-662-HELP (4357). You can reach the National Sexual Assault Hotline 24/7: 1-800-656-4673

nKDoVuG7uZ0,Yasmin Williams: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Lars Gotrich | October 19, 2021
Yasmin Williams doesn't need much scenery to set your imagination in motion. For her Tiny Desk (home) concert, the Virginia-based guitarist keeps the background sparse (a rug, a folding table, curtains, a plank of wood) to foreground her inventive playing.

Williams' set begins with Urban Driftwood's ""Juvenescence,"" a tenderly picked tune that suddenly springs to life when she flips the acoustic guitar onto her lap to fingertap the dizzying variation. In the hands of others, this move signifies showmanship that highlights ability, but sometimes downplays the substance of the song. For Williams, technique and songcraft are one in the same; if she runs out of fingers to drum the body of the guitar, she straps on tap shoes (""Through the Woods""); if a quiet melody requires a hint of percussion, she strikes the strings with a mallet hammer (""On a Friday Night""). In these songs, the center is exploration — this Tiny Desk performance, in camera angles overhead and out front, shows us the tools that help Williams execute her vision via finger picks, taps, slides and knocks. Oh, and there's a kalimba taped to the body of her guitar, too!

""After the Storm,"" inspired by some Black Lives Matter protests Williams attended last summer, is where the musician expands her universe (and wardrobe!) in a four-way split screen of herself. Overtones from a 12-string guitar drift across a resolute six-string melody and, later, a harp guitar's swirling countermelody, and a brief backing from a fourth guitar. ""I was trying to digest everything that was happening,"" she says of the song, capturing the complex emotions that flood the way forward, with an eye toward hope.

nMlnt85iysY,Cha Wa: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bob Boilen | October 18, 2021
Gathered at Preservation Hall in New Orleans, a hallowed space for Black American music, Cha Wa's set begins with hand-clapped rhythms and light percussion – then, a burst of horns gives way to ""My People,"" a song that zeroes in on the disparities between the haves and the have-nots:

""Rich people living in paradise
Poor people under the bridge at night, oh yeah
Most people know what it takes to survive
But my people know how to do it and thrive.""

Cha Wa celebrates Black culture through the medium of rhythm, while also punctuating cultural differences with the hope of opening up the eyes and ears of those ignorant of, or ignoring, those differences. Decked out in a brilliant green feathered ""Indian suit,"" Joseph Boudreaux Jr. celebrates the roots of Mardi Gras Indian culture.

The concert, filmed during the pandemic, was a challenge for a band so used to the stomping feet and smiling faces of a sweaty New Orleans nightclub. It's something they thrive on – an audience can give as much energy as it receives, after all – so performing in front of a camera crew without that same energy was a challenge. All that said, the spirit and message of these songs, from their new album My People, come through loud and clear for a not-so Tiny crowd.

F7wIRxQEetc,Camila Cabello: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month with an ""El Tiny"" takeover of the (home) concert series, featuring J Balvin, Camila Cabello and several more musicians from all corners of Latinidad.

Anamaria Sayre | October 15, 2021
To the beat of her swishing hips and swaying percussionists, Camila Cabello's famous ""Half of my heart is in Havana"" reverberates across this musician-packed Miami set, with an at-home ease that feels novel for the global popstar.

Born to a Cuban mother and Mexican father in Havana, Cuba, Cabello is no stranger to blending borders and connecting worlds. As the final performance in our Hispanic Heritage Month Celebration, her El Tiny concert epitomises the cross-cultural, transnational musical identities we've centered over the course of the series. Each unique arrangement of her universal hits represents and explores a new facet of the identities and experiences that make up Cabello.

These stripped-down renditions of her hits ""Havana,"" ""Real Friends,"" ""Señorita"" and ""Don't Go Yet"" include more Latin instrumentation than the recordings — presumably bringing them closer to sounds that were first introduced to her as music during her childhood in Havana, Mexico City, and Miami.

The interlude featuring a sacred Afro-Cuban Santería chant and the following performance of the unreleased, Mariachi-based ""La Buena Vida,"" firmly root Cabello's El Tiny performance within two cultural traditions that don't typically glitter under the harsh lights of a global stage.

Here, we find Camila on the precipice of a voice that magically layers pop with tradition, holding all parts of a complex identity in seamless harmony. Flanked by Cuban congueros and Mexican mariachi, all aglow under the Miami sun, Camila Cabello's heart has never felt more whole.

RG6O-Qq79G0,Nicki Nicole: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month with an ""El Tiny"" takeover of the (home) concert series, featuring J Balvin, Camila Cabello and several more musicians from all corners of Latinidad.

Reanna Cruz | October 13, 2021
Sitting next to rapper Nicki Nicole, on a stack of books, you'll see an old Sony camcorder – throughout this six-song performance we cut back to its footage every now and again, the rough texture breaking from the pristine, offering a nostalgic sense of intimacy. It's a production choice that completely works and, in a way, reflects Nicki Nicole at large, as an artist born in 2000 and with a connection to sounds and styles beyond her years.

At multiple points throughout the performance, Nicki points and beckons to the audience, inviting them into her world, her lyrics, her sound. Every track carries a certain brand of swagger whether it be the intensity of her second song ""Mala Vida"" or her effortless, confident freestyle. Even when she slows it down, on ""Parte de Mi,"" strings and piano create an arresting connection between us and her – and her final song, ""Baby,"" is a bombastic head-bopper, enhanced by her deeply groove-oriented band, which includes everything from an accordion to a mandolin.

Fittingly, Nicki Nicole has a tattoo on her neck which, in English, reads ""bulls***."" She has said before that the tattoo represents her need to break free of the labels applied by both her culture and industry as a young, Argentine female R&B artist. If her concert is any indication, Nicki Nicole is here to stay, while moving ever further away from any preconceived notions of her artistry – the ""bulls***.""

h_a5zbizXCw,YEИDRY: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month with an ""El Tiny"" takeover of the (home) concert series, featuring J Balvin, Camila Cabello and several more musicians from all corners of Latinidad.

Stefanie Hernández | October 8, 2021
For a moment, it looks like YEИDRY is rising from the sea. She's barefoot and wearing yellow, like the roses on her side table tiny desk, Oshún's color. On the floor, below the seaside view, is a box of records displaying Celia & Johnny, the 1974 classic collaboration between Celia Cruz and Johnny Pacheco. To her right sits the 1979 album Cross Over by the Fania All Stars, of which Celia and Johnny were both starring members. From Soho Beach House in Miami, YEИDRY performs five songs, which make up most of her solo discography.

She opens with a song that's just as intimate as her space. ""Nena"" is a prayer sung from the perspective of her mother when she went to Italy in search of opportunity, while a young Yendry Fiorentino stayed with her grandmother in her hometown of Santo Domingo. After she turned 4, she joined her mother in Turin, where she grew up and started her music career.

YEИDRY's songs radiate with a feminine strength of many lives lived, from the sobered reflection on a past relationship of ""Se Acabó"" to the self-sure ""Ya,"" a song ""about the fire ... and the courage that all of us have inside. And sometimes we struggle to get it out."" Its first phrase, ""yo quiero to'"" (""I want it all""), is an invocation of remembering who you are. In ""You,"" her collaboration with Damian Marley, she inhabits the voices of both lovers with a seamless confidence. And in her closer, ""El Diablo,"" she adopts even the devil's power with a slow-burning flamenco that ignites into merengue as she repeats ""soy Dominicana / soy Italiana,"" honoring all her selves in the afternoon light.

-jLebs9xraI,Prince Royce: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month with an ""El Tiny"" takeover of the (home) concert series, featuring J Balvin, Camila Cabello and several more musicians from all corners of Latinidad.

Anamaria Sayre | October 6, 2021
After years spent working the global stage, Prince Royce returns home to claim his rightful throne in this Tiny Desk (home) concert. Performing his entire ""El Tiny"" set live from an unassuming barbershop chair in The Bronx, the Dominican-American superstar dazzles in this homecoming performance with the unguarded swagger characteristic of a true rey de la gente.

Prince Royce instantly grips ears and hearts with a stunning performance of ""Corazón Sin Cara."" Leading with buttery vocals and easy electric guitar riffs, he serves smooth verses with the kind of suave appeal that would leave any viewer wanting to be a bachata princess. Transitioning between tracks with a sweet note about representing la cultura, he dives straight in with more traditional bachata beats in a performance of his recent release ""Carita de Inocente.""

The barbershop is where the prince discovered the building blocks to create an empire in the image of a people and culture that feel like home. In an intimate moment between songs, Prince Royce shares that it was where he would go to hear what people were listening to in the streets — bachata, merengue, mambo. His New York Dominican sound feels natural in the space.
""Porque me recuerda a mis inicios (because it reminds me of my beginnings),"" he says of his choice in stage.

From there he delivers ""Lao o Lao,"" an impassioned song about willingly giving up lavish objects for love. He closes out the show with a performance of a tropical, legacy pick ""Darte un Beso.""
Prince Royce's ""El Tiny"" concert makes it easy to imagine a curly-haired kid sitting in that same, too-big-for-him silla, dreaming of a day when the chair would fit just right and he could come back to his barrio and own the seat as royalty.

jdHPotMqv1M,Sech: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month with an ""El Tiny"" takeover of the (home) concert series, featuring J Balvin, Camila Cabello and several more musicians from all corners of Latinidad.

Stefanie Fernández | October 4, 2021 
The first florid trills of piano wash in, and Sech is here to celebrate reggaetón in its home. The scene: the light-soaked Biblioteca de la Autoridad del Canal de Panamá Roberto F. Chiari.
Sech arrives with a book he places on the table. His blazer bears his name, the isthmus of Panama and its flag, and the likeness of Panamanian Yankee great Mariano Rivera and his jersey number, 42 (the namesake of Sech's most recent album). He approaches the mic for a silky version of ""Playa"" that, like the rest of his Tiny Desk set, is nearly entirely acoustic.

Sech's discography is itself a place of learning for the Latin pop industry he has reinvigorated. The history of reggaetón often dwells disproportionately on Puerto Rico in the 1990s, overshadowing its creation by Black Panamanians in the 1980s with plena and reggae en español, born from Jamaican reggae and dancehall and iterated in Río Abajo, Sech's hometown in Panama City. ""Otro Trago"" introduced Sech's honeyed, melodic vocal range as a promising young player in an industry enamored with its own reductive powers. In Sech's hands, reggaetón is given the care of a people's history.

Music fills every corner of the library, from the violin-DJ-bass trio nested in the second-floor balcony, to the background vocals, keys and drums (anchoring the whole thing in lush, acoustic dembow), to Sech and his guitarist and producer Jhon el Divertido in the forefront. The sterile fluorescents among the stacks shift to disco lighting for the bitter ex-text ""911,"" which eventually melts into an a cappella chorus. It ends on a melancholy violin riff that blooms seamlessly into the jazzy opening of ""Sal y Perrea."" Sech might be singing about stalking an ex's social media or pointing a newly single woman toward tequila to forget some payaso, but his modern textbook feels timeless in this hybrid arrangement, showing — as well as telling — the story of dembow and its power to heal.

fJNSgPqQ1yw,Eme Alfonso: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month with an ""El Tiny"" takeover of the (home) concert series, featuring J Balvin, Camila Cabello and several more musicians from all corners of Latinidad.

Felix Contreras | September 29, 2021
As you gaze into the space where Cuban vocalist Eme Alfonso performs her Tiny Desk (home) concert, you enter a place where music becomes a spiritual language. So much of her history and music is centered around the Afro-Cuban spiritual practice that some know as santería. In the 1980s, her parents started Síntesis, a pioneering band that performed secular versions of that musical liturgy through electric jazz fusion. In fact, her parents, Carlos Alfonso and Ele Valdés, join her on vocals on this three-song set, which she recorded in Havana.

As with all things spiritual, it's best to start off paying homage to all things greater, which she does with a track from her 2018 album Voy, ""Ayabba,"" a prayer sung in Yoruba and interpreted for voice and jazz trio (in this case, bassist Julio César González, pianist Jorge Aragón and drummer Oliver Valdés).

""Libre"" showcases the historic musical ties between the US and Cuba, as Alfonso's vocals reflect her love for soul and jazz. Jazz is also part of that long-standing cultural give and take, as evidenced by Aragón's masterful piano solo.

""El Bote"" features the preternatural family vocal connection between Alfonso and her parents. In an interview I did with her dad Carlos Alfonso, he told me the main inspiration for the choir-like vocals of their group Sintesis were inspired by Freddie Mercury and Queen. There is a bit of those stacked harmonies in the chorus, before a propulsive drum solo by Oliver Valdés that propels the song to a dramatic close.

Eme Alfonso is representative of the kind of music that defies expectations of what Cuban music should sound like. This stop in Havana during our ""El Tiny"" tour of Latin music is just the tip of the iceberg of the musical riches of contemporary Cuba.

S52_XxBwbJg,Silvana Estrada: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month with an ""El Tiny"" takeover of the (home) concert series, featuring J Balvin, Camila Cabello and several more musicians from all corners of Latinidad.

Anamaria Sayre | September 27, 2021
Silvana Estrada's angelic first note strikes, and for a moment her family's instrument workshop in Veracruz, Mexico, feels like a window to the heavens themselves.

Adorned in a white dress and a radiant smile, the singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist invites us to participate in a rich and varied expression of familial love and musical brilliance. She wastes no time entrancing her audience, using a stripped-down performance of ""Un Día Cualquiera"" — accompanied by nothing but soft claps and subtle harmonies — to showcase her impeccable vocal precision and range.

After a sweet ""Bienvenidos,"" Estrada picks up the Venezuelan cuatro — her most beloved magic-making tool — and jumps into a sublimely arranged, effortlessly enchanting rendition of ""Tristeza."" Then, halfway through ""Te Guardo,"" something extraordinary happens: the sound of stringed instruments comes out of nowhere, and as Estrada steps away from her microphone, the camera follows, exposing a string quartet set up just off screen. After that moving reveal, Estrada takes a seat and begins to perform ""Marchita,"" where strings, cuatro, and voice marry in indiscernible harmony.

Shifting scenes once again, Estrada moves outside and we meet her papa, armed with a double bass. Father and daughter conjure a musical manifestation of pure love with a stunning performance of ""Tonada De Ordeño [El Ordeñador]."" Though the traditional Venezuelan tune is a longtime favorite, this performance is different. A butterfly takes a seat on Silvana's mic and the camera zooms out to reveal the other instrumentalists in the workshop looking on in knowing admiration. Silvana's voice reverberates across the Veracruz hillside and the world exhales, basking in a fleeting moment of divinity on earth.

Anamaria Sayre | September 22, 2021
maye's sultry vocals and ethereal energy conjure a world in which areperias shrouded in hazy bubbles and twinkly lights feels astonishingly normal.

The enchanting pop singer fills her ""El Tiny"" home stage — the artist's favorite Venezuelan eatery in Miami — with family and friends, su propia gente. She opens with a short and simple rendition of the soon-to-be-released ""Maybe Baby"" before dropping her instrument and transitioning to an up-tempo, vocal-driven performance of ""Yours."" Picking the electric guitar back up, she strums along with a steady percussion and accompanying guitars for a soulful premiere of brand-new track ""Descifrar,"" emanating an understated and consistent confidence fitting for a pop reina on the rise. She closes out the set with a full-bodied execution of ""Tú,"" showcasing her signature tropicalia-meets-dream pop sound.

maye's effortless sashay from English to Spanish in her songs and speech represent an important facet of the El Tiny audience. Featuring a whole crew of Venezuelan-Americans, including her famous Latin singer-songwriter papá, Fernando Osorio on the traditional Venezuelan cuatro, the third performance in our Hispanic Heritage Month series authentically represents the experience of a family like maye's — one that exists in both planes, two worlds.

Given a moment and a platform like this, maye seizes the opportunity and creates an alternate universe, where barriers of culture and language dissolve and areperias sparkle.

4J5zTLnIqMY,Diamante Eléctrico: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month with an ""El Tiny"" takeover of the (home) concert series, featuring J Balvin, Camila Cabello and several more musicians from all corners of Latinidad. 

Reanna Cruz | September 17, 2021
Six hands, holding pencils as drumsticks, tap out a simple percussive beat on a Wurlitzer and two desks. Zooming out, the camera reveals the members of Diamante Eléctrico, accompanied by a colorful 10-piece backing ensemble in their home country's capital, Bogotá.

Diamante Eléctrico's brand of Colombian indie rock can be described in three words: funky, inventive and necessary. The Latin Grammy-winning band's music emphasizes community and place — two things that are displayed front and center as the band takes the stage in the second ""El Tiny"" performance of Hispanic Heritage Month.

""NO MIEDO!!!"" (no fear) and ""VERDAD"" (truth) adorn the worn-down desks as the collective powers through a politically-charged four-song set. Opening with 2018's ""Rotos,"" they breathe champeta life into their songs through horns and instruments like the guacharaca, played by singer Juan Galeano's brother Mario. They follow with ""Suéltame Bogotá,"" an upbeat plea to escape a suffocating home, and feature a spirited guest performance by Nicolai Fella of LosPetitFellas. ""Amalia"" leads into a genuine expression of thanks and solidarity, as Galeano gives gratitude to those protesting on ""primeras línea y segunda línea,"" shouting out the students and farmers challenging the government before finishing the set with ""A Veces.""

It's why Diamante Eléctrico has made themselves so crucial, not only in the Latin indie rock scene, but in music at large: the band's tether to its home country is substantial, no matter how fraught it may seem. Through both its music and stage presence, Diamante Eléctrico curates a shared sense of Latin roots and family, expanding outward from its home of Colombia and resonating across Latinidad, from Puerto Rico to Panama.

coMyNfnNBs4,J Balvin: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month with an ""El Tiny"" takeover of the (home) concert series, featuring J Balvin, Camila Cabello and several more musicians from all corners of Latinidad. 

Reanna Cruz | September 16, 2021
A tattooed hand scrawls on a small school desk — ""Jose by J Balvin"" — followed by a signature smile. It's an intimate beginning for the príncipe del reggaetón, J Balvin himself, as he begins his ""El Tiny"" performance on a sunny barge in the middle of the East River. Backed by the Brooklyn Bridge, Balvin breezes through some of the best cuts off of his new album JOSE (Balvin's birth name). The first three — ""Vestido,"" ""Que Locura"" and ""OTRO FILI"" — are moody and gentle popetón, creating expectations of familiar intimacy before he blows the performance wide open with the Tainy-produced, tempo-shifting album opener, ""F40."" And as the sun descends on the New York skyline, Balvin closes it out with a drop-laden extended mix of the jock-jam Skrillex collaboration, ""In Da Getto.""

To talk about modern Latin music is to talk about J Balvin. Over the course of the past 10 years, ""the boy from Medellín"" has risen from humble beginnings in Colombia to global superstardom, building an unprecedented fanbase at the intersection of pop, reggaetón, house and hip-hop, with over 18 billion views and 35 million record sales to prove it. He is the first Latino to headline Coachella and Lollapalooza, and there isn't a more fitting artist to kick off our month of ""El Tiny"" performances — Balvin is the epitome of cross-cultural success.

When a drone flies out during the last drop of ""In Da Getto,"" and we finally see the true scope of the barge that Balvin has been performing on, it serves as a reminder that no matter how personal his songs may be, Balvin will always, always, be massive.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world.

Abby O'Neill | Sept. 10, 2021
Flanked by an ensemble picked by music director, producer and longtime friend Denaun Porter, formidable lyricist Royce 5'9"" welcomes us to Heaven, his private studio near Detroit, for an impassioned Tiny Desk (home) concert. Donned in a white jumpsuit, an amped-up Royce points with enthusiasm toward vocalist Ashley Sorrell (his mentee and an emerging talent out of The D), who launches the set with ""God Speed” from Royce’s 2018 album, Book Of Ryan. 

Since his early years entrenched in emcee bootcamp alongside Detroit comrade Eminem, Royce -- a one-man army strapped with a battalion of bars -- has battled emcees ferociously (and playfully). Lately, Royce's personal growth -- as a man, a father and a husband -- has been palpable in his music, all while sharpening that proverbial verbal steel. The Grammy-nominated rapper aligned this Tiny Desk with National Recovery Month to celebrate his eighth year of sobriety. And in one touching moment between live renditions of ""Dead President Heads"" and the DJ Premier-produced classic ""Boom,"" Royce expresses his support for comedian Tony Baker, whose son was killed in August near Los Angeles. Royce’s lyrics and his band’s live instrumentation during this Tiny Desk combine for a reinvigorating adrenaline rush that pushes the artform forward.

2nFGD1-cmns,Pastor T.L. Barrett & the Royal Voices Of Life: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Mitra Arthur | September 9, 2021
Pastor T.L. Barrett comes to this Tiny Desk (home) concert from his spiritual home, the Chicago church he has pastored for over 40 years. His choir, the Royal Voices of Life, and the band are positioned in front of a dazzlingly lit stained glass window. A tambourine is at the ready. The sight is familiar to anyone familiar with churches that anchor their neighborhood.

Starting in 1971, Pastor Barrett released a series of albums that integrated soul and funk elements, all backed by a 45-member ensemble. Some of those former youths still perform with him today. At one point, his congregation included Donny Hathaway and members of Earth, Wind & Fire. Barrett's music has had a resurgence of late — his records have been sampled by Kanye West and DJ Khaled, songs have been featured in movies and commercials, and the label Numero Group will soon release a career-spanning box set.

Pastor Barrett opens this Tiny Desk (home) concert with ""I Shall Wear a Crown,"" reminding the choir, ""Let the people know you like it!"" His most well-known song, ""Like a Ship,"" retains the groove of the 1971 original; the song encourages that, despite the pain, you can shake it. In the rolling, soul-drenched take on ""Nobody Knows,"" Barrett cautions: ""This is a mean world to try to live in / But you've got to stay ahead until you die."" A church member sitting in the front pew, decked out in a wide brim hat, raises her hands in praise. This is not a concert; this is worship.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world.

Bobby Carter | September 8, 2021
As the camera slowly rises to the room, we see Yebba in the center of a circle, complete with band members, background singers and a string quartet. The room is part of Electric Lady Studios, where her debut album, Dawn, was recorded. The album bears the name of Yebba's mother, whom she tragically lost in 2016, and its songs find the Memphis native delving inward to process it all.

The singer is a bit of a live wire, rarely giving the same performance twice, and that's on display during most of this Tiny Desk (home) concert. The songs differ slightly or not so little compared to the studio sessions from Dawn, especially on the swelling interpretation of the lead single, ""Distance."" In between each song, Yebba shares unfocused and playful banter that just feels like she's family, and that feeling persists throughout this entire set, right down to the eye contact she shares with keyboardist and co-writer James Francies when speaking candidly about the final song, ""How Many Years.""

This Tiny Desk concert has been in the works since the spring of 2020, when the album was completed but shelved until Yebba (and the rest of the world) was in a better place. It was worth the wait.

z3ZFoo4-TdU,Rico Nasty: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Sidney Madden | September 3, 2021
""I like having a band,"" Rico Nasty says with a giggle midway through her Tiny Desk (home) concert. ""Especially when it's all girls.""

As an artist known to mash up the genres of rap, rock and pop — and create a safe space for women to do the same — Rico has rarely gotten the chance to put this full artistic collision on display. For her Tiny Desk debut, Rico takes every opportunity to flex her rage and range.

Dressed as if she's the main character out of a Tim Burton adaptation of Candyland, Rico bounces around her varied discography, never letting the audience get too comfortable with one sound. Starting off with one of her most recent cuts, the soft, surf rock-inspired ""Magic,"" the magnetic performer pulls a switch-up on viewers by jumping into some of her more raucous bangers, the type that would normally incite a sweaty mosh pit at her concerts. Of course, she closes the set with a shredding version of her breakout single, the primal scream mantra of ""Smack A Bitch."" The high-energy display evokes childlike joy and confection just as much as it does unapologetic savagery. ""I don't know where you at, where you watching this,"" Rico smirks at one point. ""You better break some s***.""

Since her early mixtape days all the way up to her 2020 debut album, Nightmare Vacation, Rico has waded in sonic dichotomy to blend her signature sound, deemed ""sugar trap,"" and in the process, became a beacon for women in rap to eloquently express their anger. As one of the DMV's most formidable forces, Rico always compels her fans to jump up, take charge and never apologize for what they feel.

It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bob Boilen | Sep. 1, 2021
Gathered in their kitchen are sisters, Emily, Jessica, and Camilla Staveley-Taylor; best known as The Staves. “We haven’t got a tiny desk; we’ve got our kitchen table.” But where The Staves gathered, along with guitarist and tenor horn player Marcus Hamblett, is deeply embedded in their family history. “We’re coming to you from Watford, England, in the house we grew up in and the table where we wrote most of our songs around. And we would road test every song in this kitchen, so we thought we’d play some songs for you from here.”

The four songs in this home concert all come from Good Woman, their first album in six years. It was produced with John Congleton (who’s previously worked with an ocean of artists, from St. Vincent to Nelly Furtado) and written after the passing of their mom and the birth of Emily’s first child. This stripped-down performance is a beautiful way to experience these sisters’ gorgeous harmonies through their songs of strength, loss, life and womanhood.

Nkt93coQzqg,Little Simz: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bobby Carter | August 31, 2021
A lot has happened since we last saw Little Simz at the Tiny Desk in 2017. Her stock as an actress has risen thanks to her role on the Drake-pushed reboot of Top Boy on Netflix; her 2019 album, Grey Area, made plenty of best-of-the-year lists, and the London native received the prestigious Pioneer Award at last year's AIM Awards.

For her Tiny Desk home concert Simz beamed to us from a more modest setting than all of that might imply: a living room, dropped inside a void. But it's an appropriate space for Simz to introduce her self-searching new album, Sometimes I Might Be Introvert. That arc is pulled together here by a proficient group of players interpreting the relaxed sound of producer Inflo (who is on a run like few in the game at the moment – see Sault and Cleo Sol.) They open with the pulsing military drum and grandiose keys of the record's title track, closing with the bounce and sway of ""Woman,"" dedicated to her mom. Between, a brutally honest message for her father, ""I Love You, I Hate You,"" and a premiere of the Afrobeat bop ""Point and Kill,"" featuring fellow London-based artist Obongjayar.

DIjOxmU6-ew,Migos: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

LaTesha Harris | August 25, 2021
By the time Quavo hits the second half of his opening verse on ""Avalanche,"" all three members of Migos are vibrating with energy, falling out of their seats to ride the beat. Juvenile delight fills the air, and it feels like a competition of who can vibe the hardest. Migos performs the remainder of their Tiny Desk (home) concert — ""Straightenin"" and ""Birthday"" — with Offset leaping around the trendy streetwear spot Gallery Dept., Quavo bouncing on armchairs and Takeoff working the shoulder.

Their performance showcases why we first fell in love with the Atlanta trap trio: charismatic synchronization, playful braggadocio and, of course, their exhilarating resurrection of the triplet flow. In 2013, Migos released the breakout single ""Versace"" before grinding their way up to 2015's Yung Rich Nation. In 2017, Migos firmly pulled everyone and their mama into their orbit; Culture, especially its inescapable lead single, ""Bad and Boujee,"" laid the foundation for contemporary rap's reckoning. Culture II dropped a year later, and the trilogy concluded with Culture III, released this past June. Legendary producer collective 1500 or Nothin' bring the best part of the new album to life in this long-waited Tiny Desk, as Larrance ""Rance"" Dopson, Lamar ""My Guy Mars"" Edwards, Quintin ""Q"" Gulledge and Chris Payton — as well as Migos mainstay DJ Durel — deliver chest-thudding support.

""You rockin' with the greatest group of all time,"" Quavo announces toward the end of their performance and, as the surreal party plays out, it's tempting to agree. Simply put: They ate and left no crumbs.

Ea9_egtJYMg,Joy Oladokun: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Nikki Birch | August 20, 2021
Clad in a denim jacket, Joy Oladokun shines a light on the subjects of grief, politics and life in America via the lens of someone who looks and loves differently. Standing firmly in her vulnerability, the first-generation Nigerian American opens her studio performance with ""if you got a problem,"" a sweet ballad that pledges unconditional friendship through the lonely and the messy times. After a charming introduction, she picks up her guitar and begins ""taking the heat,"" which she dedicates to the late Mac Miller. The song examines the way we, as consumers, treat the artists who create the music that resonates with us: ""Does anybody ever wonder when the legends die young / If there's anything we could have done...""

Oladokun's songwriting is brutally honest, yet inviting, as she fearlessly tackles tough topics. Musically, her folk-soul vibe is reminiscent of other great storytellers: Sam Cooke, John Lennon, Tracy Chapman. After cautioning us that we're strapped in for a ""deep dive into my mental health, or lack thereof,"" Oladokun continues to lance festering boils in ""i see america,"" a melancholic and optimistic exploration written as a response to the low value placed on American lives, be they Black or other. This Tiny Desk (home) concert concludes with ""sunday,"" a tale of identity crisis: ""Bury me under the weight of who you need me to be."" While the theme is heavy, the delivery is uplifting, once again demonstrating how Oladokun's penetrating gaze into the human psyche yields beautiful storytelling in spite of the pain that surely inspired it.

uQvdcfosF5A,The Isley Brothers: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bobby Carter | Aug. 18, 2021
Before the Isley Brothers played ""That Lady"" during this Tiny Desk (at Home) concert, lead singer and founding member Ronald Isley shared two stories about the song that perfectly encapsulates the scope of their nearly seven-decade career. ""It reminds me of going way back, when we had Jimi Hendrix living at the house and playing. We went on to meet a young fellow by the name of Kendrick Lamar who sampled the record and we got a Grammy award for it."" At the Tiny Desk, we've hosted shows from superstars and legends – but our home concert series has now officially reached new heights.

Shot at their home studio in St. Louis, Mo., Ronald and his brother Ernie stand front and center, performing just a slice from a catalog overstuffed with classic anthems. (These four songs alone have been sampled or covered by over three hundred artists.) They kick things off with 1983's quiet storm essential, ""Between the Sheets."" As a nod to the late Notorious B.I.G., Mr. Biggs opens with, ""I like it when you call me Big Poppa"" – from there, they fire off three more hits, including the immortal ""Footsteps in the Dark"" and ""For the Love of You."" The Isley Brothers have eclipsed legendary status – their music is an intrinsic, indelible part of American culture. Watching Ron and Ernie play with as much enthusiasm as they did 30, 40, 50 years ago is an awe-inspiring sight to cherish.

pF2ga0O2dN4,Flock of Dimes: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future.

It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Stephen Thompson | Aug, 10, 2021
Flock of Dimes may be a ""solo"" project for Wye Oak's Jenn Wasner, but she couldn't pass up an opportunity to invite a few friends over. You'll spot their familiar faces all over this video: Mountain Man's Amelia Randall Meath, Molly Sarlé and Alexandra Sauser-Monnig, percussionist Matthew McCaughan from Bon Iver... you even get full attendance from Sylvan Esso, given that Meath is seated alongside her partner Nick Sanborn. (He doesn't play in the set, but he did co-produce Flock of Dimes' latest album, so Wasner asked him to sit in and bring a book to read.)

The result is a communal set — filmed at Sylvan Esso's new studio in Durham, N.C., called Betty's — that doesn't merely re-create three of the songs from this year's Head of Roses. These acoustic performances actually shed new light, thanks to radiant and radically different arrangements, while fully capturing the warmth we look for from Tiny Desk concerts. (Plus, with nine people in the frame, it's a cast large enough that when they clap between songs, they almost sound like a crowd.)

5VHlrsZbgBI,Ben Howard: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bob Boilen | August 9, 2021
Having spent time with Collections from the Whiteout, Ben Howard's sonically adventurous fourth album, I was curious to see how he would adapt these songs to the Tiny Desk (home) concert format. So when the opening shot shows Ben in a room alone, an acoustic guitar in hand, it was both an ""oh yeah!"" and an ""uh-oh"" moment. Gone were all those textures that he, Aaron Dessner, and a load of talented musicians had worked on, but front and center was that delicate, reflective voice that I love. It's a voice that, in the recent past, was often swarming in effects and buried in reverb.

So as Ben Howard opens his Tiny Desk with the album's opening track, I found myself zeroing in on the oblique and painterly images of ""Follies Fixtures"": ""Walk with me to the burning spire. / We can count the dеad on Ender's pyre. / The dusty towns whеre the number's found / Don't quite match the missing."" He later premieres a new tune, ""Oldest Trick In The Book.""

""Thanks for having me and allowing me to play the slight variations of songs that I'm forced to settle with at the moment,"" Ben says, and with that he kicks on the drum machine and plays the music that drew me to his work in 2021. Watch those fingers on the guitar and hear that tone. ""Far Out,"" indeed.

eCK1QnrTXvA,Hiatus Kaiyote: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future.

It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Abby O'Neill | August 4, 2021
Melbourne alt-soul collective Hiatus Kaiyote tricked out its avant-garde recording studio, The Villa, and lathered it with props: a miniature desk, alien costumes, and loads of furry friends. Frontwoman Nai Palm shared with me the impetus behind the design. ""I'm a treasure hunter at heart,"" she said, ""and the beautiful thing about dressing a set with sentimental artifacts from my house is that I feel super comfy to perform."" Every intricate detail of this Tiny Desk (home) concert evokes feelings of coziness, psychedelia and joyful performance art.

Launching into this brilliant performance with ""Sip Into Something Soft,"" Hiatus takes us on a sweet and sultry journey through a host of selections from their new album, Mood Valiant. On ""Rose Water,"" the tightness of the band (comprised of Paul Bender, Simon Mavin and Perrin Moss, and joined by their longtime backing vocalists) is on full display.

Hiatus Kaiyote came onto the scene with their debut album, Tawk Tomahawk, back in 2012 and created a groundswell of buzz among global music heads. Since then, they've gone on to win varying international awards and were the first Australian group to get nominated in the R&B category at the Grammys for best R&B performance in 2013. This uber-fun and exhilarating set will appease diehards and new fans alike.

MxbGf_JyvVs,Dinosaur Jr.: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Stephen Thompson | Aug. 3, 2021
In the year-plus that we’ve been recording Tiny Desk (home) concerts, artists have worked hard to reproduce the Tiny Desk vibe through special effects ranging from Phoebe Bridgers’ Oval Office backdrop to clipping.’s tininess-enhancing miniature set. For Dinosaur Jr., the spirit of the Tiny Desk can be found in an under-appreciated facet of the series: the ever-evolving array of tchotchkes, promo pieces and other bits of pop-cultural detritus that line the shelves behind Bob Boilen’s desk.

Dinosaur Jr.’s own home concert — “home” in this case being the stage of an empty Shea Theater in Turners Falls, Mass. — is set amid its own enviable assortment of oddities, from stuffed animals to a Mork action figure to a copy of the album A Christmas Together by John Denver & The Muppets. And you don’t stick around as a band for all or part of five decades without knowing a little something about product placement: Dinosaur Jr.’s terrific new album, Sweep It Into Space, is prominently located near the wee plastic desk that sits front and center onstage.

Naturally, that album dominates this five-song set, which finds the trio of singer-guitarist J Mascis, singer-bassist Lou Barlow and drummer Murph sounding as fluid and forceful and gnarly as ever. Mascis gets to unleash a few shredding solos, Barlow gets to take the lead in “Garden” and Murph gets to do his thing in close proximity to a pair of large dinosaur-shaped balloons. Plus, longtime fans get treated to two towering classics from earlier in Dinosaur Jr.’s excellent career: “Feel the Pain,” from 1994’s Without a Sound, and “Freak Scene,” which opens 1988’s Bug.

Bob Boilen | July 30, 2021
The first time I saw shame singer Charlie Steen, he was stripped down to nothing but his Racing Green brand underwear (which he had wedged up his behind), as guitar, bass and drums punctuated his emphatic vocals. In this Tiny Desk (home) concert, we find Charlie in a full suit, tie and hat, sitting in a living room atmosphere backed not only by the rest of shame (also seated), but a compendium of violins, horns and more.

All the songs here are from the band's 2021 album, Drunk Tank Pink. It's the sound of this South London post-punk band challenging not only their listeners, but themselves. What a thrill.

6uMyPRYjIYw,Anna B Savage: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Tom Huizenga | July 28, 2021
Anna B Savage's new home these days is the west coast of Ireland near Mullaghmore, where this striking video was shot. Moss clings to a shoreline cove where seagulls circle in air so moist you could slice right through it.

Savage's songs, too, are thick with unfiltered feelings, self-interrogation and wry humor, raising the bar for any Joni Mitchell-inspired confessional songwriting. The three she performs here are pulled from different moments in her career and personal life but cohere around the theme of struggling in the darkness of a toxic relationship before emerging into self-confident sunshine. The songs might be self-referential, but like Mitchell's they speak in customized messages with a voice that whispers intimacies one moment and soars with operatic glory the next.

In ""Corncrakes,"" Savage's beloved birds trigger mixed feelings for a lover, climaxing in the repeated line that itself could have been our collective mantra over the past year: ""I don't know if this is even real. I don't feel things as keenly as I used to.""

""Since We Broke Up,"" a new song premiered here, finds Savage rising from personal struggles to once again enjoy her own company, while the astounding ""One,"" from her 2015 breakthrough EP, paints a painful bedroom scene of self-doubt and embarrassment that ultimately leads to an explosive epiphany.

Enamored of her new environs, Savage told NPR she chose the locale to ""showcase some of my new, completely wild and amazing landscape."" But what she truly offers here is the terrain inside the mind of one of today's most distinctive cartographers of human temperament.

SAROJPnd_s8,Young Thug: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Sidney Madden | July 27, 2021
Young Thug looks right at home in the lush, almost regal, gardens of The Houdini Estate in Los Angeles. The serenity of the chosen location might seem too delicate for the punk-rock raps Thug and his crew reverberate through the grounds, but as hip-hop's impactful oddball, oxymoronic magic has always been his strong suit.

For the last decade, the world of rap has lived, learned and been liberated while under the influence of Young Thug. His contorted cadence, visionary fashion sense and freaky, frantic wordplay have inspired an entire generation of artists to no end. And now, the Atlanta iconoclast is evolving yet again. Not only is he wading through the waters of punk with his forthcoming album, Punk — Thug is using his Tiny Desk debut to usher in his next era, one that's meant to represent ""authenticity, consciousness and overall purity."" Premiering songs off his long-teased album (due out Oct. 15), the Grammy winner's rhymes slither along smoothly no matter how rough the music, taking fans on a journey of energy and emotion.

""I'm just seeking for God's soul 'cause I know something's missing,"" a peach-haired Thug admits on his opener, ""Die Slow,"" before divulging specific hardships that shape his music. It's a small sample of the tests in life that inspire lines like, ""You gotta go through this s*** with your heart / You can't snooze on it"" and prompt him to celebrate even the smallest wins with VVS diamonds and exotic vacations. By the time the sun sets and the crew is joined by famed drummer Travis Barker for a fresh rendition of the chart-topping ""Ski,"" the surge of triumphant excitement is almost too much for him to contain. But then again, why would he want to?

yN0I5xTjaGo,Vince Staples: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bobby Carter | July 23, 2021
At the midpoint of Vince Staples' Tiny Desk (home) concert, he gazes through the sun-soaked windows of his Hollywood Hills location and pauses. ""You should see this view – I don't live here,"" he exclaims with pride. ""I would never live here."" As to why he wouldn't give in to the spoils of success and relocate to a fancy spot in the Hills or Calabasas, he explains in the lyrics of the song that follows, ""THE SHINING"": I could never do it / I'm too active. That sentiment, the push-pull relationship with his North Long Beach home base, is a dominant theme of his new self-titled album, which he tells NPR is ""the clearest expression yet of who he is.""

Despite years-long demand from our audience on YouTube, this was the perfect time for a Vince Staples Tiny Desk performance. We've very rarely seen him perform with a band in the past. Then there's the sound of his new work – Kenny Beats, seen playing bass, handled the bulk of the production of the album, Staples' most melodic to date. The band, outfitted in blue khaki suits, was able to recreate the sound of Vince Staples seamlessly (it's mostly made up of players from the album), and coast wonderfully through this four-song set, punctuated by Vince's signature, tongue-in-cheek humor between songs. Always willing to share the spotlight with future stars (see Snoh Aalegra), he closes with the assistance of another on the horizon, the singer Fousheé, on ""TAKE ME HOME.""

DHvPWoMeDtE,Maple Glider: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bob Boilen | July 21, 2021
Tori Zietsch, aka Maple Glider, is in her Australian home surrounded by her bandmates and friends. Comforting landscape paintings cover the walls: Tori's first vinyl album, Melanie's 1971 album Gather Me, hangs alongside the pictures. She fingerpicks her guitar and sings ""Mama It's Christmas,"" the closing track to her debut album, To Enjoy Is the Only Thing. As she sings the words: ""Oh it's Christmas time again / Where is my brother / Where is my friend / Mama it's Christmas time, again / Doesn't he know I've got ribbons to wrap him in."" Looking at the camera's wide shot, I sense her watching bandmates and those landscape paintings morph into a warm, comforting blanket.

Tori grew up steeped — and trapped — in a restrictive, religious home. Music was her way out. She was part of a duo known as Seavera, and when that disbanded, she moved to Brighton in the U.K. She wrote a stockpile of solo music and came back to Melbourne with what she describes as a SoundCloud packed with demo tunes. I first became enchanted by the second song here, ""As Tradition."" It's the first single she put out as Maple Glider, and it speaks to the loss of identity in both relationships and religion. On the lighter side, she refers to her talented band as ""The Yeeehawwws"" because they sing ultra country versions of her songs during rehearsals. There may come a time when levity becomes part of Maple Glider; for now, these heavy tunes, packed with thoughtful words and sung so longingly, are here to enjoy.

p6Fj-Uq6Q4s,The Weather Station: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bob Boilen | July 20, 2021
There's a desk and a band playing songs filled with nature's imagery somewhere in the woods of Mulmur in Southern Ontario, Canada. It's the perfect setting for The Weather Station. Outdoor locations are familiar to anyone who's seen recent videos for ""Robber,"" ""Parking Lot,"" ""Tried to Tell You"" and ""Atlantic,"" all songs from the band's fourth album, Ignorance, and all songs performed here for its Tiny Desk (home) concert. Songwriter and singer Tamara Lindeman told NPR Music's Marissa Lorusso of her deep feelings on the climate crisis: ""I just basically fell down the rabbit hole that happens to you when you take in the full reality of what it means, and what two degrees [of warming] means and how far over the cliff we already are."" And so the songs for this Tiny Desk (home) concert are filled with imagery of nature and our relationship with our planet.

With images of a blood-red sunset in the song ""Atlantic"" and the lines ""Thinking I should get all this dying off of my mind / I should really know better than to read the headlines / Does it matter if I see it? / No, really, can I not just cover my eyes?,"" Tamara writes about her passion for the earth and its future, but the tunes are calming and thoughtful, not doctrines or lectures. This big band with two drummers, two guitars, keyboards and a sax seems at home in the great outdoors. I, however, look forward to seeing them in a club again when their tour begins in September.

-4FyRybGiBc,Lucy Dacus: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bob Boilen | July 15, 2021
Lucy Dacus sits at a very special desk for this Tiny Desk (home) concert. And though she's played the NPR Tiny Desk twice — first in 2016 and a few years later with Julien Baker and Phoebe Bridgers as boygenius — the desk at Maggie L. Walker Governor's School likely holds deeper memories. Much of her third album, Home Video, is centered on her school years in Richmond, Va., and the friendships formed and shattered there. During those high school years, she met her musical mate, guitarist Jacob Blizard (seated on the right side of the screen), and the audio engineer capturing all these songs, Collin Pastore.

Lucy Dacus opens with ""Brando,"" a song about young adulthood, and for Lucy, understanding how others perceive her. ""You called me cerebral,"" she sings, ""I didn't know what that meant."" She and her band play ""VBS,"" which Lucy explains ""means vacation bible school, for all you heathen folks."" It's Lucy, as a young Christian, thinking about her faith. Then, four acoustic guitars gather for ""Going Going Gone,"" as Ricardo Lagomasino moves from the drum kit and Dominic Angelella puts down his bass. Sarah Goldstone helms the keyboards. For the final tune, the band vanishes as Lucy plays the most troubling song from Home Video, ""Thumbs,"" a song where Lucy fantasizes about murdering a friend's estranged father. It's a tune I often find too disturbing to listen to. But it's also an example of why artists create — to deal with profound issues. When successful (and ""Thumbs"" certainly is), these types of songs can move writers and listeners to think hard and understand.

It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Lyndsey McKenna | July 12, 2021
Both as producer extraordinaire and artist in his own right, Jack Antonoff has had an outsized impact on the past decade in pop. And yet, even with such maximalist aims, Antonoff clearly understands the effectiveness of scale: that the most enduring tracks are often intimate portraits.

Recorded in a sun-drenched spot outside Electric Lady Studios, where the forthcoming Take the Sadness Out of Saturday Night was made, Bleachers' Tiny Desk (home) concert puts a premium on proximity, both emotionally and spatially. Surrounded by greenery, the footage is interspersed with close-up angles filtered through an old-school finish (scan the wide shot and you'll spy a video camera perched on the piano, plus one very tiny desk, too). The set opens with ""91,"" the album's ambitious opening cut, followed by a bombastic revision of ""Stop Making This Hurt,"" which gets a slick saxophone rewrite courtesy of Zem Audu and Evan Smith.

Just before the concert concludes with a sweeping rendition of ""Chinatown"" – no Bruce Springsteen cameo, but the emotional ache remains – Antonoff explains the urgency of the recording process: ""We did a bunch of live takes that sound to me like a group of people who didn't know if they were ever gonna play again, and that became the backbone of this album."" The stakes feel high when the tracks feel personal: It's a balancing act at which Antonoff excels.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bob Boilen | July 9, 2021
I don't think I've ever used the word ""fierce"" to describe a Tiny Desk, but that's precisely what JAMBINAI has created in this (home) concert. The show begins in front of a massive recreation of my desk and what happens next ... well, no spoilers here. Filmed in an immersive media art museum created by an organization known as d'strict on Jeju Island, this Korean band contains multitudes. At its heart, JAMBINAI's music mixes elements of metal, noise and Korean tradition. There's full-on distorted guitar, bass and drums, but also a haegeum (a fiddle-like instrument), a piri (a type of flute), a taepyeongso (a reed instrument) and a most appropriately named instrument, a geomungo (a giant Korean zither). We also hear some delicate vocals in the mix.

The two pieces performed here include 2015's ""Time of Extinction"" and the more recent and epic ""ONDA."" I last saw JAMBINAI on two consecutive nights at SXSW in 2014 and then again at the 2021 virtual festival. It reminded me of their intensity and originality, and I look forward to the day when they come and play a more modest, tinier desk and, perhaps, shake the shelves.

It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Abby O'Neill | July 8, 2021
Black Motion's Tiny Desk (home) concert, recorded at the former residence of Nelson Mandela, feels like a spiritual sound bath. The South African production duo turntablist Bongani Mohosana of the Zulu tribe and percussionist Thabo Mabogwane of Sotho tribe — open their set with ""Mayibuye iAfrica,"" a cry for Africa to return to its culture and history.

This Afro-House set is brought to life thanks to several featured vocalists and guest musicians. Afro-House has spread joy and healing across the country of South Africa, transcending local boundaries to become a thriving global dance phenomenon. In my experience, Its indigenous sounds and percussive rhythms drench the soul and heart with healing powers and cultivate communion with the infinite.

South African singer Msaki makes her third appearance in our (home) concert series, after earlier credits with Black Coffee and our Coming 2 America special. She lends her vocals to ""Marry Me,"" a soulful jam from Black Motion's 2020 album, The Healers: The Last Chapter. ""Imali,"" featuring Nokwazi, soothes the lingering remnants of pandemic fears, while Tabia closes with the lilting ""Prayer for Rain.""

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Lars Gotrich | July 6, 2021
Up until now, Dry Cleaning's post-Brexit post-punk relied on a robust dynamism of jagged, thudding lushness and a speak-song voice. It's music that coos and quizzes at once. How energizing to hear Dry Cleaning recontextualize its established sound for a relatively subdued Tiny Desk performance from World of Echo, a record store in East London beloved to the British band.

Surrounded by tapes and vinyl — and framed by posters of Wipers and The Fall — the four members look cozy in the small space. Tom Dowse trades his effects pedals and electric guitar for an acoustic; its weird bends and weirder chords surprisingly complement the atmospheric keyboards and minimal beats of Nick Buxton, who's normally on drums. Lewis Maynard's bass doesn't throttle at this volume, but still grooves.

The bedroom-quiet arrangements of songs from its latest album, New Long Leg (plus ""Viking Hair"" from a previous EP), allows Florence Shaw's voice, an instrument of resolute deadpan, to bloom. Some might call her delivery wry, even disaffected — her lyrics non-sequitur — but here a sly inquisitiveness inclines a smile (""I'd like to run away with you on a plane, but don't bring those loafers"") and burns a harsh memory (""Never talk about your ex / Never, never, never, never, never slag them off / Because then they know""). If Dry Cleaning's records are labyrinths of pulsing sound and droll poetry, think of this Tiny Desk (home) concert as the narrow path that lays bare the band's gnarled roots.

emPobfT6kOk,Sleater-Kinney: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Jacob Ganz | July 1, 2021
You don't have to wait long for a signature Sleater-Kinney moment in the band's Tiny Desk (home) concert. Over the first half of the title track to Path of Wellness, Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein sing of human frailty and self-improvement, vibrating with low notes of disgust. Then Brownstein shoots Tucker a knowing smile as they sing, ""You could never love me enough,"" and the pair, who have been making music together for nearly 30 years, start to unwind things: Brownstein hisses ""I am on a path of wellness"" through gritted teeth before ripping into a four-note riff that feels like it's pulling your guts out; Tucker sets her voice at maybe 75 percent howl capacity to sing ""I feel like I'm unknown"" and Brownstein still has to raise a hand to steady herself against the force. She can't stop grinning.

Tension is the heart of Sleater-Kinney's untouchable catalog, and Brownstein and Tucker know how to add layers to keep a song's meaning shifting. They recorded Path of Wellness at Halfling Studio in Portland in the midst of pandemic and protest, and returned to make this Tiny Desk. ""High In The Grass"" feels looser and hazier than on the album; ""Worry With You"" feels heavier. A treat for fans from the band's first decade: ""One Beat"" played with piano and bowed upright bass, making it that much easier to hear how, by the end, Tucker's pleas and Brownstein's yelp have been inextricably knitted together. Untangling things would be missing the point.

sLFDCyqqBsQ,From The Top: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Tom Huizenga | June 30, 2021
It's been said that our young people are the hope of our future. If that's true, the future of classical music looks blazingly bright, judging from these extraordinary performances by the young musicians in this triple-play Tiny Desk (home) concert.

Teenagers from three locales around the country – Chicago, St. Louis and Palo Alto, Calif. – invite us into their homes for fresh takes on vintage classics, contemporary sounds and sophisticated pop arrangements. They are all alums of From the Top, the radio program (distributed by NPR) that spotlights today's terrific young players.

Ifetayo Ali-Landing, an outstanding 18-year-old cellist from Chicago starts us off. She's already performed with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and given her own TEDx talk. One of her calling cards is this propulsive performance of ""Evergreen,"" a pop song by Yebba, arranged for solo cello.

Pairing up in Palo Alto, the Davisson Guitar Duo features Jack, 16, and his sister Elle, 13. Their signature piece is the rhythmically driven Jongo, which offers flavors from composer Paulo Bellinati's native Brazil. The siblings finish each other's musical phrases with startling lyrical precision.

Seventh-grader Jerry Chang, clad in his comfy exercise shorts, closes this cross-country Tiny Desk from home, playing Schubert's G-flat major Impromptu like someone twice his age. The gentle, rippling effects he gets from his still-growing 13-year-old hands, and the way he makes Schubert's wistful melody sing, is astonishing.

These Tiny Desk performances alone are proof enough that classical music in America is alive and in very talented hands.

SET LIST
Yebba: ""Evergreen"" (arr. Charles Yang)
Paulo Bellinati: Jongo
Franz Schubert: ""Impromptu Op. 90, No. 3""

The Tiny Desk managed to stay nimble during the COVID-19 pandemic thanks to our (home) concert series and the musicians who were determined to make moves in quarantine. Creative souls found myriad ways to get their art to the masses via live streams and social media while also conjuring new ways to collaborate and connect to audiences. Over the past year and some change, beatmakers Carrtoons, Kaelin Ellis, Kiefer, and The Kount took to social media individually and often collaboratively to cook up productions, often resulting in viral moments and never-seen-before glimpses into their creative process. 
As we continue to celebrate 50 years of NPR, Tiny Desk was determined to take part. To honor the iconic themes from our news programs, we asked these four producers to come up with their own spin on the All Things Considered theme (written by Don Voegeli) the Morning Edition theme and the theme for Weekend Edition (both written by B.J. Leiderman).

R9gdI7TbLY0,Mahani Teave: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Tom Huizenga | June 24, 2021
Our Tiny Desk (home) concerts have visited many faraway places – from Lang Lang in China to Mdou Moctar in Niger – but none as far-flung as Easter Island. The 63-square-mile isle, called Rapa Nui by its residents, is located some 2,000 miles off the coast of Chile.

And yes, classical music thrives there – thanks largely to Mahani Teave, the pianist who offers this engaging performance from the music school she co-founded. As a child, Teave saw the first piano brought to the island in 1992 and dreamed of becoming a world-class concert pianist. It was a dream she fulfilled, but just as she was poised to launch her international career, an even stronger dream tugged at her heart.

In 2014, she broke ground on the Toki School of Music, aiming to teach traditional and classical music to Easter Island's children. Constructed from over 2,500 used tires and 60,000 cans and bottles, the building, with its cisterns and solar power, is a testament to Teave's vision for sustainability.

Even the straight-back yellow chair Teave uses as a piano bench in this performance seems repurposed from her kitchen. She begins with a sparkling Allemande by Handel, followed by a beguiling performance of a Chopin Nocturne. Teave closes with an ancestral song , featuring sisters Eva and Tama Tucki Dreyer. The story follows Rapa Nui's first king, whose reign coincided with a natural disaster. It's a metaphor, Teave says, for our planet, to ""leave this place a little bit better than how we found it."" With her fine playing and her music school, Teave has done exactly that.

SET LIST
George Frideric Handel: ""Suite No. 5 in E, II. Allemande""
Frédéric Chopin: ""Nocturne in B-flat minor, Op. 9, No. 1""

NOG49BTdJLQ,Liz Phair: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Robin Hilton | June 23, 2021
Liz Phair's music was always meant to fill arenas. After a clever sleight-of-hand at the top of this Tiny Desk (home) performance, where it briefly seems we've returned to in-person sets behind Bob Boilen's desk, Phair and her backing band do their best to recreate the kind of set you'd see in a much larger space; everyone plugs-in, turns it up and rocks with an impressive light show.

Phair highlights three tracks from Soberish, her first new album in more than a decade, and the most reflective and beautiful record she's made. She starts with ""Spanish Doors,"" a heartbreaking but hooky portrait of a marriage nearing its end. She follows with a song against loneliness called ""In There,"" followed by ""The Game,"" a meditation on the mind games that sabotage troubled relationships.

Nearly 30 years after her stunning debut, Exile In Guyville, Liz Phair's sound shines and shakes as much as it ever did – the ringing guitars, her deadpan delivery, the tight harmonies. But the themes have evolved from youthful defiance and indiscretions to wiser ruminations on the complications of growing older.

But Phair still finds joy and a playful sense of humor in her earliest work, closing her Tiny Desk with a generous version of ""Never Said,"" from Exile. ""Put your way-way-back hat on,"" she says as the band kicks in. When it's all over she asks for ""tiny clapping for the Tiny Desk... ...We enjoyed almost being there.""

AKK5FV6zPkY,"Jack Ingram, Miranda Lambert, Jon Randall: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert","The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Lyndsey McKenna | June 21, 2021
The trio of country superstar Miranda Lambert, long-tenured recording artist Jack Ingram and acclaimed songwriter-producer Jon Randall have history together: After collaborating on ""Tin Man"" from Lambert's 2016 record The Weight Of These Wings and ""Tequila Does"" from 2019's Wildcard, the artists spent five days last November recording in Marfa, Texas. In this (home) concert, the trio turns its quarantine album, The Marfa Tapes, into a quarantine Tiny Desk set, complete with a well-appointed desk in the corner of the frame.

The Marfa Tapes was largely recorded outdoors with just a few mics and guitars, and that intimacy at the heart of these songs remains present under the bright lights and against the dark wooden palette panelling of this session. The set opens with a one-two gut punch of ""Waxahachie"" followed by ""Tin Man."" (""Our award-winning song,"" Lambert jokes. The track won the 2018 Academy of Country Music Award for song of the year.) At its conclusion, Lambert lets out a laugh and the trio exchange knowing glances before finishing the show with ""In His Arms.""

Throughout the set, there's clear chemistry and camaraderie, evident in the ease on display between songs (""I like that,"" Lambert says as they conclude the first track. ""I love it,"" Ingram one-ups.) Even if we can't all make it to Marfa for a songwriting session, a (home) concert feels like an honorary invitation to Ingram, Lambert and Randall's world.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Nikki Birch | June 17, 2021
The studio backdrop of this Tiny Desk (home) concert is the perfect setting for the dynamic duo headlining this project. Pino Palladino is a prolific bassist whose sound you're already intimately acquainted with (even if you don't know it). Blake Mills, a guitarist and two-time Grammy nominee for producer of the year, has an impressive catalog of his own. Together, in the studio, the topshelf sidemen are in their element, distilling the sonic creativity that is the first release under Palladino's name, Notes With Attachments.

Eight pulsing calls from saxophonist Sam Gendel usher us into ""Just Wrong"" a melodic meditation that unfolds like a blossom in timelapse. Guitar, bass, sax and Abe Rounds' colorful dustings of percussion in this song are magical; we soar with the musicians through varied repetitions of the melody before they gently set us back on our feet. The afterimage of our flight is still fading away when Palladino greets the viewers with a short and sweet introduction before opening ""Ekuté,"" a tune that explores traditional West African music, jazz and rock influences with a few modern touches of technology. ""Djurkel,"" the final offering in this set, is also experimental in nature. Palladino's trademark bass sound lies in the cut, the fertile ground on which Mills, Gendel and Rounds dance dreamily around each other. This is session musicianship at its best. Each watch reveals new depths to the mastery.

wp7qctyVU2s,Men I Trust: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bobby Carter | June 16, 2021
From a rustic and retro-looking cabin on the north shore of the St. Lawrence River in Quebec, the band Men I Trust seized the essence of the Tiny Desk almost to a tee. The controlled, yet layered four-song set, bookended by tracks from 2019's Oncle Jazz would almost certainly make for a plug-and-play situation had it been behind Bob Boilen's desk.

Men I Trust was initially the duo of high school friends Dragos Chiriac and Jessy Caron, before adding vocalist Emma Proulx in 2015 and recording the group's debut album, Headroom. (They expanded to a quintet for this performance, with Cedric Martel handling bass and Eric Maillet on drums.) The song ""Humming Man,"" performed here, was its first official single as a trio and they never looked back from there. The band's style sways between rubbery upbeat electro-pop and the muddy pace evident on last year's ""Lucky Sue,"" but generally hits that sweet spot for anybody looking to be cradled and carried by a vibe-y groove. The overdubs and reverb on Emma's vocals are stripped away here, leaving a deceptively endearing quality to her voice. The band told NPR that this set was one of its first times playing together after a long hiatus due to the COVID-19 lockdown. ""We reunited at the cabin, jammed and recorded our session,"" the members said via email. ""We strived to capture the intimacy and coziness on sound and image. We hope you'll enjoy it!""

HObS9FWpTNI,Joseph Keckler: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Marissa Lorusso | June 14, 2021
""My love called me many names,"" Joseph Keckler sings in ""GPS Song,"" which opens his Tiny Desk (home) concert. He proceeds to list them: ""Baby animal. Little baby animal. Big baby animal. Black chicken."" (It goes on like this for some time.)

""GPS Song"" — which is sung partly in a made-up language and evolves to feature the titular navigation system droning in the background of a breakup — is one of Keckler's hallmark absurdist arias, which he performs with a commanding presence and a winking, deadpan delivery. While their content is quirky (another features the narrator's relapse into a teenage goth identity), it's not quite right to call them strictly funny; they're infused with a kind of intimate, observational detail that makes them simultaneously comedic and affecting. (""It was the most heartbreaking moment of my life,"" Keckler once said of the situation that inspired ""GPS Song,"" ""yet it was also so ridiculous to have this disrupting automaton, breaking our silence to misdirect us at every moment."" This performance captures that ridiculousness and heartbreak equally.)

A classically trained singer, performance artist and writer whose work spans styles and genres, Keckler turns his Tiny Desk (home) concert, shot in Brooklyn, into a showcase of his dynamism as a performer. Here, he also performs two other original songs — ""City"" and ""Appearances"" — that, while less absurd, are no less striking, displaying the incredible range and expressiveness of his powerful voice.

eHod4ZPzfLc,Merry Clayton: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Lauren Onkey  | June 9, 2021
Merry Clayton's Tiny Desk concert begins with the essentials. After a brief piano intro, she begins to sing ""Beautiful Scars"" — the title track of her new album — in a powerful and knowing voice. That simple pairing commands attention: ""I've been on the battlefield of life. / I've been through it. / But I just had to go through that to get to this."" She sings in dialogue with five superb singers, all with serious gospel chops — including members of The Waters and Take 6 — and a band of seasoned pros. ""Stand up and be proud of your scars,"" she sings. The vibe is relaxed, but purposeful.

This performance is an inspiring comeback for Clayton, who has been making great music for almost 60 years. Clayton is one of rock's most important backup singers (for starters, see The Rolling Stones' ""Gimme Shelter,"" Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""Sweet Home Alabama"" and Carole King's Tapestry). She recorded several excellent solo albums that never broke big, but eventually received the recognition she deserved in the 2013 documentary 20 Feet From Stardom. In 2014, she was in a serious car accident that required months in the hospital and extensive rehabilitation. With encouragement from her longtime friend and producer Lou Adler — who's watching this performance off-camera — she decided to record a new album.

All the songs in this Tiny Desk performance testify to the power of faith and friendship. ""Oh What a Friend,"" written by Terry Young, features soaring call-and-response vocals between Clayton and the vocalists. They conclude with a stirring and joyous version of Sam Cooke's 1956 classic ""Touch the Hem of His Garment.""

Robin Hilton | June 8, 2021
My great-grandmother always used to say, ""Life is a train. People get on. People get off."" And it just keeps going. Watching Rostam's Tiny Desk performance, it's easy to imagine you're on that life-train, traveling around and around, catching glimpses of instruments and faces as they pass by, before coming back where you started. It's a clever, if sometimes dizzying nod to the overarching themes of Rostam's Changephobia, a collection of songs that simultaneously look to the past and the future.

Rostam and a group of backing musicians play two cuts from that album: the relatively breezy, escapist ballad ""4Runner"" and the reflective ""These Kids We Knew."" The group closes with ""In a River,"" a one-off single from 2018 that sits perfectly alongside the newer songs as he recalls a warm night skinny dipping with a friend.

3Qfw6pon9tA,Tom Jones: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bob Boilen | June 7, 2021
We're publishing this Tom Jones Tiny Desk (home) concert on his 81st birthday. It's a poignant moment in the life of a singer whose career spans 56 years and more than 100 million records sold; the passing of his wife, Linda, in 2016 after 59 years of marriage was devastating and resulted in the longest break between recordings of his career. But now Tom Jones is back with a new album, Surrounded By Time, and ready to share his deepest feelings, channeling songs by others with a voice still rich and muscular. It's a triumphant return to the Tiny Desk (his first visit was in 2009), and it's the first time he's performed these songs since recording them last year.

The songs on the album (and for this Tiny Desk) deal so eloquently with time and aging. Tom Jones sings Bob Dylan's ""One More Cup Of Coffee"" and going ""down to the valley below."" Then, he takes on Malvina Reynolds' folk tune ""There's No Hole In My Head"" and turns it into a fierce statement about being yourself.

When Tom Jones was 33, and after one of his infamous shows in Las Vegas, jazz composer Bobby Cole presented him with the song ""I'm Growing Old."" With lyrics including ""I'm growing dimmer in the eyes / I'm growing fainter in my talk / I'm growing deeper in my sighs / I'm growing slower in my walk."" Tom Jones didn't feel old enough to do it justice, but he held on to it. His performance here brought me to tears and is well worth the wait.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Lyndsey McKenna | June 3, 2021
If you’ve ever seen a Hold Steady show, then you know it’s an experience, complete with communal singalongs and confetti. But for its first-ever full-band Tiny Desk appearance, the group squeezed behind a cramped backstage corner of the Brooklyn Bowl, COVID mask protocol in place (“Unusual times, unusual measures,” Craig Finn explains). 

Illuminated by string lights, the band ran through tracks from its latest album, Open Door Policy, kicking off with “Heavy Covenant” as a swell of clarinets and trumpets round out the sound (“The Horn Steady,” as Finn tells it). Though the lineup consisted of its current supersized iteration – featuring both Steve Selvidge on guitar and multi-instrumentalist Franz Nicolay back on accordion – the band scaled back its swagger for the space. Here, the recurring “Woos!” on the recorded version of “Unpleasant Breakfast” become softer and more subtle; the surf sounds of “Riptown” still rolick, but with restraint that suits the setting.

Even after eight studio albums and nearly two decades, it’s surreal to think that any band can still have the capacity to surprise. But to this fan’s ears, Open Door Policy upends expectations and redefines what The Hold Steady sound can be. And even in a compact – and crowdless – setting, there’s still so much joy to be found in what The Hold Steady has built for almost 20 summers.

It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bob Boilen | June 2, 2021
There's a comfort to be found singing in a bathroom; we all sound better with our voices bouncing off the tiles. For Sasha Spielberg, a.k.a. Buzzy Lee, she took it a step further, recording her Tiny Desk (home) concert in her childhood bathroom, which her parents decorated with images of fairytales.

Sasha Spielberg tells me there's ""Cinderella and her fairy godmother, the Seven Dwarfs and the Three Wise Men of Gotham, which is part of Mother Goose, apparently."" She continues, ""This bathroom is where I would go to sing. I would make up songs about each of the fairytales on the tiles, and I could sing as loud as I wanted, and it felt as if I had enough privacy. It was my escape. I'd spend hours on end in here dreaming of singing in front of people. It's also where I wrote my first song, age 5, 'You're Just Like Pie Crust.' It was a pop song. Huge hit.""

Buzzy Lee captured my heart with her 2021 album Spoiled Love, an album produced with Nicolas Jaar. With musicians Adam Gunther sitting in the tub playing modular synths and Jorge Balbi Castellano seated on the 'throne' playing drum pads, we hear songs and tales with different themes: obsession, love, attachment, and self-doubt, all filled with playful wordplay and her passionate voice.

tJKwzmJSpN8,Fat Joe: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Abby O'Neill | June 1, 2021
Latino hip-hop legend Fat Joe muscled his way out of the streets of the South Bronx with his debut album, Represent, in 1993. He radiates a different energy in 2021, sauntering in his own uptown streetwear shop, fresh fitted in pink leather and a designer bucket hat, but he's still got that old larger-than-life electricity.

A founding member of the D.I.T.C. (Diggin' In the Crates) crew, Fat Joe Da Gangsta has managed to last nearly 30 years and multiple generations in the rap game without ever giving up his lease on the top of the charts. That's no easy feat for a rapper who came out of the early '90s, and positively trailblazing for a Puerto Rican emcee without any notable predecessors. That catalog is on display in a medley of hits performed for his Tiny Desk (home) concert with the Terror Squad Band, and it's clear that Joe is amped up rocking with a live outfit that keeps the essence of his hits while infusing some salsa that reps his Latino heritage.

That crew turns the rugged ""My Lifestyle"" into a visceral experience with layers of nuance added by Joe's longtime DJ Ted Smooth. On the 2002 smash ""What's Luv,"" Angelica Vila takes the spotlight singing a hook originally performed by Ashanti. ""Sunshine,"" is an effervescent new springtime jam that was spawned by 22-year-old internet sensation Amorphous, who mashed up Luther Vandross's debut single ""Never Too Much"" with Rihanna's ""Kiss It Better."" Joe, who has always had a solid ear for new talent and a prowess for pinning down a buoyant hit record, came in and gullied this sparkling jam, renewing a glow that's been dim for this last year.

MQSos6YvrKk,Karol G: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Anamaria Sayre | May 27, 2021
Colombian reggaetonera Karol G floats between styles on this wistful Miami set with the breeziness of a pop star who knows no boundaries – or maybe it's the calculus of an artist who has built a career on subverting them. Her personal, unapologetic flourish has allowed her to top the Billboard charts of a genre with limited female participation, and even less superstardom.

Her signature bichota energy is subtle, yet pervasive in her stripped-down Tiny Desk (home) concert. Flanked by an illuminated all-women band, Karol G's authentic command of the intimate moment and its intended audience is unmistakable. She's stepping down from atop the glossy sets and sparkly stages to share secrets — lessons learned during her sudden ascent about humility, grace and empowerment — with the millions of niñitas who will watch this concert, enraptured by her effortless confidence and smooth Spanish bars.

Without a doubt, Karol G strikes a perfect balance here of vulnerability and star power, taking us on a journey through her many iterations. She deftly moves from a ballad-like rendition of urbano mash-up ""Créeme/A Ella"" to a soulful performance of trap corrido ""200 COPAS"" (her proclaimed favorite song at the moment) with Mexican Regional cariño Danny Felix. Closing with a first-ever live performance of the dreamy duet ""CONTIGO VOY A MUERTE,"" she marks the end of the concert with a nod to her roots. Intertwined with fellow Colombiano Camilo, Karol G expresses gratitude and pride; she is the unguarded depiction of a superstar eternally enamorado with her fans and her country.

YN3SNoTrLY4,Brothers Osborne: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Lyndsey McKenna | May 26, 2021
Since last year, many musicians have had to confront their own version of the ""if a tree falls in a forest"" thought experiment: If you release a new album but can't tour, will the music still resonate for listeners stuck at home? On their superb 2020 album, Skeletons, Brothers Osborne — a country duo that's long challenged the conventions of country and still managed to top the charts — intentionally turned up the volume to create a stadium-sized sound. The problem? ""We put it out and performed it nowhere,"" John Osborne told Morning Edition.

For their Tiny Desk (home) concert, brothers John and T.J. scale to fit the setting – John's wood-panelled Nashville living room furnished with plenty of guitars and a tiny desk featuring a Maryland flag mug – but refuse to dial down the intensity. Opening with the explosive instrumental track ""Muskrat Greene,"" Brothers Osborne and their collaborators use their set to showcase the very best of Skeletons. As on the record, they transition immediately into ""Dead Man's Curve,"" a track that's the ideal interplay between John's fiery guitar and T.J.'s singular vocal stylings.

""I hope it's good,"" T.J. confesses near the concert's conclusion. ""We really haven't been performing a lot for obvious reasons."" If John and T.J. can create this incendiary of an experience from a living room, just imagine hearing the anthems ""I'm Not For Everyone"" and ""Hatin' Somebody"" surrounded by thousands of fellow fans this fall.

It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Marissa Lorusso | May 25, 2021
Deep Sea Diver's Jessica Dobson didn't neglect the details for the group's Tiny Desk (home) concert. For starters, she sported an impressive homemade bolo tie that she crafted from an NPR enamel pin and ""a little bit of duct tape."" She also chose a very particular location for the shoot: ""There were countless times this past year that I wanted to be transported out of my house and into a different world,"" the singer and guitarist explains to NPR via email. ""One of my favorite and most inspiring worlds is that of David Lynch's Twin Peaks. I wanted to pay homage to the show by recreating the red room for our Tiny Desk.""

Inside the red room, the set includes three tracks from Deep Sea Diver's marvelous 2020 album, Impossible Weight, plus ""Stop Pretending,"" which was chosen as one of NPR Music's favorite songs of 2020. Joining the band are some special guests: Natalie Schepman and Meegan Closner of the band Joseph sing background vocals, and Dobson's Beagle, Henry, makes an appearance. (Dobson claims he's the only one who didn't care that Deep Sea Diver couldn't tour last year.) The performance itself is a testament to the group's attention to detail, too; as in many of the best Tiny Desk concerts, the band's magnetic energy and finely-crafted songs make the small space feel huge and joyous.

It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bob Boilen | May 24, 2021
Get ready for some fiery desert guitar-shredding, Saharan style, with the music of Mdou Moctar. Producer and American bassist Mikey Coltun told me that ""the concert was filmed outside of the house we were all staying at in Niamey, Niger, in November/December 2020."" He continued, ""As with any sort of musical happenings in the region, once some music is blasted, that's an invitation for anyone to come join, sing, clap, dance, and just come together as a community. We wanted to present the Tiny Desk exactly like this, from when we started playing to finally the energy growing with fans crowded around filming on their cell phones and passing around Tuareg tea.""

The (home) concert starts off with Mahamadou Souleymane, a.k.a. Mdou Moctar, playing a melodic line on acoustic guitar, with Ahmoudou Madassane on rhythm guitar, Souleymane Ibrahim playing percussion on a calabash, and Mikey Coulton on his Fender Mustang bass on the song ""Ya Habibti"" from the album Afrique Victime. It's an album of songs dealing with intense subjects close to Mdou Moctar's heart: colonialism, exploitation, inequality, but also love.

You can hear the real musical fire on the last song, the roughly 7-minute psych-rock title track to Afrique Victime. ""Africa is a victim of so many crimes,"" Mdou Moctar sings in French.""If we stay silent, it will be the end of us."" Silence is not something in Mdou Moctar's vocabulary.

ABjmQCxA7UU,Laurie Anderson: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bob Boilen | May 20, 2021
Laurie Anderson is a revolutionary artist who has mixed storytelling, music and technology for the past four decades plus. This Tiny Desk (home) concert celebrates the truly breathtaking breakthrough album she put out in 1982, Big Science. On that record, she used a few different voice processors; one of them was a Vocoder. By singing into a microphone attached to a keyboard, you can hear how it effectively adds harmony to her voice on ""Let x=x."" Laurie Anderson also used that effect, creating what I think of as 'the voice of authority' in her storytelling, on ""O Superman,"" a song unlike anything music I'd heard when it came out in 1981. She made use of a vocal loop, something ever-present these days in sampling, but here she uses an Eventide Harmonizer, looping the single syllable ""ha"" as the rhythm of the song. It's a song about dealing with the technological revolution, about compassion; if it's your first time hearing it, take it in and see what strikes you.

Here, Roma Baran, who played on and produced Big Science with Laurie Anderson in 1982, performs on synthesizer. We also hear some brilliant cello and improv from Rubin Kodheli.

On a personal note, I was a lover of Laurie's music back in those days; they were also the days I played synthesizer in my band Tiny Desk Unit. We opened for Laurie Anderson in 1981, and Laurie joined us onstage for a song. I bring this up because the Tiny Desk name (created by our guitarist Michael Barron) was familiar to Laurie long before this NPR series existed. At the end of her home concert, Laurie, I assume, mistakingly, thanks Tiny Desk Unit for having her. It made me smile and sparked so many memories. Thank you, Laurie.

ecZNktlc-CE,Kathleen Edwards: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bob Boilen | May 19, 2021
From a house in East Nashville, Kathleen Edwards sings about how thankful she is for those early aughts when she was praised with awards, television appearances, touring to packed venues — even if the tour bus with the bed in back was ""total crap."" As she continues to sing ""Glenfern,"" the opening track to her first album in eight years as well as this Tiny Desk (home) concert, she remembers her former husband and collaborator.

But, as thankful as she is for those years, they overwhelmed her, and she quit. Struggling with depression, Kathleen Edwards opened a coffee shop called Quitters Coffee and lived a very different life.

A handful of years later, in 2017, she was invited to Nashville by Maren Morris to write some songs. That Nashville visit sparked a new beginning and eventually the 2020 album Total Freedom, which birthed the four songs you hear in this Tiny Desk concert.

She's flanked by her carefully masked musical mates: guitarist Todd Lombardo, who also plays on Kathleen's latest album, and Justin Schipper on dobro. Kathleen Edwards seems happy playing these new songs. They can be songs of sadness, sometimes filled with seething, such as ""Ashes to Ashes,"" but she's also grateful for her everlasting love for a four-legged creature and the little catalpa tree where it's buried. She's found strength after those nonstop years — a lesson for us all, perhaps about life and time and its gift.

yBEWlarv8Tk,Palberta: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Marissa Lorusso | May 18, 2021
While many of us have gotten better at using technology to feel close to our friends and collaborators over the past year, there's still no replacement for being in the same room as someone who you swear can read your mind. That's what it feels like to watch punk band Palberta, whose music makes magic out of repeated phrases sung in tight harmony and charmingly zany pop hooks. For its Tiny Desk (home) concert, shot on a MiniDV and a Hi8, the band crams into one member's Philly basement for a set that's a testament to the group's tight-knit collaboration and playful exuberance.

The guitar-bass-drums trio is made up of Ani Ivry-Block, Nina Ryser and Lily Konigsberg, and each member sings and plays each instrument. Here, they trade places every couple of songs for a handful of tracks from the band's recently-released album Palberta5000 – including the frenzied opener ""Eggs n' Bac,'"" the queasy-yet-sentimental ""The Cow"" and the anxious and melodic ""Big Bad Want"" – plus a sweet testament to grooving called ""Sound Of The Beat"" from 2018's Roach Goin' Down. The songs aren't over-complicated but still manage to surprise at every turn – a true Palberta specialty. ""We've been a band for eight years,"" Konigsberg explains after the first song with a giggle, ""and we're gonna be rockin' out forever, together."" I certainly hope so.

1aq9WjdCUik,Sara Watkins: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bob Boilen | May 13, 2021
This is so enchanting. The painted scrim, the scenery trees are not only a setting for Sara Watkins and her bandmates, but we also discover a ""magic desk."" And as Sara lifts the desk's top, we hear a guitar playing an alluring melody; in fact, it's Harry Nilsson's dreamy song ""Blanket For a Sail.""

I admired Sara's talents first as a fiddler, guitarist and singer playing in Nickel Creek, then her solo work, and much later with the trio I'm With Her. However, none of her music, even her solo recordings, ever sounded quite like the music on this Tiny Desk (home) concert. The songs are from her new album, Under the Pepper Tree.

""It's a children's record, largely inspired by thinking back on the music that meant so much to me as a kid,"" she says. ""I've got a daughter now, and so much of the music that I heard as a kid has stayed with me and served me well.""

One of music's magical properties for Sara is the way it can ease transitions. Maybe it's from childhood to adolescence, or falling in and out of love, or simply getting your child to sleep. For this Tiny Desk, we hear old cowboy tunes via the Sons of the Pioneers or Rogers and Hammerstein's ""You'll Never Walk Alone."" Yet, even Sara's original songs have that feeling of serenity and grace, like a world with a magical desk or curling up in a blanket under a pepper tree.

iFS4_4Ji_-E,Ani DiFranco: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bob Boilen | May 10, 2021
Ani DiFranco has always done things her way, and for this Tiny Desk (home) concert, she’s a one-woman team, filming and recording herself in the front hall of her New Orleans home and studio, Big Blue. The not-so-tiny desk you see in the hallway was her great grandfather’s. Other personal items seen as we scan her home include a purple painting of a tree by her cousin Jim Mott and a portrait of a woman and ghostly girl by a painter named Renata. At the time of this recording, Ani was planning to move after more than 10 years at Big Blue, so this concert is likely one of the last performances to take place in that space.

Ani opened her set with “Everest” from the 1999 album, Up Up Up Up Up Up, a song that for me is about viewing life through different lenses and finding beauty. Next, she sings the title track to her 1995 album, Not a Pretty Girl, which shakes the shackles of stereotypes. Her final song for this (home) concert is from her 22nd album and her latest release, Revolutionary Love. The song brings compassion to troubled times by dismissing hatred -- or in her words, “To forgive but not forget.” It’s a message that shows the beauty and power of this artist, and her heart.

Nikki Birch | May 7, 2021
The Church Studios in North London is an institution, home to some of the most iconic records of the last three decades, including Eurythmics' Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) and Adele's 25. From the hallowed Neve Room, Moses Boyd and his band remind us that the U.K. jazz scene still bangs. They also remind us that COVID-19 regulations are much stricter across the pond: physical distancing is the name of the game in this at home concert.

The set begins with ""Stranger Than Fiction,"" a bouncy grime tune that features saxophonist Quinn Oulton, whose pedals lend his horn a dark and haunting quality. Boyd humbly introduces the band and slips right into ""2 Far Gone,"" and we get a chance to sink our teeth into his virtuosic drumming. Dynamic, at times explosive, and always tasteful, he lays down a bed of rhythm that gives keyboardist Renato Paris and guitarist Artie Zaitz plenty of room to shine. Then it's dancing time! ""BTB"" is a funky Afrobeat tune with an infectious melody that serves as the perfect closer.

Bob Boilen | May 6, 2021
It may at first seem that Negativland's sound collage is an unlikely candidate for a Tiny Desk concert, but honestly, how many bands can you think of making music since the late 1970s while sitting pretty much at their desks? Formed in the Bay Area, Negativland are proud subverters of culture, causing trouble while having fun.

The found sounds of Negativland come from original members David Wills, Mark Hosler, and Jon Leidecker (from left to right on the bottom of the screen), with visuals by Kevin Slagle and Sue Slagle (top of the screen).

Negativland are provocateurs, taking aim at the media and how technology alters our perception of the world. You can hear that on their 2020 album, The World Will Decide. This Tiny Desk (home) concert looks frightfully similar to the way many of us work these days — on video conference calls, reacting in real-time to our colleagues, dissecting our interactions ... but also occasionally having fun.

Felix Contreras | May 5, 2021
I'm a little envious of those of you about to press play on this Tiny Desk (home) concert. The first time I heard this Argentine duo was love at first sight.

Vocalist and upright bassist Cande Buasso and keyboardist Paulo Carrizo are from San Juan, Argentina, a very small town nestled by the Andes close to Chile. I like to imagine that the secluded location contributes to the magic and nuance of the very personal musical language the two have developed since forming the duo in 2017.

Things kick off with the magic turned up to 11 with Leonard Cohen's ""Treaty,"" from 2016's You Want It Darker. The duo's introduction to the world was a heartbreaking YouTube performance of ""Barro Tal Vez"" by the Argentine rocker and songwriter Luis Alberto Spinetta, and their performance of it here is no less haunting and captivating.

""Limite En Tu Amor,"" a cover of Feist's ""Limit To Your Love,"" is a preview of one of the tracks that will be included on their upcoming album of covers, produced by Grammy-winning producer Larry Klein. And they seal the deal with ""Tuyo,"" a nod to one of the most unheralded singer-songwriters in Latin America, Rodrigo Amarante of Brazil. Tuyo translates to ""yours"" and it's a fitting close to the briefest of introductions, but one strong enough to make Cande y Paulo one of our favorite discoveries of 2021.

From her hometown of San Juan, Puerto Rico, Calma Carmona delivers a bewitching Tiny Desk performance. Her voice rarely rises above a whisper as she sings over impassioned Afrobeats during her three-song set — but when it does, it's a gritty, intimidating growl.

""I feel that we are living in a crazy moment in a crazy time and music has been a safe place for me — the only safe place for me,"" Luedji Luna says in a low, alluring voice as she explains the purpose of her latest album, Bom Mesmo É Estar Debaixo D'Água. The album, much like the Brazillian singer-songwriters's Tiny Desk performance, is a respite from these times. Elements of jazz and blues are infused with African rhythms as Luna uses music to express her ongoing struggles for autonomy as a Black woman. She performs from her coastal hometown of Bahia in the city of Salvador, Brazil, where African culture flows in abundance. Luna is a powerhouse, entrancing and elegant, soulful and spiritual, as she uses her platform to discuss individual and systemic forms of anti-Blackness.

sR7JdLO_y5s,Rod Wave: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Mano Sundaresan | April 29, 2021
The first song Rod Wave performs in his Tiny Desk concert comes with a bit of a wink. The St. Petersburg, Fla., rapper interpolates Drake's ""Over My Dead Body,"" the delicate intro to Take Care. Like Drake, Rod Wave makes sad, melodic rap music. But his feels removed from the Canadian superstar's lineage. His cadences are more in step with the full-bodied crooning of Southern rap giants like Kevin Gates and Lil Boosie. It's been said that Rod Wave could be an R&B or blues singer in another era. With this Tiny Desk concert, anchored by the interplay of flute, piano, bass and drums, he seems to suggest: Why not this one?

Cast against a leafy, luxurious backdrop, Rod and his band deliver fiery renditions of three songs off his new album SoulFly, as well as his 2020 hit record ""Rags2Riches."" When he sings — about coming out of the trenches, about being away from his loved one, about perceptions of his artistry — you can feel the weight of those thoughts pouring out of every line. You can see it, too, in the way he shuts his eyes, grips the mic, sways back and forth. In light of his massive success — he's quite clearly one of the biggest rappers in the country right now — he could've treated this Tiny Desk like a victory lap, but instead, he brings the same heart and earnestness that's made him so beloved.

Lr3T3BxxSVA,Son Lux: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Robin HIlton | April 28, 2021
Watch this stunning ""home"" Tiny Desk performance from Son Lux and you might conclude the band members live together in an all-white universe without walls or boundaries. But it's all an illusion. In fact, guitarist Rafiq Bhatia, drummer Ian Chang and singer-keyboardist Ryan Lott, who started Son Lux as a solo project back in 2008, each shot their own, separate video with their iPhones, at different times, at their homes scattered across different states. So did the guest vocalists, Nina Moffitt and Kiah Victoria. Editor Evan Chapman then stitched all the videos together.

The effect is dizzying and sometimes disorienting as superimposed images flicker and warble over one another against Bhatia's skittering guitar lines. Everything is bent and a little off – intentionally, not because of the production challenges – and nothing sounds quite like you expect it to. Watch Bhatia's all-too-short solo on ""Only"" or Lott as he walks his fingers over the keys near the beginning of ""Vacancy."" Together – and alone – they've perfectly captured the upside-down world we've been living in this past year, where the lines between what's real and imagined are blurred, all sense of place fades into the ether and the normally predictable rhythms of life come undone.

The setlist for this performance includes a song from each of the band's last three albums, a trilogy released over the past eight months, called Tomorrows I, II and III.

N_t55quR7x8,Lake Street Dive: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Josh Rogosin | April 27, 2021
Lake Street Dive filmed its Tiny Desk (home) concert where the band is most at home: on stage at the “biggest little venue in NYC,” Pete’s Candy Store. All five band members managed to squeeze onto a stage no larger than the actual Tiny Desk to shine a spotlight on the Save Our Stages Act. Congress passed the $15 billion grant program last December as part of the $900 billion coronavirus relief bill. In the middle of the home concert, bassist Bridget Kearney recalls driving to the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn for a gig at Pete’s, then driving back to Boston the very same night, long before they ever sold out Radio City Music Hall on the other side of the East River. 

It’s hard to believe the band has released seven studio albums. Its latest, Obviously, provided the setlist for this intimate performance and prominently features the newest member and co-songwriter, keyboard and vocalist Akie Bermiss. Hopefully we’ll all be packed into tight venues again soon, adding the thunderous applause we’re all yearning to contribute. Until then, we’ll just have to settle for clapping at our screens.

6xzmBkhyGxQ,Shelley FKA DRAM: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bobby Carter | April 26, 2021
When D.R.A.M. played the Tiny Desk back in 2017, he made a couple of things clear to us: His playfully dynamic personality was primed for the spotlight, and beneath the catchy hooks, there's a real singer waiting to come out. For his Tiny Desk (home) concert, he does a complete 180. ""It's like a new beginning. Full circle. So this time, call me Shelley."" he says, following the opening track, ""Exposure."" Everything is new. Silk pajamas and slippers replace the trench coat and plush beanie, and thanks to lifestyle changes, he's slimmed down quite a bit and goes by his government name now: Shelley.

The shift from lighthearted melodic hip-hop to full-on R&B crooner shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone who's seen him perform live. It feels like it's his way of saying, ""Now that I have your attention, allow me to introduce myself."" We still get glimpses of the ""Big Baby"" here and there — the charm, a little bit of silliness, and the million-dollar grin — but other than that, it's grown folks business and vocally flawless performance. For the Shelley Show, he gathers a groovy band in front of a massive bookshelf and runs through selections, including the premiere of ""Rich & Famous"" from his upcoming self-titled project, due out on April 29, his late mother's birthday. If D.R.A.M. was the ploy to break into the music industry, then Shelley is the longevity play.

mkYN0mzY_2E,Tiny Desk Meets AFROPUNK: ChocQuibTown,"LaTesha Harris | April 25, 2021
Tiny Desk Meets AFROPUNK is the electrifying kick-off to AFROPUNK's ""Black Spring"" festival. The virtual celebration, hosted by Jorge ""Gitoo"" Wright, features performances from ChocQuibTown, Calma Carmona, Luedji Luna and Nenny. AFROPUNK, born out of a 2003 short film by the same name, is an international movement and music festival centered on Black exploration and rebellion. Starting as a way to create space for the unacknowledged presence and influence of Black culture in a predominantly white punk scene, AFROPUNK has since evolved into a distinct, multi-genre experience.
""Black Spring"" was created to spotlight outstanding talent in Afro-Latine and Afro-Caribbean music across the globe. The Tiny Desk Meets AFROPUNK program aims for the same. The showcase's four artists have come to the Tiny Desk to honor their homes and celebrate the art their heritage has inspired. Learn more about them below.

ChocQuibTown
""¡Tú sabes!"" Carlos ""Tostao"" Valencia exclaims after Colombian hip-hop trio ChocQuibTown performs its first song, the energetic ""Somos Pacífico."" ""ChocQuibTown, straight from Colombia, from the Pacific coast,"" he says. ""We call it Africa inside Colombia, we got the flavor, we got the flow."" ChocQuibTown — named after the coastal area the trio hails from — is a family affair comprised of siblings Miguel ""Slow"" Martinez and Gloria ""Goyo"" Martinez, the latter of which is married to Valencia. In 2000, the trio formed to promote their neglected corner of Colombia's culture; today, ChocoQuibTown's music blends the traditionality of Afro-Latin jazz with the modernity of hip-hop to create a singular, yet versatile sound.

NENNY
With warm maroon box braids nearly sweeping the floor and glitter adorning her eyes, NENNY's presence demands full attention before she even opens her mouth. Dressed in a flowy, all-white outfit accented with a pastel checker pattern and surrounded by a matching four-piece band, the 18-year-old Portuguese singer-songwriter and rapper appears otherworldly, almost heavenly, as she harmonizes with her backing electric guitar and jumps across the room, dancing with her entire body. NENNY first appeared on heads' radar in 2019 with her single ""Sushi."" She's continued to impress with several more singles and the release of her debut project, 2020's Aura.

Luedji Luna
""I feel that we are living in a crazy moment in a crazy time and music has been a safe place for me — the only safe place for me,"" Luedji Luna says in a low, alluring voice as she explains the purpose of her latest album, Bom Mesmo É Estar Debaixo D'Água. The album, much like the Brazillian singer-songwriters's Tiny Desk performance, is a respite from these times. Elements of jazz and blues are infused with African rhythms as Luna uses music to express her ongoing struggles for autonomy as a Black woman. She performs from her coastal hometown of Bahia in the city of Salvador, Brazil, where African culture flows in abundance. Luna is a powerhouse, entrancing and elegant, soulful and spiritual, as she uses her platform to discuss individual and systemic forms of anti-Blackness.

SET LIST

“Lençois”
“Erro”
“Chororô""

Calma Carmona
From her hometown of San Juan, Puerto Rico, Calma Carmona delivers a bewitching Tiny Desk performance. Her voice rarely rises above a whisper as she sings over impassioned Afrobeats during her three-song set — but when it does, it's a gritty, intimidating growl. Carmona got her start in 2013 when the Latin soul singer-songwriter released her first EP and opened for Beyoncé's The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour in Puerto Rico.

ZfqmSZ-6Cgo,Butcher Brown: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Nikki Birch | April 21, 2021
Butcher Brown takes to a restaurant's rooftop terrace in the band's hometown of Richmond, Va., for a home concert and sizzles from the first note. The band opens with ""Sticky July,"" a tune every bit as catchy as its name implies; think rollerskating with a popsicle under a cloudless sky of blue. When you think you've figured it out, keyboardist DJ Harrison switches it up, launching into a solo so funky you wonder if it's a new song, that is until Marcus ""Tennishu"" Tenney brings us back home with some sweet trumpet.

That's the thing about Butcher Brown: are they playing jazz ... or funk ... or soul? They scoff at the limitations of adjacent genres with the expertise of master musicians who've played together so long that they flow from one vibe to the next without missing a beat. This is clear as they slide into ""Camden Square,"" but not before Tennishu introduces the band, thanks their parents, and shouts out Ann Paciulli, who provided the old-school desk seen in the video. Viewers of a certain vintage may recall interminable afternoons spent sitting in a tiny desk just like that one. Fortunately, boredom is the last thing that happens when Butcher Brown hits. ""#KingButch"" is next, a stank-face hip-hop head-bobber that once again proves they can do it all. (And yes, not only does Tennishu rap, he also plays sax and trumpet, which is no minor feat.) They close with ""Tidal Wave"": smooth, delightful, classic.

SW6L_lTrIFg,C. Tangana: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Anamaria Sayre | April 20, 2021
C. Tangana's extended family basking in the warmth of sobremesa with easy smiles and effortless baile looks otherworldly after more than 13 months amid a global pandemic. But considering the Spanish rapper's past year back home in Madrid, the simplicity feels fiercely authentic. (Check his mama and tía vibing in the corner.)

This first live performance of his latest album, El Madrileño (including a global premiere of a fresh single, ""Me Maten"") buzzes with communal energy, spotlighting talent from across Latin landscapes. From Mexican Regional to Spanish flamenco, C. Tangana is simultaneously coming home and reaching out to bridge Latin music boundaries. He's building a community of cross-cultural collaboration, rooted in a unifying love of language and tradition, making it clear he's intent on giving everyone a seat at the table.

The entirety of the show, from impromptu harmony to string octet, hums along with a distinctly Spanish cadence, paying homage to the flamenco-infused streets the global superstar came up in. The concert's star-studded cast of Spanish collaborators, including long-time friends (producers Alizzz and Victor Martínez) and new contributors (rumba legend Kiko Veneno and flamenco-pop icon La Húngara), are each spotlighted for their contributions to the record.

All these parts compound in a room full of people with a shared desire to connect and create juntos, manifesting an authentic joy we've seen again and again at the real Tiny Desk. And at the helm is C. Tangana, humming a melody and bringing the room to life: hands, harmonies, heartbeats, perfectly in sync.

85_uFm1R5TA,Rina Sawayama: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Alex Ramos | April 19, 2021
As usual, Rina Sawayama is one step ahead of us. She's back in the office, clad in a periwinkle blazer with waist cut-outs and a high ponytail cleaner than the view of the city skyline. Make no mistake: even in fluorescent lighting, the Japanese British pop star performs with the same tenacity and drama you hear in her 2020 debut album, SAWAYAMA, a lustrous pop epic peppered with early aughts R&B, nu-metal and classic rock.

Unable to tour because of the pandemic, the artist has been holding onto these songs for the last year. Sawayama's Tiny Desk (home) concert successfully reminds us — in just three tracks — of her range and versatility as both artist and performer. Tears calcify in ""Dynasty,"" a song like a salve to wounds inherited from generations past. The heaviness of the music never overshadows her voice, which ascends heroically. ""Won't you break the chain with me?"" she belts out.

As if turning the other cheek, Sawayama swiftly moves into the sweet, cha-ching pop of ""XS,"" and later the soft-hearted ballad ""Chosen Family,"" rendered in the style of her 2021 collaboration with Elton John. The song was reborn, in part, because of John's admiration for Sawayama and her ability to cross-pollinate genres, but also because the two held ""Chosen Family,"" both the song and concept, dearly. Funny enough, the song's thesis — ""I chose you / You chose me"" — reflects their meeting, too.

DN1Y-tbCHvA,CARM: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future.

It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bob Boilen | April 15, 2021
For the Tiny Desk (home) concert series, 'home' can mean many things. For CJ Camerieri and his project CARM, home is where the art is. He performed his concert at the Pablo Center in Eau Claire, Wisc., where the trumpeter and French horn player conceived and recorded all the songs for his 2021 debut solo album, CARM. ""This particular community has been a really big part of my musical life for 10 years,"" CJ says after playing the calming tune ""Soft Night,"" ""so it seems like the perfect place to be doing this.""

CJ Camerieri is a co-founder of the ensemble yMusic, a member of Paul Simon's band, a collaborator with Bon Iver and a Tiny Desk alum. (You can hear his French horn with The Tallest Man On Earth from their 2019 Tiny Desk Concert.) For this home concert, Trever Hagen joins him to provide the electronic pulse, trumpet, and other textures to the mix. On song two, he welcomes fellow Eau Claire musician S. Carey, a drummer and singer with Bon Iver, as well as someone I've admired as a solo artist. Here he plays piano and sings a song CJ co-wrote with Sufjan Stevens titled ""Song of Trouble."" It's a song written pre-pandemic and, like so many songs, has taken on new significance. And that goes for both the jittery electronica and the calming horns we hear; it's music that's resonated with me all year long.

Ehw07lXL1AY,Demi Lovato: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Lyndsey McKenna | April 14, 2021
A few years ago, some of us on the NPR Music team stumbled upon a copy of Demi Lovato's 2013 book, Staying Strong: 365 Days A Year. Reading Lovato's heartfelt daily reflections became a workday habit; her transparency and vulnerability made us ardent admirers who wanted nothing but the very best for Demi.

We made it our mission to get Demi to the Tiny Desk, and though the pandemic had other plans, Lovato's Tiny Desk (home) concert was worth the wait. Recorded on a sunny spring day in her Los Angeles backyard, Lovato begins with a moving rendition of ""Tell Me You Love Me"" from her 2017 record of the same name, accompanied by subtle, sparse keys. She continues her set with the title tracks from her recently-released studio album, Dancing With The Devil...The Art Of Starting Over. On both tracks, Lovato's voice feels stabilizing and grounding; there's a sense of clarity and purpose in its power.

When interviewed by NPR's Ailsa Chang back in 2017, Demi Lovato said, ""I think I've lived a lot of life."" Through both her struggles and successes, Lovato's shown all sides of herself – the confident and unapologetic star, but also the complexities of recovery – inviting us on her journey in a deeply personal way. Her intimate (home) concert feels like a natural extension of that sincerity.

Q3p7JxooncM,Nathaniel Rateliff: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bob Boilen | April 12, 2021
Nathaniel Rateliff stands in an old familiar place, sharing his pain. The Mercury Café is one of the first places Nathaniel frequented when he moved to Denver in 1998, hearing jazz, dancing, and eventually playing many shows there. For his Tiny Desk (home) concert, he's assembled a dozen players including a string section, backing singers, and some of his oldest friends: Joseph Pope III on bass, Mark Shusterman on keys, Luke Mossman on guitar and Patrick Meese on drums. On the opening song and the title track to his 2020 album, And It's Still Alright, they're restrained as Nathaniel sings about loss, including his friend and producer Richard Swift, but he's holding on. ""I'll be damned if this old man / Don't start to counting his losses / But it's still alright.""
But restraint lets loose on the chorus of ""Redemption,"" a song about breaking free of the past and written for Apple original film Palmer, starring Justin Timberlake. The ender, a tune called ""Mavis,"" truly is a grand finale, a song that conjures up images of The Band singing Bob Dylan's ""I Shall Be Released"" — and what a fabulous release it is.

Fn6S9NTpPvk,Tiny Desk Meets SXSW: clipping.,"Every year, NPR Music participates in the SXSW music festival, whether it's curating a stage or simply attending hundreds of shows at the annual event in Austin, Texas.

Stephen Thompson | April 8, 2021
Leave it to clipping. to innovate around the central notion of the Tiny Desk; to take the series' emphasis on close-up intimacy and transport it to new heights of, well, tininess.
This is, after all, a band that contains multitudes. Producers William Hutson and Jonathan Snipes craft a bed of hip-hop, industrial music and noisy experimentalism, then set loose rapper Daveed Diggs, whose violent imagery summons '90s horrorcore and a thousand bloody movies. The band's last two album titles — There Existed an Addiction to Blood and Visions of Bodies Being Burned — offer up a sense of the vibe, but Diggs' gift for rapid-fire wordplay also acts as a leavening agent. The guy won a Tony Award for playing Thomas Jefferson and the Marquis de Lafayette in Hamilton, and he still knows how to sell every word that leaves his lips.

So, yeah, multitudes. Plus, in this video, a few surprises to trick your eye and help pull you into a clever and disorienting world of sound.

Bobby Carter | April 7, 2021
DUCKWRTH decided to do something special for Tiny Desk Meets SXSW: brand new music. ""Welcome to my Tiny Desk,"" he says. ""We are gonna play some new songs for y'all if that's OK. Y'all ain't got no choice!""

The dynamic R&B singer proceeded to debut two exclusives: a slow jam titled ""make u go,"" which he dedicates to the ""lovers and freaks,"" and the upbeat ""Birthday Suit,"" which KCRW astutely compared to Estelle's ""American Boy.""

The new material wasn't the only thing that made this Tiny Desk such a treat. For this funky and flamboyant performance, DUCKWRTH dressed his backing band entirely in white and switched up the lighting for each song so that the hue matched the mood he was laying down.

DUCKWRTH has long been a creative soul. He spoke with NPR in 2019 about growing up in a Pentecostal household in South Central Los Angeles, and how those two worlds helped shape his journeys between R&B and West Coast G-funk.

C9fMzxICTjU,Tiny Desk Meets SXSW: Yasser Tejeda & Palotré,"Every year, NPR Music participates in the SXSW music festival, whether it's curating a stage or simply attending hundreds of shows at the annual event in Austin, Texas. Last year, the festival was canceled due to the pandemic, but it returned this March as an online festival.

Felix Contreras | April 6, 2021
If only I could have experienced Yasser Tejeda and Palotré at one of the bars along Austin's Sixth Street. Tejeda, a New York-based guitarist from the Dominican Republic, started his musical career on the Dominican cuatro (a folkloric guitar-like instrument) and has incorporated guitar stylings that have made him a ""go-to guy"" for Dominican artists looking for passionate elegance in their sound.

Yasser Tejeda and his band Palotré begin their set behind a home desk with ""Amor Arrayano,"" weaving a vaguely Caribbean feel with a killer R&B hook. After a brief introduction of his bandmates Tejeda launches into ""La Culebra,"" the track that caught my attention from their album Kijombo. Palotré is a powerful groove machine behind Tejeda's virtuosic guitar playing and his playful dance moves.

Tejeda has stated one of the goals of this project is to explore the crossroads between Afro-Dominican musical traditions with anything else that pops onto their radar. Their final song here,""Nuestras Raices,"" has become one of my favorites because I hear the essence of Africa mixed with jazz and maybe a hint of heavy metal, as Tejeda steps on his distortion pedal to kick the band into overdrive with guest tenor saxophonist Mario Castro in tow.
I won't spoil the surprise, but be sure to stay until the end.

Bob Boilen | April 5, 2021
We've posted close to 200 Tiny Desk (home) concerts in this insane pandemic year. Few have made me smile and laugh out loud as much as this one from Steady Holiday. I'll stop with the spoilers now.

Steady Holiday is the music of Dre Babinski. This video, filmed for our virtual SXSW showcase, finds her by the fireplace, a dog at her feet, an acoustic guitar in her arms. Steady Holiday is singing ""Living Life,"" a tune about a favorite topic of mine: the everyday, the mundane, and living in the moment. All the songs in this Tiny Desk (home) concert are from Steady Holiday's 2021 album Take The Corners Gently, a top album of mine this year. Laughing while her dog grabs a chew toy, she performs the album's opening track, ""White Walls,"", a song about self-reflection and how doing the same thing over and over (""painting white walls white"") won't make life better.

As her printer cues the last song, (oops, small spoiler), Steady Holiday takes us out on a lovely tune, ""Love Me When I Go To Sleep"": ""Fragile aren't we, who would guess / Here today, tomorrow's taking bets."" Her refrain amplifies that fragility with a reminder to appreciate the gift of life. ""Love me when I go to sleep / Love me with no certainty / Love me when I go to sleep.""

e0zFkeH9PAM,Tiny Desk (Home) Concert: Kacy & Clayton and Marlon Williams,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bob Boilen | March 29, 2021 - Across hemispheres, despite a nearly 8,000-mile separation, the Saskatoon, Canada duo of cousins Kacy & Clayton and New Zealand's Marlon Williams manage to create harmony and intimacy. The Tiny Desk (home) concert, on the surface, is joyful and playful with animated illustrations by Daniel Syrnick. But a careful listen to ""Plastic Bouquet,"" the title track to the 2020 collaboration between Kacy Lee Anderson, Clayton Linthicum, and Marlon Williams, reveals a depth of storytelling more familiar in murder ballads than the trio's upbeat Americana sound. 
Kacy sings, 
When a small four-door car was severed in two
Three girls were killed by a boy they all knew
Out for a party, they'd never attend 
Pockets with money they never would spend 

The devastatingly sad tale is met with smiles across hemispheres while an animated teacup pops on screen for Kacy to sip. Clayton's guitar twangs and Marlon's Roy Orbison-like voice conjure a 1950s rock and roll sound that's a surprisingly perfect match for Kacy's serene voice. It's a magic collaboration of the very far north meeting the very deep south. The wizardry of technology reminds me of the wondrous world we often share these days, from a distance.

bOf3tD0sMxQ,Buck Meek: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bob Boilen | March 25, 2021
The back of a van on a sunny day holding an acoustic guitar is a far cry from the usual setting where I'd see Buck Meek. More likely, I'd be in a dark club; Buck's intense electric guitar and backing vocals are a part of what makes up my favorite rock band these days, Big Thief. But here, home is Buck's Toyota Land Cruiser in Topanga Canyon, Calif.; Buck Meek is singing about the clouds and his favorite new word, pareidolia, which also happens to be the opening track to his 2021 album, Two Saviors.

Pareidolia is, as Buck Meek explains, ""this human instinct to put symbol to stimulus."" He says, ""I've been spending this time of solitude in the canyon here spending a lot of time observing the clouds and things"" — in other words, finding shapes and objects in clouds and objects where none intended to exist and perhaps turning them into stories or songs or just letting your mind wander. The Texas native has a tender voice with a bit of a yodel and a resplendent way with words. After three songs from Two Saviors, Buck treats us to a new song written in quarantine titled ""The Undae Dunes,"" once again drawing pictures in the sky, this time of rockets and perhaps an astronaut and a love, all from the back of a Cruiser.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bobby Carter | March 24, 2021
Liam Bailey is the type of artist that makes our jobs easy at the Tiny Desk. I can imagine him arriving at NPR headquarters early, guitar in tow, ready to bang out a three-song set in one take as staffers gather, fireside chat-style. That's what his home concert felt like. Wiping the sweat from his brow between songs, he exclaims, ""We're not doing no studio productions. We're keeping it real. Keeping it raw.""

Perched atop an amplifier in front the peeling walls of his living room, he presents three selections from his latest album, Ekundayo, accompanied by one acoustic guitar. Ekundayo, which means ""sorrows become joy"" in Yoruba, fittingly describes the Nottingham, England, native's music industry journey thus far. After various projects and record deals (including a stint on Lioness Records, the imprint founded by Amy Winehouse), he found it impossible to operate under the confines of a major label. He finally found the liberation he yearned for on Leon Michels's Big Crown Records, which released Ekundayo last November. For this performance, Bailey teeters between belting and crooning, with emotions that ignite the screen from the top of ""Fight"" to the closing notes of ""Paper Tiger.""

87_1W4P1F2A,Sting: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Abby O’Neill | March 22, 2021
Music icon Sting returns to Tiny Desk with a new collaborator in tow, and the story is heartwarming. During the pandemic, Beninese pop star Shirazee adapted his own rendition of Sting's classic ""Englishman in New York"" into ""African in New York."" His version made its way to Sting, who loved it so much that he asked Shirazee to lend his voice to his Tiny Desk (home) concert and record for his new Duets album.

Their chemistry feels natural and just as comforting as this long overdue sunshine after a grueling winter. Shot in a lounge in NYC where Sting's presently recording another album, these two gentlemen share a touching moment between songs, expressing their mutual admiration and discussing the sheer joy about a simple concept – performing in a room together after 12 long months of isolation and virtual collaborations.

As a follow up, Sting jumps into a stunning acoustic performance of ""If I Ever Lose My Faith in You,"" another one of his many classics. The timbre of his voice conjures a sense of carefree familiarity, reminiscent of times with more levity and peace. His finale, ""Sister Moon,"" is a gem from his 1987 solo album, Nothing Like the Sun, that rarely gets performed live.

Stephen Thompson | March 17, 2021
If you were to apply one of those ""how it started / how it's going"" memes to Tiny Desk (home) concerts — which began, it turns out, almost exactly one year ago — you'd have, under ""how it's going,"" the image of pop superstar Justin Bieber as he and his band perform the world premiere of a new song called ""Peaches.""

""Peaches"" will exist in a significantly different form when Bieber drops his new album Justice on Friday — the track will feature guest vocals from GIVEŌN and Daniel Caesar — just as ""Holy,"" another song from Justice, opens this set without the presence of guest Chance the Rapper. But Bieber's Tiny Desk set, performed with the aid of We the Band, provides the fullest taste yet (fully 25 percent!) of the singer's sixth album, whose singles have already been streamed hundreds of millions of times.

Bieber has had a massive month as he prepares for Justice to drop: March 2021 began with the singer's 27th birthday and recently produced his second career Grammy, as he took the prize for best country duo or group performance for ""10,000 Hours"" with Dan + Shay. It continues with this, his Tiny Desk debut. Friday, the next chapter officially begins.

zD9hyjbTuF0,Xavier Omär: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bobby Carter | March 15, 2021
Xavier Omär decided to turn his Tiny Desk home concert into a whole Texas affair. Initially, Omär wanted to recreate the look of the Desk: ""I wanted to kind of bring the feeling of Tiny Desk back, so I had booked a library,"" he said. Ultimately the library didn't work out, but Rosella Coffee and Wine in his home base of San Antonio proved to be a great match for his sound--spacious and airy.

Omär's career began in Christian music under the moniker SPZRKT, before he moved into secular R&B and hip-hop. Through his first couple of projects and work with Seattle DJ and producer, Sango, the 27-year-old singer's heart-on-sleeve approach quickly created a buzz. His latest album, if You Feel, was high on my favorite albums list of 2020.

The Alamo City resident and his cohorts orchestrated a charismatic and vocally rich show. The set list perfectly depicts the emotional arch of if You Feel. For good measure, he plays the song that put him on the map, 2016's ""Blind Man."" This is undoubtedly Xavier Omär's best live performance on record. He's on a clear path to greatness in R&B music.

npORmybcPdk,Black Coffee: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Abby O'Neill | March 11, 2021
Black Coffee, a figurehead of the global South African dance movement, is known for his undeniable DJ sets and AfroHouse anthems that (under normal circumstances) light up dancefloors around the world. He brings that same feeling to his Tiny Desk (home) concert, but with a unique configuration: live instrumentation. 

Born in Durban and raised in the Eastern Cape in Mthatha, Black Coffee’s subculture of soulful house transports me to an elevated state. If you ask me, this is the pure embodiment of feel-good music. That shouldn’t be a surprise, because house music has always been about love. It’s a form of sonic escapism that provides a sanctuary for all beings, regardless of race, age, or gender. Therefore, it’s only fitting that Black Coffee rocks a tee embossed with “I Heart You” across his chest. 

Shot in the auditorium at the National School of Arts in Johannesburg, Black Coffee tapped students to assist with production as part of their internship. Kicking off the set is “You Rock My World” featuring Soulstar, a classic dance joint from his Africa Rising album whose convergence of pulsating percussion, a calming melody, and the sultry vibes of Soulstar’s voice feels like a spiritual palette cleanser. He follows that up with ""Flava"" and ""Wish You Were Here,” two tracks from his new LP, Subconsciously, whose litany of special guests -- including Diplo and Pharrell -- is a coronation of Black Coffee’s meteoric rise.

8NqSBqTQIq4,Coming 2 America — Sounds of Zamunda: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bobby Carter | March 10, 2021
Over the years, African musicians have elevated expectations at the Tiny Desk. The distinctive vibrations left by artists like Burna Boy, KOKOKO! and the Soweto Gospel Choir have lead to some of the most unforgettable moments in our rich history. This (home) concert feels like the culmination of all of those moments.

To celebrate the new compilation Rhythms of Zamunda: Music Inspired By Coming 2 America, six artists representing four countries in Africa perform a megamix of selections from the project. Each performance from the pan-African project bridges the distance between the countries and cultures, and gets more exhilarating by the minute.

South Africa's Nasty C — who's arguably the biggest rapper on the continent — opens the set and trades verses with Tiny Desk alumni Ari Lennox on ""Black and White."" He then sends us over to Cameroon for some Afrobeats flavor, courtesy of Locko and his stripped-down version of ""Magnet."" We then circle back around to South Africa to hear from R&B newcomer Ricky Tyler. From there, we head north to Nigeria to do the ""Jiggy Bop"" with Alpha P before we take one last trip to South Africa for award-winning dance DJ and producer Prince Kaybee's ""Fetch Your Life,"" featuring Msaki. Finally, Togo duo Toofan dares us not to dance to ""Yé Mama.""

In addition to the sweeping range of the showings, the look of each set is stunning: vibrant, opulent colors; meticulous Tiny Desk shelf recreations; gorgeous African artifacts; and a few nuggets dedicated to King Akeem of Coming 2 America. This cultural clash is the biggest amplification of African voices we've ever had the pleasure of presenting.

Bob Boilen | March 9, 2021
""I'm Robin Pecknold from Fleet Foxes. Thank you so much for asking me to find the tiniest desk I could, and sing unadorned for the first time in too long.""

With his guitar and that unadorned voice, Robin Pecknold performs four songs from Fleet Foxes' 2020 album, Shore. It's an album that pays homage to some of the greats that we've lost — some more recently, including David Berman and Richard Swift, and some long gone but still influential, like Elliott Smith, Curtis Mayfield, Jimi Hendrix and Judee Sill. Robin wrote the songs while driving in the Catskills and (as you hear on ""Going-to-the-Sun Road"") Montana, a place that feels like home.

It's been a dozen years since Robin Pecknold's first, self-titled Fleet Foxes album, a record filled with harmony that brightened the somewhat dark lyrics. Here, alone, his message comes through even more apparent, and the songs written both before and during the pandemic shine light on darkness.

yB2p5Oaa5Js,Ólafur Arnalds: Tiny Desk (Home) Concerts,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bob Boilen | March 4, 2021
Using an Edison ""Fireside"" cylinder phonograph and his own Stratus music software, Ólafur Arnalds' Tiny Desk (home) concert brings the past and the future into a heartfelt performance. Filmed in his tree-lined studio in Reykjavík, Iceland (the former studio of Sigur Rós), Ólafur and his string quartet perform three songs from my personal No. 1 album of 2020, some kind of peace. The pensive set opens with an older tune, ""Happiness Does Not Wait,"" with Ólafur Arnalds seated at a short upright piano known as a Danish 'pianette.'

The delicate performance is the perfect window into this Icelandic composer's profound and passionate music. The Edison wax cylinder that we hear on ""Woven Song"" is a traditional Amazonian healing song sung by the late shaman Herlinda Agustin Fernandez.
Look closely at the piano toward the back of the studio during the tune ""Spiral,"" and you'll see a piano playing seemingly without a performer. That piano is reacting to Ólafur Arnald's real-time performance using algorithms he and his coder friend, Halldór Eldjárn, developed. He used it extensively when he came and performed his Tiny Desk concert at NPR in 2018. Ólafur Arnalds is a gentle subversive of 21st century music, and I'm so grateful to be able to present his enchanting sounds.

GNrerhak_pY,Jack Harlow: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bobby Carter | March 3, 2021
Jack Harlow's Tiny Desk (home) concert feels like the arrival of a rap superstar. Tucked in a homey-looking space in Los Angeles surrounded by bookshelves and vintage furniture, the Louisville, Ky., emcee delivers a performance with the confidence of an old pro. His set, however, is the first time he's relied solely on live instrumentation to bring his songs to life. ""It's been a long time since I had a chance to perform and I've never done it like this,"" he says.

This is a far stretch from the kid with loose curls and specs frolicing with his hometown friends, but his success should serve as a reminder of the importance of artist development. He's been able to slow cook for a few years, consistently dropping mixtapes and visuals until he landed a big hit last year in ""WHATS POPPIN."" That performance earned him a Grammy nomination ahead of his very impressive debut album, Thats What They All Say.

For this turn at the Tiny Desk, Harlow, his band and some background singers deliver a megamix of highlights from the album. The orchestration underscores his sentimental and introspective side on songs like ""Same Guy"" and ""Funny Seeing You Here,"" but it also elevates the melody, which is the true hero here. Over the past few years, the 22-year-old rapper has steadily ticked the boxes for a successful career, and this showing undoubtedly checks the performer section.

wRwId2RfmfA,Kirk Franklin: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"NPR Music's Tiny Desk series will celebrate Black History Month by featuring four weeks of Tiny Desk (home) concerts and playlists by Black artists spanning different genres and generations each week. The lineup includes both emerging and established artists who will be performing a Tiny Desk concert for the first time. This celebration highlights the beautiful cornucopia of Black music and our special way of presenting it. We hope you enjoy.

Bobby Carter | February 25, 2021
Kirk Franklin, set up with his band and choir in a corner of Uncle Jessie's Kitchen, makes a declaration. ""I know you're at home right now, in your draws, listening to some Jesus music. It's ok. Jesus loves you in your draws!"" The Arlington, Texas studio, named after a long time close friend, features a large photo of the iconic ""I AM A MAN"" protest signs from the 1968 Memphis Sanitation Strike on the wall. The jubilant energy that Franklin and company emit, juxtaposed with a visual reminder of the strife that Black people have endured is illustrative of the importance of gospel music in the Black community.

For nearly 30 years, Franklin has been widely regarded for revolutionizing gospel. He incorporated secular music, particularly hip-hop, while preserving the message and integrity of traditional gospel. Here, he and his powerhouse choir pace through a decades-long, sixteen Grammy award winning discography of faith, praise and encouragement while cracking plenty of jokes. I cannot recall a more moving Tiny Desk home performance.

All month long, we've presented artists that speak to the diversity and complexity of Black music--where we've been, where we are and where we're going. For the final show, we take it back to the spiritual roots and there's no one more fitting to cap things off than Mr. Kirk Franklin.

Abby O'Neill | February 24, 2021
Nigerian Afrobeats star Davido comes to us from his estate in Lagos with an intimate four-song performance that takes us on a mini-retrospective of his career. He and his band create a sultry vibe with a unique rendition of ""Gobe,"" his smash 2013 single, to open the set.

Davido has long expressed pride in his father's success. He titled his 2012 debut album Omo Baba Olowo, meaning ""son of a rich man"" in the Yoruba language. In his (home) concert, Davido cites his father as his inspiration in a sweet and tender moment: ""A Nigerian American like myself that studied in the States...I went to an HBCU, you know... My dad went to one as well and my dad used to work at Burger King. ... To become what he's become today as a Black man starting off in America has been very, very inspiring to me.""

In collaboration with the Alternate Sound band, Davido strips back ""Aye,"" a hit from 2014, with an unfettered rendition showcasing his natural voice devoid of any vocal effects. And the result sounds fantastic.

Like all touring artists, the pandemic forced Davido to spend extended time at his home instead of traveling the world. The last year allowed him to re-center himself in his motherland and inspired his 2020 release, A Better Time. Rounding out this Tiny Desk (home) concert, he concludes with ""Jowo,"" a single from the album that of conjures hope for better times ahead.

LaTesha Harris | February 23, 2021
""Freedom is what we feel when we perform. And freedom is what the world is in need of right now. In this pandemic it feels like we all need a sense of freedom."" Sampa Tembo is in Lusaka, Zambia, her landlocked African home country. She's better known as Sampa The Great, an understated title. In her Tiny Desk (home) concert, the poet, rapper and singer-songwriter delivers evidence that it's more like Sampa the Greatest.

Her set is rich with earth's abundances. She performs ""Rhymes To The East,"" ""Mwana,"" ""Freedom"" and ""Final Form"" — the latter three off 2019's The Return — surrounded by life. Warmth pours in from exuberant trilling, zealous drums and her seven-piece band's loose movements. Dressed in warm oranges and muted browns and wearing a crown resembling red clay, Sampa is Mother Earth herself.

Initially raised in Botswana, Sampa moved to Australia as a young adult and established herself in Sydney's hip-hop scene. There, she released two mixtapes, 2015's The Great Mixtape and 2017's award-winning Birds and the BEE9, all the while generating buzz. She had been based in Melbourne for the last four years, but the next chapter of her musical journey will find her at home in Zambia.

As displayed in her Tiny Desk, Sampa's artistic strength comes from the ease with which she cultivates connectivity. Music becomes a mode of generative healing that she shares with her bandmates, some of Lusaka's best musicians, collaborators and audience. It's the type of energy people need in this moment: precious and infinite.

8xoYo-rU_Xs,Bartees Strange: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Lars Gotrich | February 22, 2021
Bartees Strange and his band are in a basement, surrounded by electrical wiring and DIY sound-proofing, but also green plants that no doubt have names. In Falls Church, Va., the indie rocker is a stone's throw from the much-missed Tiny Desk space in D.C., yet offers a set just as cozy and crammed.
Just a cursory listen of Live Forever, one of NPR Music's 50 Best Albums of 2020, reveals a seeker with several destinations in mind: hip-hop bombast meets sprawling indie-rock riffs and mind-numbing electronic beats. ""Sonically it doesn't make sense,"" Bartees Strange told NPR Music, ""but it makes sense because it's me and I think that's like an important part of music – the person.""
For his Tiny Desk, Bartees Strange keeps the bluesy rock and roll bravado of ""Boomer"" and the loping smooveness of ""Mustang,"" stripping down the drum kit to include a sheet music stand as an extra cymbal. In between songs, he shouts out the musicians giving him joy lately: Yves Tumor and The National's Aaron Dessner, whom he calls ""the indie rock Michael Jordan.""
It's in the back half where Bartees Strange does the switch-up, as ""In A Cab"" flows seamlessly into ""Flagey God."" On record, these are louder and noisier songs that explore very different sides of his 20-sided die, but here, they become laid-back jazz club jams, deceptive in their ease, but beautifully ornate as the arrangements open up to his world.

Khalil's set is a colorful explosion of talent, perfectly complimenting the funky patchwork and textures of her attire.

She hit our radar and was featured on All Songs Considered last year, but gained national attention as a contestant on Netflix's music competition show, Rhythm + Flow. As an emcee, she enunciates and bends her words unlike anyone in the game and if the bars don't hook you, her expansive vocal range most certainly will. The Torrance, Calif., native's musical theater background shines through here; she exudes an array of emotions in a span of minutes on tracks like ""UP LATE"" and ""MARIA,"" making it impossible to look away. The orchestration, courtesy of her band (whom she calls ""The ill""), reflects the recorded sessions almost to a tee and features a special guest on bass and guitar: Tiny Desk alum Kelsey Gonzalez of The Free Nationals.

Sticking to the ""inspiration"" theme of our Black History Month celebration, she recites an excerpt from Langston Hughes's ""Let America Be America Again."" The 86-year-old words still read painfully relevant for many Black people in this country today.

3ZLP8QMVse8,2 Chainz: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

NPR Music's Tiny Desk series will celebrate Black History Month by featuring four weeks of Tiny Desk (home) concerts and playlists by Black artists spanning different genres and generations each week. The lineup includes both emerging and established artists who will be performing a Tiny Desk concert for the first time. This celebration highlights the beautiful cornucopia of Black music and our special way of presenting it. We hope you enjoy.

LaTesha Harris | February 17, 2021
""There are a lot of people who have been moving the needle forward for Black people. And they have been for some time,"" says an earnest, almost plaintive 2 Chainz. In a heart-filled sermon, he cites Martin Luther King Jr., Tyler Perry and Puffy as trailblazers, practicing gratitude for Black leaders who inspire him and the world at large. It's a sober moment of euphoria — and a drastic shift from the first 17 minutes of the Grammy winner's flashy Tiny Desk.

Colored in royalty, neon hues of lavender, fuchsia and violet, in his high-end nail studio Pamper (yes, he owns it, and he's not shy about letting you know), 2 Chainz is feeling himself throughout his five-song set. Getting a champagne-soaked pedicure, rolling one and periodically shouting out his sixth and latest studio album, So Help Me God!, the rapper exudes Black excellence in the way of luxurious comfortability. His unbridled braggadocio so clearly comes from the freedom of security after being denied opportunities, not just individually but generationally.

And he's worked for it. First coming up from Atlanta's hip-hop scene as one half of Playaz Circle, 2 Chainz landed a solo record deal and guest verses on Kanye West's ""Mercy"" and Nicki Minaj's ""Beez in the Trap'' in 2012. And, through guest verses and singles, his music's been dominating the charts ever since. For his Tiny Desk (home) concert, he rewinds the clock and samples that stacked discography (""Good Drank,"" ""I'm Different"") and performs three new hits (""Grey Area,"" ""Southside Hov,"" ""Vampire""). Alternating between earnest vulnerability and well-deserved conceit, 2 Chainz offers up his best: leaning into the dynamism of life and practicing gratitude.

Abby O'Neill | February 16, 2021
Rick Ross’ Tiny Desk takes place in the gallery space of Miami artist Rich B Caliente, The Boss’ longtime collaborator and friend. Even though the MIA street dignitary is now living in Atlanta, Ross insisted that his Tiny Desk (home) concert get captured in the city where his roots are anchored and where he rose to rap stardom. 

This Tiny Desk marks just the second time Ross has performed with a live band. On ""Super High,"" from his Teflon Don album, drummer Rashid Williams and bassist Thaddaeus Tribbett lay down the foundation for Ross’ smooth cadence and signature nonchalance. Background singer and Ne-Yo protege Troy Tyler projects the lead vocal lines originally sung by his mentor. 

Next, vocalist Elijah Blake steps up on Ross' smash hit ""B.M.F. (Blowin’ Money Fast) and “Aston Martin Music.” On the latter, Monty Reynolds drops in with the sparse, yet catchy key melody that made it the contagious hit single it was in 2010.

At one point, Ross pauses between songs to speak on his inspirations. ""So many inspired the Boss,” he says. “I could look at any brother on the street and get some inspiration from them, regardless of how many followers you got on social media, regardless of what you're riding in. I could learn something from you. I ain't scared to. Let's make sure we keep building.""

dh3MiwuLntA,GIVĒON: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"NPR Music's Tiny Desk series will celebrate Black History Month by featuring four weeks of Tiny Desk (home) concerts and playlists by Black artists spanning different genres and generations each week. The lineup includes both emerging and established artists who will be performing a Tiny Desk concert for the first time. This celebration highlights the beautiful cornucopia of Black music and our special way of presenting it. We hope you enjoy.

Sidney Madden | February 9, 2021
""Just bear with me while I just enjoy this and soak in it,"" GIVĒON admits with a laugh. Switching between the demeanors of a seasoned, nonchalant crooner and a giddy-grinned newbie, the fast-rising R&B star makes a point to show his humility during his long-awaited debut at Tiny Desk.

Accompanied by a minimal, masked-up band and only one background vocalist (a fellow Pisces at that), the baby-face baritone fills the set with resonance and light. He radiates gratitude with every note. Against a blue, moody backsplash of projected music video stills, GIVĒON notes the divine timing of this performance. ""Any moment to do this would be special,"" he says between songs, ""but I think Black History Month ... just celebrating Black culture for this month, I'm really excited to get to do this on this platform.""

Through the throes of the pandemic, GIVĒON has remained remarkably busy. In a span of eight months, the Long Beach, Calif. newcomer has released two solid EPs, the Grammy-nominated Take Time and When It's All Said And Done. (The latter included one of our favorite songs of 2020, ""Still Your Best."") For his Tiny Desk (home) concert, he borrows from each project to arrange a tantalizing 14-minute sampler — showing off just enough to get you to do your Googles and discover more.

Much like the moment he's trying to savor, GIVĒON's strength as a singer-songwriter is his ability to make his listener feel suspended in time. As fans quickly discovered on his breakthrough ""Chicago Freestyle"" feature last year, the peaks and valleys of GIVĒON's tone and the satisfying patterns of his runs don't just serenade; They immerse, they engulf. GIVĒON's star rising during a time of such sustained uncertainty is no accident, either. Between vulnerable storytelling and clear vocals, GIVĒON's work provides so many with what they're craving right now: intimacy and consistency.

Candles and books rest on a trunk at the bottom right corner of the wide shot. There, too, are special photographs of alto saxophonist Immanuel Wilkins with family in his childhood home in Philadelphia. ""One of the brightest things about this pandemic was going home to spend time with my mother, father and grandmother after being on the road for a while,"" Wilkins told NPR recently.

He also had time to meet up with his long time bandmates — Micah Thomas on piano, Daryl Johns on bass, Kweku Sumbry on drums —in Manhattan's Sear Sound studio to record this set. The quartet has been playing together for years, which is remarkable considering Wilkins is only 23 years old. In 2019, they recorded Wilkins' debut album, Omega, and released it last year to high acclaim. The project is all about Blackness, Black theory, the Black experience and the struggle and triumph that go with it all.

With a carefully crafted form and melody, ""Grace and Mercy"" is a lyrical story about peace, forgiveness and humility. ""Warriors"" is a driving, dynamic tune that conveys the shield of protection provided by our inner circles. ""The Dreamer"" is a tender piece that honors the Black writer and activist James Weldon Johnson and is based on his poem ""A Midday Dreamer."" The opening lines are played effortlessly on bass by Johns and when Wilkins joins in, his melodic saxophone exudes the rhythm of the poem's first stanza: ""I love to sit alone, and dream, and dream, and dream...""

vWQTzN_Nj1A,JLCO Septet with Wynton Marsalis: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"NPR Music's Tiny Desk series will celebrate Black History Month by featuring four weeks of Tiny Desk (home) concerts and playlists by Black artists spanning different genres and generations each week.

Suraya Mohamed | February 2, 2021
Wynton Marsalis and the Jazz At Lincoln Center Orchestra Septet recorded their Tiny Desk (home) concert at Dizzy's Club, or what they call ""the house of swing."" It begins with ""Sloganize, Patronize, Realize, Revolutionize (Black Lives Matters),"" a bold statement about humanity and the consequences of racism. Marsalis says this piece — as well as the rest of the music on his new album, The Democracy! Suite -- deals with the timeless human issues we see exacerbated during the times of the pandemic, like social challenges and matters of the heart.

""Deeper than Dreams"" is a reverential piece Marsalis wrote for those who have lost loved ones during the pandemic. Marsalis knows this kind of pain all too well; he lost his father, the legendary pianist and jazz patriarch, Ellis Marsalis, to complications from COVID-19 last spring, and speaks affectionately of ""the times when our old folks come and sit with us in the spirit realm when we are sleeping.""

To close, ""That Dance We Do (That You Love Too)"" is playful and funky and inspires a hopeful message, one that Marsalis says is ""for everybody who got out and got down during this time on behalf of freedom.""

Marsalis has been writing music about democracy and the call for justice for decades. ""I hope that the social and political corruption and turmoil of these times cast a light on the individual investment required to maintain a libertarian democracy,"" he wrote on his blog in January. ""May the events of these times inspire us all to engage even more deeply in the rights and responsibilities we have as citizens.""

Bob Boilen | January 29, 2021
Muzz are dear, old friends who make fuzzy, thoughtful songs. So when they gathered at Reade's Old Kingston Theater in New York's Hudson Valley after seven months of separation, minus hugs and wearing masks, I trust it was joyful but also kind of awkward.

Paul Banks and Josh Kaufman have known each other since childhood. You likely know Paul Banks as the singer for Interpol; Josh Kaufman is a producer and one-third of Bonny Light Horseman. They are both friends with drummer Matt Barrick, who played a Tiny Desk concert in 2012 with his band The Walkmen.

The songs here come from the trio's excellent self-titled debut album. Josh Kaufman told me via email that ""Paul was stuck in Glasgow and Matt and I were quarantining with families in Philadelphia and Brooklyn, respectively. At the very end of a long couple of days of rehearsal and taping, we — very late at night, Paul jet-lagged and the rest plain exhausted — stayed awake a little longer to try a campfire style strum along to some of the songs from our new LP. The result here is our Tiny Desk.""

W5-yezpcZNU,Miley Cyrus: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Miley Cyrus has always understood that music is theater. So it's no surprise that, visiting the imaginative space that is the Tiny Desk, she transforms it into something both fantastical and true to her topsy-turvy Mileyness.

Cyrus ruled preteen hearts on the small screen before mastering pop stardom's big stages, and throughout her career she's played with sound and image in unexpected and even controversial ways. And she's never balanced pop's glorious artifice with her own soulful authenticity more self-assuredly than she does on her latest album, the rock and roll manifesto Plastic Hearts.

Here, the scene opens with Cyrus, dressed head to toe in rock-star faux fur, in what looks like a teenage girl's bedroom. But the perspective in this pink-and-purple space feels a little ... odd. As Cyrus sings, it becomes clear that this is her Wonderland – like Alice full of magical cake, she's grown to exceed her surroundings. By the end of this three-song set, Cyrus reveals that it's the adolescent enclave that grew too small for her, not the other way around.

The songs Cyrus offers are as direct and affecting as the set is whimsical. Cyrus has lately proven herself one of pop's great interpretive vocalists, and she scores another triumph with her version of Mazzy Star's ""Fade Into You,"" a hazy psychedelic anthem that she infuses with just the edge of the next day's hangover. The two songs from Plastic Hearts that follow are her own bids at classic-rock timelessness. In ""Golden G-String"" Cyrus assesses her own life in the spotlight with Leonard Cohen-esque charm. And ""Prisoner"" is the power ballad that lets Cyrus really break out – as she leaves the tiny room — just a box, it turns out, on a soundstage – and joins her band, she's as free and self-confident as she's ever been.

dzgEjZyN9ec,Lous and The Yakuza: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bob Boilen | January 27, 2021
There's an elegant vibe as Lous and The Yakuza perform a Tiny Desk from the Book Bar in the Hôtel Grand Amour in Paris. And while the music is smooth, upbeat and warm, what lies beneath in Lous backstory, in her French lyrics, is, at times, deep and disturbing.

Lous — an anagram for ""soul"" — is Marie-Pierra Kakoma, a 24-year-old artist based in Belgium but born in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. She came to Belgium because her family escaped war in the Congo. They were refugees. For her Tiny Desk (home) concert, she opens with her 2019 single, ""Dilemme."" The song conjures up images of growing up in the Congo and Rwanda: ""Living haunts me, everything that surrounds me made me mean,"" she sings in French. Her songs are often set to Congolese rumba rhythms, filled with resilience, beauty and resistance.

These songs come from her 2020 album, Gore, and are steeped in a life that saw her mother imprisoned in the Congo for being Rwandan, then become separated during their escape to Belgium. They were eventually reunited, butLous was a troubled teen and spent a period of time adrift before pulling her life together in pursuit of music and art. There's much to uncover and discover here. This Tiny Desk (home) concert is a deep journey.

Abby O'Neill | January 26, 2021
These days it's nice to have an audience cheer you on, even if it's just the lighting crew. Burgeoning Jamaican soul singer Sevana and her six-piece band shot and recorded this Tiny Desk (home) concert at the Kingston Creative Hub back in September 2020 (the interludes you'll hear about the pandemic are reflective of that time). Sevana, a member of Protoje's In.Digg.Nation collective, showcases her vocal range by jumping delicately between traditional R&B, Caribbean gospel and soul, with touches of reggae interspersed.

Sevana was nervous for this shoot, but her humility and honesty shone through. On ""Blessed,"" an infectious ode about the miracle of life and faith, she welcomes us with open arms into her church and demonstrates the wide range of her multi-octave voice. She closes out the four-song set with her most recognizable tune, ""Mango,"" a dancehall-influenced love song. These Tropical percussive vibes are sure to send a surge of warmth and joy out to the masses, especially for all of those immersed in below-freezing temperatures in the dead of winter.

Now its four members are gathered not too far from their Baltimore base in Carroll Baldwin Memorial Hall, sans desk. ""We lost the desk,"" singer Sam Herring tells us with a smile. With drummer Michael Lowry on the tiny stage, the rest of the band — including bassist William Cashion and Gerrit Welmers on electronics — took to the floor, allowing Sam Herring to make his moves and sing his heart out. This music is clearly for the head and the feet.

The songs are from their sixth and very recent album, As Long As You Are. Along with themes of loneliness and love, we also hear songs about race, which is most evident in ""The Painter,"" a song about how we can all look at the same thing and see it so differently. We end with a song that came out shortly after visiting NPR in 2011 called ""Balance."" It's one of those tunes that feels repurposed for the 2020s: ""This is a song for anybody who's struggling through their lives,"" Sam Herring says, ""and I know there are a lot of you all out there, just trying to get by, but it's going to take a little bit more time.""

bpY060dYQgM,Rokia Traoré: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"Every January, I attend globalFEST at a New York City nightclub and see some of the most fantastic music I'll experience all year.

We called it Tiny Desk Meets globalFEST. We presented 16 artists in intimate settings (often behind desks donning globes), all hosted by African superstar Angélique Kidjo.

Rokia Traoré performed at globalFEST in 2005, the music festival's second year, and it's a thrill to present her meditative performance as part of Tiny Desk meets globalFEST. Her work is rooted in the Malian musical tradition, but defies the confines of a single culture. Born in Mali to a diplomat father, Traoré had a nomadic upbringing that exposed her to a wide variety of international musical influences. She joins us from Blues Faso, a theater inside her Foundation Passerelle in Mali, which she created to support emerging, interdisciplinary artists, from music and the performing arts to visual arts and photography.

From the basement of the Bowery Electric in downtown Manhattan, composer and vocalist Edwin Perez and his 10-piece band come together to put on a show. With a strong backbeat and enough room to move around, Perez's up-tempo energy brings the party and keeps it going. The theme of the night is salsa dura music, which originated in New York in the 1970s and gained acclaim thanks to acts like the Fania All-Stars and Spanish Harlem Orchestra.

Martha Redbone performs her Tiny Desk Meets globalFEST performance from her home studio in Brooklyn's Navy Yards. Native and African-American singer-songwriter Martha Redbone is known for her mix of folk, blues and gospel from her childhood in Harlan County, Ky., which she infuses with the eclectic grit of pre-gentrified Brooklyn. Inheriting the powerful vocal range of her gospel-singing African-American father and the resilient spirit of her mother's Cherokee, Shawnee and Choctaw culture, Redbone broadens the boundaries of American Roots music.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Tom Huizenga | January 22, 2021
There's a distinct dissonance between the bucolic setting of this lovely Max Richter Tiny Desk (home) concert and the reality he references after his performance.

""Looking forward to the time when gigs can come back and we can do this for real,"" the composer says, leaving us with a yearning that is borne out in his tranquil, probing music.

These half-dozen short pieces can offer two very different modes of experience. Shot in artful black and white, their simplicity and beauty invite us into a world as we once knew it, where fresh air wafts through open doors and dogs peacefully snooze (canine cameos by Evie and Haku) in the late summer sunshine in southern England.

On the other hand, the chaos found in the real world we know today can find a balm in Richter's soothing, oscillating figures in ""Infra 3"" or the gently swaying chords of ""Origins,"" where the music lumbers in the lower half of the keyboard.

There's a mysterious potency in instrumental music, where the mind is open to wander and free-associate. Max Richter taps into that power with singular grace and humanity.

Lyndsey McKenna | January 21, 2021
Sincerest apologies to Stefan Babcock's neighbors: For PUP's Tiny Desk (home) concert, the Toronto group refused to dial down the volume, filling Babcock's neatly-furnished living room – complete with an Ontario pennant – and just maybe making a few enemies down the street in the process.

""My neighbors hate us, and I don't blame them,"" Babcock said. Volume complaints aside, that admission feels like a perfect summary of the band's penchant for spinning stories of chaos into catchy-as-hell, shout-along songs. With bandmates Nestor Chumak, Zack Mykula and Steve Sladkowski masked to adhere to COVID safety protocol, PUP wastes no time here, immediately setting the tone with ""Rot"" from the group's aptly-titled 2020 EP, This Place Sucks A**. From there, the set spans the band's discography, spotlighting two cuts (""Kids"" and ""Scorpion Hill"") from 2019's Morbid Stuff and ""Reservoir,"" a track off the group's debut.

And to NPR officemates who think you've escaped an earsplitting in-office set with this (home) concert, let the handmade ""Ceci n'est pas une Tiny Desk"" (""This is not a Tiny Desk"") sign serve as a warning: When the Tiny Desk returns to NPR HQ and the U.S.-Canada border reopens, prepare to have your workday interrupted.

bMN99gLK424,Gabriel Garzón-Montano: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bobby Carter | January 19, 2021
If Gabriel Garzón-Montano's solo Tiny Desk back in 2017 was an exercise in restraint and vulnerability, his home set is the polar opposite. It beams ingenuity and unveils multiple layers, figuratively and literally. Taking advantage of of the rare opportunity to gather musicians in quarantine times, he says ""It's like being a child who's allowed to do what they always wanted to do when they didn't wanna get up for school, and it's also felt like an adult who didn't know what to do at 3 p.m. on a Tuesday afternoon. I'm focusing on oscillating between those states with ease.""

That sounds like the same approach he applied to his latest album, last year's genre-snubbing Agüita. In this performance he brought the full band, sporting all white from mask to toe and bringing to life all the sonics we hear on the record. Garzón-Montano morphs into three different characters from Agüita and stretches the boundaries even more, adding salsa flavor to ""Muñeca"" and delivering some bonus bars on the set opener, ""With A Smile.""

gUaAOpVvbVY,TH1RT3EN: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Abby O'Neill | January 18, 2021
TH1RT3EN, an irreverent and inflammatory new trio conceived by hip-hop star and lyrical savage Pharoahe Monch, has been in the works for five years. Co-conspirators include Daru Jones, a monster on the drums best known for his work with Jack White, and guitar mercenary Marcus Machado. Both the moniker and supergroup were born out of a frustration with the veneer of American society that underestimates the darkness of white supremacy.

""I knew 5 years ago where we headed,"" Monch shared over the phone. ""Sure, we've always done socially and politically aware music, but I'm tired of this ""love will win"" nonsense. Love may be the most powerful vibrating force, but consciousness is spreading and it's impossible not to be more aware of the evil that has kept the world in complete darkness. TH1RT3EN is the musical personification of me and my comrades at combat.""

Shot in a padded ""panic"" room, this Tiny Desk (home) concert reflects the rage felt by this three-man battalion of rhythm and verbal artillery, shattering genre boundaries in the process. While TH1RT3EN recorded this set in August 2020, as evidenced by Monch's interlude, this four-song set still channels the discontent outside our windows today.

Recording its set from France and Colombia, Labess blends flamenco and Gypsy jazz-influenced North African chaabi into energetic soul music with a nonstop beat.

Through his poetry, he proposes we reflect on cultural diversity and the necessity to unite, no matter our differences.

Recording its set from France and Colombia, Labess blends flamenco and Gypsy jazz-influenced North African chaabi into energetic soul music with a nonstop beat. Singing in Arabic, French and Spanish, lead vocalist Nedjim Bouizzoul mixes realism and hope, gentleness and fury, in stories about exile that illustrate the joys and the distress that pave the road from the native countries to new homes and back again. Through his poetry, he proposes we reflect on cultural diversity and the necessity to unite, no matter our differences.

UH1lce2Wzmc,mxmtoon: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

January 15, 2021 | Bob Boilen
""Hi, I'm mxmtoon, and I'm doing my Tiny Desk at the world's biggest desk!"" And so it begins, from an eerily empty New York City office building, mxmtoon sings songs filled with dreams and anxieties. Much of the music comes from her recent 2020 EPs, Dawn and Dusk. Those EPs included collaborations with Carly Rae Jepsen and Tune-Yards' Merrill Garbus. For this Tiny Desk (home) concert, her sweet voice and ukulele are accompanied by Nicole Wakabayashi on piano and Cale Hawkins on guitar.

It's been almost two years now since we first played the Oakland-based mxmtoon on All Songs Considered. She was just 18 then, singing about crying in her ""prom dress"" (which I'm thrilled she is performing here). Her melodies are simple, with the words up front mighty and personal. One of the first songs she released is called ""Feelings Are Fatal,"" which she also performs. It's a candid song about emotions and why we're often afraid to share them. It's a model for what mxmtoon does so well: humble, honest songs, sung here behind a massive desk.

PG3kd3_v6js,"Tiny Desk Meets globalFEST: Edwin Perez, Elisapie, Nora Brown, Rokia Traoré","January 14, 2021 | Bob Boilen
The Tiny Desk is teaming up with globalFEST this year for a thrilling virtual music festival: Tiny Desk Meets globalFEST. The online fest includes four nights of concerts featuring 16 bands from all over the world. From Monday, Jan. 11, through Thursday, Jan. 14, we'll be streaming new performances at 8 p.m. ET on NPR Music's YouTube channel and NPR.org.

Every January, I attend globalFEST at a New York City nightclub and see some of the most fantastic music I'll experience all year. Now, given the pandemic's challenges and the hardening of international borders, NPR Music and globalFEST is moving from the nightclub to your screen of choice and sharing this festival with the world. Each night, we'll present four artists in intimate settings (often behind desks donning globes), and it's all hosted by African superstar Angélique Kidjo, who performed at the inaugural edition of globalFEST in 2004.

For the final night of Tiny Desk Meets globalFEST, we have Edwin Perez's presentation of salsa dura, First Nations advocate and singer-songwriter Elisapie performing in Montreal, 15-year-old Appalachian banjo player Nora Brown, and globalFEST alum Rokia Traoré performing from Mali.

0:00 INTRO
2:26 EDWIN PEREZ
21:43 ELISAPIE
38:23 NORA BROWN
53:08 ROKIA TRAORÉ

Below you'll find short descriptions about each act, written by the globalFEST team.

EDWIN PEREZ
From the basement of the Bowery Electric in downtown Manhattan, composer and vocalist Edwin Perez and his 10-piece band come together to put on a show. With a strong backbeat and enough room to move around, Perez's up-tempo energy brings the party and keeps it going. The theme of the night is salsa dura music, which originated in New York in the 1970s and gained acclaim thanks to acts like the Fania All-Stars and Spanish Harlem Orchestra.

SET LIST
""La Salsa Que Me Crió""
""No Puedo Respirar"" (I Can't Breathe)
""Mi Tierra""

ELISAPIE
Elisapie returns to Tiny Desk for a show-stopping performance from Montreal, with the disco globe of our dreams helping to light her set. Elisapie, in both her songs and work, is a resounding advocate of First Nations culture in Canada. In her set, she harnesses an incredible energy with electrifying, emotive vocals.

SET LIST
""Qanniuguma""
""Wolves Don't Live by the Rules""
""Arnaq""

NORA BROWN
30 feet below the surface in Brooklyn, 10th grader Nora Brown brings incredible, surprising depth to the Appalachian music she plays. Over the course of her Tiny Desk Meets globalFEST concert, surrounded by innumerable globes and instruments, she infuses new life and energy into the traditional songs of Addie Graham, Virgil Anderson and Fred Cockerham. Nora weaves together songs and storytelling, speaking of the great history of the music that came before her and at which she excels.

SET LIST
""The Very Day I'm Gone""
""Miner's Dream""
""Little Satchel""

ROKIA TRAORÉ
Rokia Traoré performed at globalFEST in 2005, the music festival's second year, and it's a thrill to present her meditative performance as part of Tiny Desk meets globalFEST. Her work is rooted in the Malian musical tradition, but defies the confines of a single culture. Born in Mali to a diplomat father, Traoré had a nomadic upbringing that exposed her to a wide variety of international musical influences. She joins us from Blues Faso, a theater inside her Foundation Passerelle in Mali, which she created to support emerging, interdisciplinary artists, from music and the performing arts to visual arts and photography.

DEDICATED MEN OF ZION
Dedicated Men of Zion come to you from their backyard barbecue in North Carolina, bringing with them an electrified version of sacred Gospel soul music.

SET LIST
""Father, Guide Me, Teach Me""
""Can't Turn Me Around""
""It's A Shame""

LABESS
When we look at global arts, it's amazing to see how many traditions and nations can come together to make music together. Nowhere is that clearer than the music of Labess, an Algerian and Canadian band that is performing and recording their set from France and Colombia, proving that music has no boundaries even in times of isolation.
""Labess"" means ""everything is fine"" in Arabic, and their flamenco and Gypsy jazz-influenced North African chaabi (folk) music brings that message to life.

SOFIA REI
Recording from her apartment in Brooklyn, award-winning vocalist and songwriter Sofia Rei provides a concert that blends Argentinian and other South American folk traditions with experimental pop and electronic music.

We've had them in our spaces, so it's a real treat to see them in theirs, the Dakh Theater in Kyiv, where the band formed and where they've crafted their amazing catalogue of songs. Coming together, their performance maintains the energy and joy that define their music, bouncing off each other musically and emotionally.

KgrCYvVYSRE,Jazmine Sullivan: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bobby Carter | January 8, 2021
I don't recall any other artist at the Tiny Desk harmonizing their own introduction, but Philadelphia's own Jazmine Sullivan didn't waste a second, greeting us all by flexing those once-in-a-generation chops from the jump. The singer-songwriter, draped in a trench coat while her band sports all black, are nestled in the corner of a dimly lit space resembling a cabaret.

We don't see or hear much from Jazmine Sullivan until she has something to get off her chest. She drops a body of work every five years or so, shakes up the world of R&B with each offering, then quietly goes back to minding her own business. Her latest project, Heaux Tales, is a bold and timely conversation piece addressing truths regarding relationships, sex, social norms, self-worth and a myriad of other topics that women graple with. Each song is masterfully connected to another through unique yet familiar testimonies by women from all walks of life.

She starts her Tiny Desk (home) concert with three extended and reworked selections from Heaux Tales, squeezes in thee fan favorite from 2015's Reality Show, then invites Tiny Desk alum H.E.R. to the stage to close with ""Girl Like Me."" Ms. Sullivan, her background vocalists and H.E.R. ate this performance up and left not a crumb on the floor.

It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

January 6, 2021 | Bob Boilen
From a stunning room overlooking the San Gabriel Mountains in Pasadena, Calif., we hear the ethereal sounds of Active Child. ""I chose this space, as this is where I've written nearly every piece of music for my active child project. my music and this house / this view are completely intertwined.""

Active Child is the music of Patrick Grossi. For his Tiny Desk (home) concert, he layers his choral-styled voice on top of melodic harp and piano. Electronic beats propel selections from his latest album, In Another Life, as well as one of his earliest and well-known songs, ""Hanging On,"" that we featured on NPR Music back in 2011. Active Child makes music like no one else, and this Tiny Desk (home) concert is a perfect way to experience his music.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bob Boilen | January 5, 2021 
""Good afternoon humans, my name is Sevdaliza, you're very welcome on flight 808; our destination is Shabrang."" And so begins our elegant, ethereal journey. We hear an old reel-to-reel tape machine spinning some Brazilian bossa nova sounds, then shift to something more somber. Sevdaliza is seated, the tones are golden and brown, and her yearning voice sings, ""I am flesh, bones / I am skin, soul / I am human."" The song, ""Human,"" which casts away the notion of artists — particularly female artists — as products.

It's a defiant stand from this Iranian-born artist. Sevdaliza is an original, a truly creative soul. Her collaborators play delicate textures — electronic percussion, buzzing, swirling synth sounds, and cello and violin beautifully enhance texture and melody.

The home for this Tiny Desk (home) concert is a culturally significant bookstore and publishing house in Amsterdam called MENDO. Its warmth sets the tone for songs from Sevdaliza's album Shabrang. If you haven't heard her record, this is a perfect introduction to an album you shouldn't have missed in 2020.

Suraya Mohamed | December 21, 2020
It's Cory Henry's favorite time of the year, and the charismatic keyboardist has this wish for us all: ""May these songs fill you and your family with joy and happiness as we bring in what will be a far better year than the last. Live in love, live in peace, grow in freedom. Merry Christmas. Happy Holidays.""

Henry is a renowned composer, producer and musician who rose to fame as a member of Snarky Puppy. In 2018, he visited the actual Tiny Desk for a jubilant performance with his own band, Cory Henry and The Funk Apostles. Just a few weeks ago, he released a holiday album, Christmas With You, a collection of classics and new compositions full of comfort, joy and reflection. For this Tiny Desk (home) concert, Henry and his longtime collaborator, drummer TaRon Lockett, recorded a couple of those songs at the Gold—Diggers studio in Los Angeles.

In this cozy set, you'll hear ""Misty Christmas,"" the first of Henry's two inspiring compositions. Watch for his adorable pocket pitbull, Lady Lingus, right before he shifts to the organ with another soulful original, ""Christmas With You.""

1d24-TN19bQ,Jan Vogler And Alessio Bax: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

December 16, 2020 | Tom Huizenga
For this Tiny Desk (home) concert, we pay a visit to the doctor's office. Actually, the venue is called Rare Violins of New York and it's something of a second home to cellist Jan Vogler, who pops in frequently to have the experts give his 1708 Stradivarius cello a thorough checkup. If your multi-million-dollar fiddle has a cough or the sniffles, or even needs a full-blown restoration, Rare Violins, which sits just a block away from Carnegie Hall, can help. The firm also has a lovely music room, kitted out with a fine piano – something Vogler lacks at his place.

With help from the fine pianist Alessio Bax, Vogler makes a convincing case for Beethoven as one of the great heroes of the cello. Beethoven, whose 250th birthday falls this week, wrote five cello sonatas, plus other works for the instrument, which, before his time, was primarily relegated to beefing up the bass line in various chamber music situations.

Beethoven, in essence, liberated the cello. Listen to how it dances and struts in the opening scherzo from the Sonata in A, Op. 69, and how it sings sweetly in slow section from the 12 Variations on a Theme from Handel's Judas Maccabaeus, from early in the composer's career. And finally there's the opening to Beethoven's last cello sonata, which Bax — whose role is far more than just an accompanist here — says is compact with emotion, yet ""stretches the boundaries"" for the instrument.

SET LIST
Beethoven: Cello Sonata in A, Op. 69: II. Scherzo
Beethoven: 12 Variations on a Theme from Handel's Judas Maccabaeus: Variation XI: Adagio

8UdN8uWJRqM,Borromeo String Quartet: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Tom Huizenga | December 15, 2020
After the pandemic hit and musicians migrated online to share their performances, Nicholas Kitchen, the first violinist of the Borromeo String Quartet, built a little ""concert shell"" in his Boston-area loft he calls ""MusicKitchen."" It's a practice space for the group which he shares with his wife, the Borromeo's cellist Yeesun Kim. Like the shells in regular concert spaces, but on a tinier scale, the Kitchen shell (seen behind the players in this video) helps project the sound. And the sounds Kitchen wants to emphasize in this concert come by way of Beethoven, the composer born 250 years ago this week.

Beethoven doesn't score high when it comes to positive personality traits. Paranoid, litigious and a micromanager, Beethoven didn't suffer fools and often fought with friends. Still, he possessed a well-developed funny bone, which Nicholas Kitchen and company put on display here, along with their own whimsical tiny ""desks."" Because of the virus, and the confined space, the players wear masks.

The humorous side of Beethoven's personality seeps into his music, such as the false stops and musical giggles that fuel his two-minute-long Presto from the Quartet Op. 130, which opens this performance. For contrast, the Borromeos follow with a serious movement from later on in the same piece, the prayerful Cavatina, which Beethoven said even got him choked up. More hijinks ensue in the Vivace from the Quartet in F, Op. 135, where Kitchen says the music becomes ""completely berserk."" And finally, in the last movement of the same quartet, Beethoven inserts a musical inside joke, the brunt of which falls on a wealthy music lover who displeased the great composer by not showing up at an important concert.

Grumpy or gleeful, raging or reflective, Beethoven's music endures for everyone in these compelling performances.

SET LIST
Beethoven: String Quartet in B-flat, Op. 130, II. Presto
Beethoven: String Quartet in B-flat, Op. 130, V. Cavatina

99jaKJvtRBY,Jonathan Biss: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Tom Huizenga | December 14, 2020 
The pandemic has sidelined many big Beethoven birthday plans. Jonathan Biss was slated to play concerts around the globe in celebration of the 250th anniversary of the composer's birth. Instead, he's home in Philadelphia. So it's no surprise that for this all-Beethoven Tiny Desk concert, Biss chose music that explores the composer's own isolation, brought on by deafness and an uncompromising personality.Biss is uniquely qualified for the task at hand. The 40-year-old pianist has recorded all 32 of Beethoven's freewheeling sonatas, performed them worldwide and has taught an online course in the music.

That's impressive. Still, what's more astounding is the personal story behind Biss' obsession with Beethoven. The recording project alone took nearly 10 years and the things Biss says he gave up – relationships, even his sense of self – in order to live the dream is heartbreaking. The pandemic has shut down the life and livelihoods of many musicians, and for Biss the down time offered space to confront his relationship to Beethoven and his own demons.  He tells his story in a raw and insightful audio memoir called Unquiet: My Life with Beethoven to be released this week. It's the journey of an artist struggling with anxiety and solitude.

You can hear some of Beethoven's own struggle in these perceptive performances. The bittersweetness of the Bagatelle Op. 126, No. 1, the moments of fragility in the Sonata, Op. 90, and the interior perspective that reaches outward from the Sonata Op. 109, all prove that Beethoven's music is as meaningful today as ever.

SET LIST
Beethoven: Bagatelle in G, Op. 126, No. 1
Beethoven: Piano Sonata in E minor, Op. 90: I. Mit Lebhaftigkeit und durchaus mit Empfindung und Ausdruck

Robin Hilton | December 11, 2020
I've always found something comforting in the music of Ashley Ray. When I saw her in this Tiny Desk (home) concert, sitting on a screened-in porch with producer, songwriter and longtime friend Sean MConnell (and a distant chorus of crickets chirping in the early evening light), I realized why: Her songs sound like home. Love of family, the memories and traditions we share, tales of loving the past until it's time to let it go: They're all in her music, amplified by this setting, with beautiful, two-part harmonies and a couple of acoustic guitars.The three songs performed here – ""Pauline,"" ""Dirty Work"" and ""Just A House"" – are all from Ashley Ray's latest album, Pauline (No. 26 on our list of the 50 Best Albums Of 2020). It feels like a breakout release for this Kansas native, but she's been putting in the hard work for close to 20 years now, spending much of her time waiting tables while writing songs for better-known artists like Little Big Town, Lori McKenna and Ruston Kelly.  But her best and most affecting work to date arrived with Pauline, after she decided to open up and share her own deeply personal stories of love and loss. After living and trying to make it in Nashville the past couple of decades, it's a kind of homecoming for Ashley Ray, and she takes us with her.

ZknTE5DPlAA,Hayley Williams: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Dec. 9, 2020 | Lars Gotrich -- ""I've never done this without Paramore,"" Hayley Williams announces during her Tiny Desk (home) concert. For the first time in months, she's joined by a band, including friends and Tiny Desk alumnae Julien Baker and Becca Mancari. And from the moment the camera pans out of a literal tiny desk diorama, a jolt of energy leaps from Williams.

Petals for Armor is a soul-cleansing exhale from years of holding her breath. Originally released in a series of EPs, her solo debut sings through heartache in a tangle of triumph and hard-earned wisdom. It's a pop album that knows sadness can simmer, but also shout over an ever-shifting sonic palette. During the pandemic and protests, Williams has played these songs from her couch with muted restraint, and self-serenaded with acoustic covers — sad songs really can be sympathetic companions during dark days. 

But in her home, surrounded by blank canvases, Williams and friends splash a bottled-up energy. The joy is infectious, as ""Pure Love"" bursts from first bloom, ""Taken"" shows off Baker's jazzy-funk licks and Williams leans into the ""Dead Horse"" kiss-off with gleeful abandon.

Powerful sister duo Chloe x Halle went all out on this one. Flanked by personal memorabilia supplied by their mother, the Bailey sisters did their best to make this studio performance really feel like a home concert.

As they volley off each other, swapping lead and harmonies, it's amazing to watch how years of practice and innate genetic chemistry have them synced tighter than a SMPTE timecode. ""Baby Girl,"" the second song here, starts with notes reminiscent of Crystal Waters' ""Gypsy Woman (She's Homeless),"" and is preceded with Chloe sharing ""I know this year 2020 has been absolutely bonkers for all of us. For those moments where you kinda feel less than and you're not good enough ... that's why we wrote this song. ... Whatever happens, we'll be OK. And this is our world."" Fusing R&B, soul and pop, backed by a talented nine-piece female band, this performance is surely to delight Chloe x Halle's global fanbase.

TKfRm6uNx7I,Black Pumas: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Dec. 7, 2020 | Felix Contreras -- The Austin-based rock band Black Pumas is having a good 2020. The group, led by singer Eric Burton and guitarist Adrian Quesada, was just nominated for three Grammys, including album of the year for Black Pumas (Deluxe Edition), and both record of the year and best American roots performance for the track ""Colors."" The band's turn behind a tiny desk (and chair) shows why its debut album — now more than a year old — is receiving so much recognition right now.

Black Pumas' gritty, retro-soul groove is on full display, while the intensity level builds gradually throughout this four-song set. It's clear why the band's live shows have won over fans. From the opening strains of ""Red Rover,"" Burton digs deep and by the time we get to the ballad ""OCT 33,"" he's burning with old-school soul heartbreak.

Quesada's guitar is the perfect call-and-response foil, while the entire band — complete with two powerful back-up singers — calls to mind soul classics, but with a groovy new sheen.

I've seen some of Black Pumas' shows in recent years and the band gets better every time out. The power of this Tiny Desk (home) concert shows that they always bring it, no matter the size of the audience.

F4neLJQC1_E,Dua Lipa: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Dec. 4, 2020 | Abby O'Neill -- With a genuine smile stretched across her face, Dua Lipa seems overjoyed to reconnect with her band for their only performance since their tour in support of her sophomore album, Future Nostalgia, was cancelled in March. Glowing from the inside out and accentuated by the apricot hues of a backdrop in a London studio, Dua and her backup vocalists and band bring life and warmth into households in need of ""levitating"" and some pep in their step this winter. This vibrant four song set of dance hits, all from Future Nostalgia, will surely have you cutting up the floor in your kitchen while quarantining in the cold weather.

While we can't film our Tiny Desk concerts at NPR's D.C. office during the pandemic, our ""home"" series has created opportunity for global megastars like Dua Lipa to bring her uptempo dance joints all the way from London. Of Kosovar Albanian descent, Dua Lipa was raised in the UK and rose to super stardom in the three years since her eponymous debut album dropped in 2017. NPR Music featured her in our docu-series Noteworthy at the onset of her career. It's been extraordinary to witness her colossal takeover of the pop music landscape. Dua sums the times during her intro of ""Love Again"": ""It's about manifesting good things into your life, when things aren't quite going your way.""

YyK2H0G4jrE,PJ Morton: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.



Bobby Carter | December 2, 2020

If we invite artists to return to the Tiny Desk, we ask that they do something completely different from their first show. For PJ Morton, the obvious shift would've been to come solo. After all, he defied the laws of space back in 2018 and managed to squeeze 14 bodies behind the Desk. This time around he's just as generous with the spotlight, but puts a new focus on gospel.


Gathered in a big airy space in his hometown of New Orleans, PJ and his band performed three selections from the now Grammy-nominated The Gospel According To PJ, his very first gospel album. He grew up playing gospel music, but chose secular music as his professional path. The album brings him back full circle, a journey mapped out in conversations on the album with his father, Bishop Paul S. Morton.
PJ only sings lead on one song but is clearly the maestro for this Tiny Desk (home) concert. They open with the reggae-infused ""So In Love,"" featuring Darrel Walls and Zacardi Cortez and close with ""Repay You,"" featuring J Moss. I think we could all use a little praise music as we round out 2020 and who better to offer it than the preacher's son, Paul Morton, Jr.?

pyJsiO6SbAY,Julia Bullock: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Tom Huizenga | December 1, 2020
Soprano Julia Bullock prefers to be called a ""classical singer."" It's a rather humble, even vague, appellation for one of today's smartest, most arresting vocalists in any genre.

She was just named Artist of the Year by Musical America, who labeled her an ""agent of change."" Bullock, who also considers herself an activist, has shaken up the classical music world recently with provocative programming and expressive performances. You can witness just that in this extraordinary Tiny Desk (home) concert from Munich, Germany with pianist and conductor Christian Reif, whose sensitive playing seems to anticipate and enhance Bullock's every phrase. He also happens to be her husband.

Carefully choosing songs in German and English, Bullock begins with something bittersweet and introspective by Franz Schubert that cautions patience when looking for inner peace. She follows with ""Wie lange noch"" (How Much Longer), a World War II-era song by Kurt Weill. Written after Weill emigrated to the United States, the song contained coded messages for Germans back home. But Bullock has no time for secrets in these days fraught with uncertainty. The meaning behind her insistent cries of ""How much longer?"" as she stares straight through the camera, couldn't be more transparent.

The next two songs are a gut-punch of clear-eyed observation, struggle and hope. The spiritual ""City of Heaven"" finds a determined protagonist facing down sorrow, while Billy Taylor's ""I Wish I Knew How it Would Feel to be Free,"" written at the height of the civil rights movement, speaks truth to power. At the very end, Bullock spins out a long flowing line on the word ""free."" It's among the most transcendent musical moments I've experienced this year.

Franz Schubert: ""Wanderers Nachtlied II""

Bobby Carter | November 30, 2020
""Tiny Desk! We finally made it!"" exclaimed singer-songwriter Mac Ayres as he finished his opening number, ""She Won't Stay Long."" I'm sure his fans will especially feel that sentiment since they've made a home in our social media feeds and YouTube comments for years now. We were well on the way to hosting Mac Ayres at our D.C. offices until we had to shut down and pivot. As we worked our way through the adjustment to Tiny Desk (home) concerts, he also needed some time to regroup.

The 23-year-old Long Island native shot this in his basement back in September (hence the 'register to vote' comment). Mac's modus operandi lends itself to the Tiny Desk naturally. No over-produced beats, lots of live instruments and a stunning vocal range — and he handles all duties: guitar, bass, keyboard and background harmonies for three songs from previous albums and the premiere of a new song, ""Sometimes."" Wow.

iZZv2BDtP50,Latto: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Sidney Madden | November 25, 2020

If 2020 has taught me one lesson, it’s this: “Don’t wait on what’s yours. Just go get it.” At 21, Atlanta’s record-setting fresh face Mulatto has spent her entire year embodying that lesson. 
 
With her debut album, Queen Of Da Souf, and a relentless run of features, Big Latto has stamped her flag in hip-hop’s most influential city at a crucial moment. At a time when women in hip-hop are running laps around the guys without so much as shifting their lace fronts, Latto is finding her footing in the new rap canon with Gold-charting singles, standout freestyles, and cosigns from the likes of Nicki Minaj, Gucci Mane and Trina. 

As the inaugural winner of the Lifetime reality show The Rap Game and someone who's made music since the age of 10, the personality that Latto brings to her bars is goofy, assertive and steadfast: She chose her stage moniker to purposely flip the derogatory term she was teased with as a child on its head and uses social media hate to fuel her music. 

With her burgeoning success coinciding with a global pandemic, Latto’s found herself more comfortable in the studio than ever this year. Her Tiny Desk debut is a dispatch from her Queen Of Da Souf throne in Doppler Studios, right next to her crown. 
 
Latto rocks an aqua wig and raps perched from her throne while her violinist Joy Black and keyboardist SK go berserk on “Youngest N Richest.” It’s not until “He Say She Say” when Latto rises up from her seat to put extra emphasis behind this reminder: “Self-made b****, hell you talkin 'bout? / Yea, I got it out the mud, no handout.”

T8o7k1GCM0c,Don Bryant: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Lauren Onkey | November 24, 2020

Classic soul music feels best in a club, with a lead singer and big band, preferably with horns, playing off the excitement of a sweaty crowd, drawing them in to stories of love, or love lost, or love reclaimed. It's a hard feeling to find in our pandemic times.

In his Tiny Desk (home) concert, soul legend Don Bryant brings us there, with just a keyboard, a guitar player and an otherwise empty room. Wearing an elegant black and grey jacket matching his salt-and-pepper hair, Bryant evokes style and experience – someone who has been in it for the long haul.


Bryant, almost 80, has been in the music business since the early days of rock and roll; he wrote his first hit, the Five Royales' ""I Got to Know,"" in 1960. He went on to his biggest success as a songwriter for Hi Records in Memphis, home of Al Green, Ann Peebles (with whom he wrote ""I Can't Stand the Rain"") and Otis Clay. For a number of years he only recorded gospel music, until 2017 when he began releasing soul records again, backed by members of the Bo-Keys.


All of that history stands behind this performance, featuring three songs from his latest record, You Make Me Feel, all written by him. His voice is powerful and resonant, deeply rooted in gospel. The stripped-down band includes just the right players: Scott Bomer, who produced the album and is a member of the Bo-Keys, holds it down on percussive guitar, and Archie ""Hubbie"" Turner, a member of the rhythm section of Hi Records during its '70s heyday, is a master on the keyboards, locked in tight to Bryant's expressive vocals. It's a reminder that soul music really just needs a voice and a human story. We're lucky that Don Bryant is still at it, and at such a level.

Suraya Mohamed | November 23, 2020
Recorded in his hometown of Detroit, KEM's Tiny Desk performance is light, welcoming and beautifully decorated. So is his music. After almost 20 years of recording R&B hits like ""I Can't Stop Loving You"" and ""Love Calls,"" he still comforts my soul with his sultry voice and simple, yet satisfying melodies.

Fans have been waiting since 2014 for a new album and it finally dropped earlier this year. Love Always Wins is filled with his signature romantic style. With accompaniments by veteran musicians, Michael ""Nomad"" Ripoll on guitar and David McMurray on saxophone, we get to hear three songs from the album in this lovely set.

The first, ""Friend Today,"" poignantly articulates a love for our fellow humans: ""There's a roll like thunder / They killing our babies, Lord / They headed straight for the border / And we can no longer ignore it."" KEM wrote ""Not Before You,"" a classic romantic love song, as a dedication to his wife, Erica. ""Lonely"" ends the set with an upbeat, hopeful vibe: ""There's a life waiting for you / In your brokenness."" It's an affirmation that personal struggles can end in true happiness.

Bob Boilen | November 18, 2020
For her Tiny Desk (home) concert, Adrianne Lenker's home is a camper trailer parked somewhere in Joshua Tree National Park. It's the appropriate setting for the five songs she performs from her new album, tunes birthed in a wooden cabin in Massachusetts.

The songs, the words, the voice of Adrianne Lenker has been at the top of my year-end musical loves for the past five years, more so than any other artist. It began with her work as the singer and songwriter on Big Thief's electric debut album, Masterpiece, in 2016 and runs through this year's two sister solo albums, one titled songs and the other instrumentals. Those albums contain nothing more than an acoustic guitar, voice, and the bug, birds, and creatures captured while recording.

Her yearning voice, simultaneously frail and strong, draws me to those songs — songs about people, everyday life, everyday death, and ordinary places. All the while, she picks the tunes out of her guitar or paints the rhythms with a brush. These are songs worth spending time with, simple on first listen, but so much more profound once you live with them.

Bob Boilen | November 17, 2020
The Tiny Desk challenges artists to think outside their usual box. When they play my NPR desk, we don't amplify the singer's voice into the room, resulting in a more vulnerable sound. For their Tiny Desk (home) concert, the singer, musician and composer Owen Pallett did something different, but just as unusual. Owen recorded four songs in multiple stages on different instruments: first, they played acoustic guitar and sang; then they performed the songs again, but this time on violin and viola; finally, Owen layered the recordings in post-production, not really knowing what the final versions would sound like. They explain the whole process, charmingly, between songs. 
From a bedroom in Toronto, Owen traverses their musical history, opening with a dreamy song from 2005’s debut album (as Final Fantasy), Has a Good Home, before moving on to a Beirut song he helped write, ""Cliquot,"" from that band’s 2007 album. “Perseverance of the Saints"" is from Owen’s latest record, Island. Here it's transformed from arpeggiated piano to guitar, and I love the tone it sets. 
Owen not only performed each instrument in separate takes, but also did all the production work: recording, filming and editing.  A remarkable talent captured in a candlelit bedroom.

Tom Huizenga | November 13, 2020 
Since 2008, we've invited almost 1,000 musicians to come to NPR headquarters in Washington, D.C., to play songs beside a desk that belongs to my colleague Bob Boilen. Since the pandemic hit, artists have been getting creative incorporating their own desks, and other makeshift setups, into Tiny Desk ""home"" concerts.

But the desk – and the home setup – for this performance beats them all. The location is the home, and not so tiny writing desk, of Aaron Copland, America's beloved composer.

Copland, who would have turned 120 on Nov. 14, gave us Appalachian Spring, Fanfare for the Common Man and Rodeo, among many other works that helped define a singular American sound. The set begins with one of the composer's earliest pieces in a jazzy vein, while the Violin Sonata that follows embodies America's wide open spaces, filled with possibilities. The Duo for flute and piano, which closes the set and features the great flutist Carol Wincenc, was actually written at the very desk seen in this video.

Michael Boriskin plays Copland's own piano. He's the artistic and executive director of Copland House, located an hour north of New York City in the lower Hudson River Valley. What was once Copland's home is now a creative center for American music.

Copland's music from Copland's own desk – what could be more authentic than that?

PSgPYBn4yyE,Tigran Hamasyan: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Suraya Mohamed | November 11, 2020
Pianist Tigran Hamasyan settled down in his home country of Armenia during the pandemic, and took the opportunity to catch up on projects that have been lingering, unfinished, for years. For a touring musician, it's one of the few benefits of the COVID-19 lockdown, having the time to get things done and engage with new work.

Tigran first wowed me in 2006. Earlier that year, he'd won the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Competition and his performance at the John F. Kennedy Center For The Performing Arts for NPR's annual Jazz Piano Christmas program was truly memorable. I've been following him and his robust discography ever since.

The first performance in his Tiny Desk (home) concert, ""Road Song,"" features a melody Hamasyan wrote in 2008, but recorded with a quintet on his imaginative 2013 album, Shadow Theater. He frequently plays a solo version of it live, but had never played it alone in a studio until now. That's followed by ""Our Film,"" from Hamasyan's latest and most enterprising release, The Call Within. This performance mirrors the intensity and sentimentality of the album version, but here it's more intimate and fanciful. The last tune, ""A Fable,"" is the title track of his 2011 solo album, which was inspired by 13th century Armenian writer Vardan Aygektsi.

n8SdsHsiZ7k,Shirley Collins: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future.

Bob Boilen | November 10, 2020
Shirley Collins is a legend — a humble one, but undoubtedly a transformative voice in traditional folk music. It's truly a miracle to hear her voice at this Tiny Desk (home) concert. At 85, Shirley Collins is seated in the living room of her cottage in Lewes, East Sussex, accompanied by guitarist Ian Kearey. Her life story took the sort of twists you hear in the songs she sings, in her case, a broken heart, a painful divorce, and the loss of her voice. For 30 years, she couldn't sing.
Now, here she is playing songs from Heart's Ease, only the second album she's made in the past 40 years. You hear her sing of a young sailor boy who saves his ship from robbers and is promised by his captain both gold and his daughter's hand in marriage. The lad sinks the robber's boat, only to be left to drown by that very same captain.

These unimaginable tales and that unadorned voice have influenced both British and American folk music since the 1960s, from Fairport Convention's Sandy Denny to The Decemberists' Colin Meloy. These tales of woe and whimsy are as timeless as Shirley Collins.

bnbJCEBGvHU,Mickey Guyton: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Ann Powers | November 9. 2020
Mickey Guyton recorded her three-song Tiny Desk (home) concert in a warm-hued corner of a friend’s studio near her Los Angeles home. Her makeshift desk holds the book that inspired its title, alongside a pair of blue baby booties: Guyton will soon give birth to her first child. Albums by Whitney Houston and Patsy Cline -- Guyton’s guardian angels -- rest on the window ledge. The hands of keyboardist Lynette Williams, who also plays in Childish Gambino’s band, are the first sight you see as the music starts. This is country: soulful keyboards, the Afro-Caribbean instruments of percussionist Paul Allen, Jon Sosin’s acoustic guitar. Guyton raises the rafters and distills emotion with impeccable clarity. Her high notes thrill, her nuance in storytelling captivates. A star for our times claims her place.
America is living through a moment of change, and it’s difficult to imagine a better artist to greet it than Guyton. The Texas native has long been a favorite of country music connoisseurs for her lucid songwriting style and the dazzling dynamic range and power of her voice. And yet, it took Guyton nearly a decade to be fully embraced within the country world she loves. This year is her year. In February, as protests against sexism intensified in the country world, she debuted “What Are You Gonna Tell Her” and it caused an instant sensation. In June, after the killing of George Floyd, Guyton released “Black Like Me,” which tells her own story in a way that gently but resolutely calls for change. Suddenly Guyton was an emblem. What matters most is that she is a great singer and writer redefining country music’s sound, as well as its image. That’s what she makes undeniably clear here.

Abby O'Neill | November 6, 2020
Ascending R&B talent Tiana Major9 welcomes us into her South London home with a band she assembled for her Tiny Desk (home) concert. Tiana gained the music world’s attention in August when Adele took to Instagram to call the song “Same Space?” “absolutely stunning!!” (The post was liked more than 430,000 times.) I was lucky enough to witness a private Tiana showcase in Los Angeles several months earlier, where I was moved by the refined nature of her voice.

She begins her Tiny Desk with an ending of sorts: the devastating “Collide,” written for the final sequence of Lena Waithe’s critically acclaimed film Queen & Slim. Later, she shows off her range and timbre on “Think About You,” a stunning love song that infuses elements of jazz, alternative R&B and her Jamaican roots. The sweetness in its refrain “I need more hours in the day … just to think about you” feels like a blueprint for how to spend the third wave of quarantine.

The backdrop for Polo G's Tiny Desk (home) concert is a nod to his deep love for the game of basketball. He and his band perform in Los Angeles Lakers jerseys on an outside court in California, with Polo G repping one of the greatest Lakers, Magic Johnson.

The man born Taurus Bartlett has achieved quite a bit for a relative newcomer in hip-hop. This summer he was selected for XXL's popular Freshman Class cover. His second LP, The Goat, debuted at No. 2 on Billboard's Hot 200 and spawned two platinum-certified singles, including the braggadocious ""Flex"" that kicks off his Tiny Desk.

Polo G's eyes are hidden behind his hair for the majority of his performance, but as he sings ""I'm so sick of farewells and RIPs"" on his latest single, ""Epidemic,"" it becomes clear that this 21-year-old Chicago emcee is going through a lot. I found it refreshing to hear a rapper normally backed by beats bare his ""heart and soul"" with a live band.

It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Lars Gotrich | October 30, 2020
""We weren't sure what to wear and the only thing we could agree on was devil costumes."" In a pink wig, blue horns and a purple cheerleading outfit, Sadie Dupuis brings a brightly ghoulish spirit to her Tiny Desk (home) concert, just in time for Halloween. 


Haunted Painting, her terrific new album as Sad13, is, in part, about metaphorical and literal ghosts: their weight and place in your life, but blasted with the sonic glee of a neon rainbow. While Dupuis' guitar unmistakably squiggles with a vocal vibrato to match, Sad13's pop sensibility differentiates from her other band, Speedy Ortiz; these sweet-and-sour songs explode with creative arrangements and nerdy production techniques.


Recording separately from their homes in Philly, New York and Stamford, Conn., Sad13 (featuring drummer Zoë Brecher and bassist Audrey Zee Whitesides) doesn't so much slim down the wild details but finds different textures in these songs. ""Hysterical,"" in particular, leans into a fuzzy space-age boogie, as Dupuis hooks up her Farfisa organ to an array of effects pedals, sounding like one of Joe Meek's idiosyncratic productions from the 1960s. 


Sad13's set ends with ""Take Care,"" a song that beautifully blossoms from grief. ""It's about caring for and missing people to an extent that's detrimental to your own well-being,"" she shares as cellist Sasha Ono and violinist Camellia Hartman take their virtual places. ""I think, as we're all secluded and cloistered away from the people we care about, this one's been resonating harder with me than it did when I recorded it.""

Y_-I2y1YPsM,Ty Dolla $ign: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bobby Carter | October 28, 2020 
Superstar songwriter Ty Dolla $ign has too much history with NPR Music and too many hits under his belt to deliver us just any ol' Tiny Desk from home. He assembled a roster of frequent collaborators (including Skrillex) under one roof to perform some jams from his new album, aptly titled Featuring Ty Dolla $ign, as well as a few of his chart-topping singles.

While many know Ty as pop's go-to feature artist, the Los Angeles native has steadily crafted his own diverse catalog, with more than a dozen albums, mixtapes and EPs to his name. With Featuring, he flips the script, roping A-list pop stars — like Post Malone, Nicki Minaj, Future and Young Thug — into his own world, using them to define the Ty Dolla sound.

This Tiny Desk (home) concert was a long time coming. Ty visited the NPR Music offices last year, where he performed an emotional tribute to Mac Miller, and it's something we'll never forget, but he wanted to start fresh and focus on the music of Featuring. Fast forward more than a year later, and we finally have that full-length Ty concert so many of you have been asking for.

1jUVHWe09GQ,"GroundUP Music with Becca Stevens, Bokanté, Alina Engibaryan And More: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert","The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Suraya Mohamed, Colin Marshall | October 27, 2020
This three-act, 18-person Tiny Desk (home) concert was conceived by Michael League, Snarky Puppy's composer and bandleader. He and his cadre of artists on the GroundUP record label believe in two important points: that music and politics are inextricably linked, and the best way to connect people is through song.

League's rolodex is impressive. If you're a jazz fan, you're almost certain to know many of the performers in this ambitious Tiny Desk, which includes (among others) Grammy winners Gregory Porter, Brad Mehldau and Chris Potter.

The concert features three distinct ensembles, beginning with Becca Stevens and her song ""Heather's Letters To Her Mother."" ""I wrote this for Heather Heyer, who was killed on August 12, 2017, while peacefully protesting the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville,"" she says. ""In my heart this song has always been a rallying cry to come from a place of compassion in our actions and reactions. It's a reminder to continue the fight for equality from a determined and compassionate stance regardless of what is happening around us. And it's a reminder to stay grounded in love because without a foundation of love we are truly lost.""

The second song features League's world music group Bokanté performing the Creole song ""Réparasyon,"" meaning ""reparations."" Bokanté vocalist Malika Tirolien wrote the song, which appears on the band's Grammy-nominated album What Heat. ""With the rise of black liberation movements around the world, this is a crucial time to remind everyone that people of African descent need the slave trade officially recognized as a crime against humanity and need reparations and restitutions of stolen goods,"" Tirolien says. ""Getting justice is the only way we can begin a process of forgiveness and healing.""

Keyboard player and vocalist Alina Engibaryan leads the last song, ""We Are,"" which strives to bring people together, ""I wanted to write a song that has a message about people, where regardless of our beliefs, our political views, our race, color, we are all human beings and made of the same thing,"" Engibaryan says. ""I hope people will understand that one day and will learn to love, respect and accept one another.""

QDJWmG7d0AM,Katie Pruitt: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Ann Powers | October 26, 2020
Katie Pruitt's voice is like a kite soaring through the sky of her songs. Just listen to how it catches the wind in the song that opens her Tiny Desk (home) concert, the title track from her captivating debut, Expectations. ""Sometimes I can't get outta my own head,"" Pruitt begins in a wry monotone that embodies the low mood she's describing. But phrase by phrase, Pruitt builds self-confidence until, by the end, she's fully aloft. Pruitt rides the high of her own chorus without histrionics. Here's an exceptional musician and songwriter who never feels the need to show off.

Throughout this three-song set, recorded in the plant-strewn corner of Nashville's Minutia studio where Expectations was tracked, Pruitt and her two bandmates maintain this tone of steady excellence. She's playing with local treasures Zachariah Witcher on bass and Ross McReynolds on drums, and the trio locks in from the first note, building a cool rock groove as Pruitt unspools her stories. ""It's been a hard year,"" she says. ""But one thing about painful experiences is that ... it forces you to grow."" Expectations offers myriad scenes of such transformation, documenting Pruitt's journey from a Southern Catholic childhood to adulthood as an out lesbian who, as she sings in ""Loving Her,"" is ""staying true to who I am."" That song and the heartbreak waltz ""Out of the Blue,"" which completes this set, demonstrate Pruitt's gift: making her particular experiences universally relatable. Like her ace guitar work and that muscular yet weightless voice, these songs inspire with their easy largesse. ""Love each other, love yourself, wear a mask!"" Pruitt says by way of goodbye, her smile saying, I know you can.

It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

October 23, 2020 | Bobby Carter -- The setlist for Spillage Village's Tiny Desk (home) concert reminds me of the bouts of pessimism and jolts of optimism I've had of late. Opening with the dreary, apocalyptic ""End of Daze,"" leaping into titles like ""Hapi"" and ""Jupiter,"" feels all too applicable in 2020.

The Atlanta collective consists of Dreamville records standouts J.I.D and EARTHGANG along with Jurdan Bryant, Hollywood JB, Benji and Tiny Desk alumnus Mereba. R&B star 6lack, also a member of the group, was unable to make it to the shoot due to travel restrictions. Spillage Village began working on its latest album, Spilligion, in direct response to the unpredictable chaos the world has faced since March. J.I.D told Rolling Stone that he originally rented a house to begin recording his third solo album with collaborations, but that the heavy topics of the pandemic and social justice led to music that was bigger than any one artist.

The underlying theme throughout Spilligion is spirituality, so when they floated the idea of filming in a church I knew that if they couldn't perform behind the desk, this was the perfect alternative.

Bob Boilen | October 21, 2020
It's been 15 years since the legendary guitarist Leo Kottke put out a new recording, and it's no coincidence that his new music is with Phish bassist Mike Gordon. The two have a history of making albums together, but that hit a hiatus in 2005 with their Sixty Six Steps project. They're back with a 2020 album, Noon, and Phish drummer Jon Fishman joins the duo. And while they're miles apart for this Tiny Desk (home) concert, Leo at Creation Audio in Minneapolis and Mike and Jon at Tank Recording Studio in Burlington, Vt., there's plenty of humor and spirit traversing the wires.

They begin with what fans of Leo Kottke fell in love with 50 years ago, the sound of his acoustic guitar fingerpicking. Mike Gordon punctuates the opening song ""Flat Top,"" which at moments feels like a musical chase. Jon Fishman is a tasteful addition. Mike and Jon have played over 2,000 shows together, so there's telepathy there. Still, he also finds ways into the music that isn't merely rhythmic; he adds aural atmospherics with brushes in hand. There are some fun visual tricks but — musically speaking — not a moment of trickery. Just pure magic.

By Abby O'Neill | October 20, 2020
Christone ""Kingfish"" Ingram made his Tiny Desk debut in 2018 at age 19, flashing brilliance while backing hip-hop icon Rakim. Since then, this Grammy-nominated singer and guitarist from Clarksdale, Miss., has risen to critical acclaim and packed venues across the nation. Kingfish blends Delta Blues with contemporary melodies that resonate with blues lovers new and old. Evocative of mentor and collaborator Buddy Guy's signature hammer-on technique, the 21-year-old Kingfish ferries this treasured genre of the American musical tradition to contemporary audiences. His Tiny Desk (home) concert was shot at Ground Zero Blues Club in Clarksdale with bassist Paul Rogers.

6_tzgvTDNds,Gracie and Rachel: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future.

Bob Boilen | October 19, 2020
Gracie and Rachel are perfect musical mates. Their styles conjure contrast, with Gracie Coates' more pop-leaning keyboard melodies alongside Rachel Ruggles' classical background. They've been honing their orchestral pop sound since high school. These days they share space in a NYC apartment and are grateful to be able to ""commute from their bedrooms"" at a time when so many collaborators can't be together.

The duo made one of my favorite records of 2017, and they've just released their second album, Hello Weakness, You Make Me Strong. The title of the album reflects their positive attitude despite angst. The lyrics to ""Ideas"" highlights that attitude by encouraging us to dig inside ourselves and discover our creative spirit"" ""So take your little ideas / Make them a little bit stronger / Throw out the ones you can't / You don't need them any longer.""

The duo made much of this music in the past year and a half, in the very room they're performing this Tiny Desk (home) concert. It's a beautiful portrait in black and white and — if you're new to Gracie and Rachel — a welcoming introduction. I've seen them in concert, including alongside Ani DiFranco, who released this album on her label Righteous Babe. I look forward to the day they can leave their space and perform these songs in a venue; for now, put on a good set of headphones and listen to their message of positivity.

iK1uBBv83M0,Ozuna: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

In celebration of National Hispanic Heritage Month, NPR Music presents four very special Tiny Desk Home Concerts recorded especially for this week. This video from global superstar Ozuna is a world premiere.

Oct. 16, 2020 | Stefanie Fernández -- From a verdant room tucked away in Miami, Ozuna's Tiny Desk performance might allow you, as it did me, to forget for a moment that he's one of the most watched and listened-to artists on earth. For someone whose work often operates at galactic proportions, this performance of five songs makes room for Ozuna's sweet tenor to take center-desk in a love letter to the global communities that supported and streamed him to god tier status.

The Puerto Rican singer kicks it off with a breezy rendition of ""Caramelo"" that leads into a solo version of the sun-drenched ""Del Mar"" from ENOC, his fourth album that he's deemed a return to his roots. This pared-down performance makes good on that promise, reworking star-studded collaborations, like the ballad ""Despeinada,"" as they should be sung: languorously and with intimacy. Even the pop smash ""Taki Taki"" sounds brand new, buoyed by his alchemical flow and energy.

Ozuna is a crown jewel in the global crest of Latin pop, a movement whose modern success in reggaeton and Latin trap is indebted to the Caribbean genres Ozuna heard growing up in Puerto Rico, sounds like old-school reggaeton and reggae en español, dembow, dancehall and more. From then to now, Ozuna's bare talent remains his greatest asset. It's rare to see a star of his magnitude brush the earth so closely, and when it does, it's even rarer for it to feel and sound like second nature.

When we invited Brazilian vocalist Bebel Gilberto to do a Tiny Desk (home) concert, we had no idea her home would have a spectacular view of speed boats gliding across the bay in Rio de Janeiro just beneath historic Sugarloaf Mountain. But those iconic sights are in fact the perfect visual backdrop for Brazilian music, and Gilberto's in particular.

Bebel Gilberto is, of course, the daughter of one of the creators of bossa nova, João Gilberto. But as she slinks into the subtle electronic samba of ""Cliché,"" from her new album Agora, it becomes clear why she is now a standard bearer of Brazilian music. During this concert, she is accompanied by Chico Brown, the son of famed musician Carlinhos Brown and grandson of the legendary Chico Buarque.

You can feel the presence of all of that Brazilian musical royalty in one of Bebel Gilberto's most popular songs, the closing ""Aganjú.""

Felix Contreras | October 14, 2020
Vocalist Carlos Vives kicks things off in high gear on this Tiny Desk (home) concert with his trademark sound: a celebration of the music from his beloved home country of Colombia, mixed with rock and other Latin music style.

Spirited champeta dance grooves from the country’s Pacific coast permeate his classic 1995 hit “Pa’ Mayte,” and if you look closely you’ll see two of his backup vocalists also playing traditional gaitas Colombianas (flutes). They are used to spectacular effect as a transition between the title cut of his new album Colombiana and “La Bicicleta” (originally recorded with his compatriot Shakira), a vallenato fueled by a bit of reggaeton.

Presenting Carlos Vives has special resonance this week as his latest album recently picked up six Latin Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year.

Felicidades, Carlitos! And oye, adding that NPR coffee mug to your desk? Nice touch!

Felix Contreras | October 13, 2020
Colombian vocalist Lido Pimienta has had one of the musical highlights of a year marked by tragedy and uncertainty. The healing magic of her album Miss Colombia transfers beautifully to this visually stunning Tiny Desk (home) concert. (Extra points if you can spot the tiny Tiny Desk!)

Backed up by a bevy of international musicians based in her new home of Toronto (I see you, members of the Cuban group Okan), you can hear for yourself how Pimiento's quartet of songs challenge the concept of just what qualifies as ""Latin music"" in a way that both honors and expands tradition.

There is added poignancy to the video; the visual theme is a quinceañera, a coming of age tradition that Pimienta could not share with her mother who had to flee Colombia. With her mom present at the video shoot, Pimienta uses her energetic performances to close a dramatic circle with her mom as we celebrate with her.

MkKYLILiSDo,The Flaming Lips: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bob Boilen | October 9, 2020
Wayne Coyne has appeared inside a bubble for over a decade. At concerts, he'd roll over the tops of adoring fans, their outstretched hands keeping him aloft. That was novelty long ago; now it seems prescient. For this Tiny Desk (home) concert, Wayne and his bandmates are seemingly quarantined from one another, with the bubble-sharing green-haired drummers and keyboards pairing off, playing together yet apart.

I don't think it's a stretch to say that going to a Flaming Lips concert stoned is a thing. The Flaming Lips have always embraced the surreal. Drugs are undoubtedly part of the culture, and on their new songs from American Head, drugs are at the core. These are songs for the lost, the overdosed dreamers, the damaged, the car crashed. On the album's opening track ""Will You Return/When You Come Down"" (which also begins this concert), Steven Drozd asks in falsetto, ""Will you return? Will you come down?"" while Wayne Coyne responds, ""Thinking back to those lost souls / And their ghosts / Floating around your bed / Hear it said / Now all your friends are dead.""

This visually enchanting Tiny Desk comes down to earth, with technical glitches that are fun to witness and keep it real.We hear old tunes sparking old memories, including ""Be Free, A Way"" from 2013's The Terror and ""It's Summertime"" from 2002's Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots. It's a thoughtful treat from a band that keeps on giving.

Angel Olsen is sitting on the porch of her new Asheville, N.C., home singing ""Whole New Mess."" She wrote it long before she bought this house. The song is actually about addictions, defining her ""home"" amidst a life of touring that kept her on the road for large chunks of time. Much like this Tiny Desk performance, the original recording is just her stunning voice and guitar (minus the birds and the trees), recorded in a church-turned-studio a few years ago.

Angel Olsen also plays ""Iota,"" a song that wishes ""that all the world could see something for what it is at the same time."" I've always thought of this as a hopeful song, and hearing it a half-dozen years after its release, the hope feels beyond her reach; nevertheless, for the handful of minutes she's singing, I feel comforted. Angel leaves us with ""Waving, Smiling,"" a farewell song. She says goodbye to the sounds around her, the birds, the chainsaws, and leaves us with a theme of acceptance, bittersweet but without regret.

3Cu67zSVl-U,Little Big Town: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future.

It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Ann Powers | October 6, 2020
The first time I heard Little Big Town, I knew they needed to play the Tiny Desk. This was eight years ago, when the country foursome made a splash with the playful hit ""Pontoon."" The easy fun these friends projected won me over, but I stayed for the crazy powerful harmonies. I soon discovered that Little Big Town had been perfecting its vocal blend for more than a decade – and the group just got better, and more adventurous, as its star rose. In 2014 came the spine-tingling ballad ""Girl Crush,"" in 2017 the Taylor Swift collaboration ""Better Man."" Both songs won Grammys. This year Little Big Town topped itself with its ninth album, Nightfall, a perfect balance of meditative moments and bangers that extends its reign as country's greatest contemporary quartet.

Little Big Town was making plans to appear at the Desk before the pandemic descended; instead, the members woodshedded separately, with married couple Jimi Westbrook and Karen Fairchild taking some beach time and Kimberly Schlapman and Phillip Sweet focusing on their own families. Returning to Nashville as the school year began, they gathered their expert band together (including a surprise guest trumpeter) for a career-spanning session in Fairchild and Wesbrook's living room. Early on, Fairchild notes that this is the longest the singers have spent apart in 25 years. You wouldn't know it. From the lush balladry of ""Nightfall"" to the party fun of ""Wine, Beer, Whiskey"" – and onward through absolutely chills-inducing versions of two of their biggest hits – Little Big Town shows how four voices can become one, and so much more than the sum of the parts.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Presenting the 2020 winner of NPR's Tiny Desk Contest, Supported by State Farm

Oct. 5, 2020 || Linda Diaz -- Winning the Tiny Desk Contest has been a surreal experience for me, not only because it's a big, big honor, but because it's all happening in the midst of a global pandemic. Even just shooting my Tiny Desk (home) concert has been a wild ride: getting the band together, getting the NPR team together, figuring out how to shoot safely with everyone in New York City. At one point, we finally had everything set and ready to go. Then, days before the shoot, I tested positive for COVID-19. I will spare you all the details (lots of tears, lots of phone calls), but I am so grateful for my band, the NPR Music team and the Javits Center for going above and beyond for me, the human as much as me, the musician.

Even though I couldn't be at the Desk, I'm feeling lucky to have been able to share some extra little parts of my personality with my (home) concert. Like, how dope is it to be able to say that I'm not only the 2020 Tiny Desk Contest winner, but that we were the first musicians ever to perform on the top of the Javits Center?! In more ways than one, this concert is a victory and a dream come true for me.

Through this whole process, it has felt weird to be celebrating, but what has been reiterated time and again is that it is more than OK to be Black and celebrate and mourn and organize and rest and any other number of things. Black joy is radical because it actively opposes defeat. It is necessary.

It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Oct. 1, 2020 | Bobby Carter -- In this Tiny Desk (home) concert, R&B star Jhené Aiko coasts through an eight-song medley that plays like the ultimate nod to her legions of fans — fans who've been begging for a Tiny Desk for a long time.

The Los Angeles native's star status is a result of her music's versatility and vulnerability. Jhené Aiko Efuru Chilombo has carved out a space of her own over the past decade, despite a rapidly changing R&B landscape. As a songwriter, she leaves no stone unturned, explicitly expressing her struggle, joy and sexuality while always administering the vibe.

Her latest album, Chilombo, released just before the pandemic hit the U.S., doubled down and leaned into the therapeutic nature of her songs — and that same aesthetic fuels her Tiny Desk. Backed by an ensemble of masked players, Aiko bookends her set with a sound bath of singing bowls that's peace personified through sound.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Sept. 30, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- Jason Isbell and Amanda Shires feel fortunate. They have their 4-year-old daughter, Mercy, a wonderful home, and each other. But as Jason points out, ""It's been a little difficult, we haven't gotten to do the thing we feel we were born to do."" Playing for an audience is what these two have been doing for a good part of their lives. Still, they're in their barn, making music for all of us to hear, and they are grateful for that. The songs for this Tiny Desk (home) concert are from Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit's Spring release, Reunions. ""Dreamsicle"" shares the story of a child seeing his family falling apart all around. Reflecting on those times, he finds fond memories, and the chorus of the song — ""a Dreamsicle on a summer night in a folding lawn chair"" — conjures up bright light even amidst the darkness.

The final song, ""It Gets Easier,"" deals with Jason's drinking demons, with a refrain filled with such stark truth: ""It gets easier, but it never gets easy."" These words could be an anthem for all those in recovery. It's the nature of Jason Isbell to sing the truth. He does it here with his remarkably talented partner and — unbeknownst to Mercy — a daughter that gives them strength.

It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bob Boilen | Sept. 29, 2020
This is the tiniest of Tiny Desk (home) concerts, a single song, recorded in Rwanda by The Good Ones. In 2019, the band's album RWANDA, you should be loved was one of my top 10 albums. They were to play a Tiny Desk concert in May of this year, but the world had other plans.

Adrien Kazigira and Janvier Havugimana know endless hardships. The night before this recording was made, a flood in Rwanda killed more than a dozen people and destroyed homes. Muddied water was more than waist high in Janvier's one-room hut. That next morning, Grammy-winning producer Ian Brennan and photographer Marilena Umuhoza Delli showed up to record the duo; she had the camera and he handled the audio. And though Janvier had been up all night dealing with the mud, they all took a two-hour drive to Adrien's hilltop farm. Janvier tapped out the rhythm with a key on a thermos; the jug was filled with milk — milk from a cow Adrien was able to purchase courtesy of a 2019 U.S. tour.

The performance is a song they'd just learned to play together: ""Soccer (Summer 1988)."" It's a nostalgic tune of a favorite soccer team, Rayon Sports F.C., from the days before the genocide in Rwanda took too many lives nearly a quarter of a century ago. Support means a great deal to these people, and if you like what you hear, their Bandcamp page is a good way to help The Good Ones.

It's been about a month since the release of the new Bright Eyes album. It's right about now that I likely would have seen Bright Eyes at the 9:30 Club here in D.C. Knowing that wasn't going to happen due to the pandemic, I'm thrilled to have Conor Oberst, Mike Mogis and Nate Walcott join ""together"" for a taste of live Bright Eyes. They recorded this Tiny Desk (home) concert with Conor and Mike at ARC Studios in Omaha, Neb., while Nate sits 1,500 miles away at Lucy's Meat Market, a well-equipped studio in Los Angeles filled with sweet-sounding vintage keyboards. Singing and seated behind him is Becky Stark, better known as Lavender Diamond, along with their daughter.

Despite the distance and the almost 10 years since their last record, the three songs they perform from Down in the Weeds, Where the World Once Was, are intense, with lyrics that are not always decipherable, filled with struggle and hope — in other words, the way I like them.

Conor has visited the Tiny Desk twice: first in 2014, when he brought his family and we invited kids for a memorable concert; and then in 2019 for a concert with Phoebe Bridgers as part of Better Oblivion Community Center. For this Tiny Desk (home) concert, he and the rest of Bright Eyes channeled that stripped-back rawness, and I think these songs shine for it.

Sept. 23, 2020 | Abby O'Neill - Conway the Machine is bringing the heat throughout our bizarre national quarantine with multiple albums and mixtapes, adding to the groundswell of Griselda buzz that's been building the past 12 months. As one third of the gritty rap group, Conway brings a distinctive swag and raw emotion to the Tiny Desk (home) concert series (as did his cousin, Benny The Butcher). Nestled into a booth at a diner in Queens, N.Y., Conway delivers five joints, including three from his 2020 album From King To A GOD. ""Front Lines,"" produced by Beat Butcha, was written after the killing of George Floyd and speaks directly to the racial profiling committed by cops while policing Black communities.

""The Cow"" is, as he says in the intro, ""one of [the] most personal and transparent records I ever wrote,"" in which he speaks about losing one of his best friends and getting shot in the head and neck. The injuries led to permanent facial paralysis. This poignant song, which will be featured on Conway's Shady Records debut album, God Don't Make Mistakes, is heart-wrenching and exposes the heavy trauma he endured while ascending in the rap game. The song has brought Conway to tears in the past, and the memories clearly get to him again here. That tenacity in the face of adversity is something we can all aspire to, especially in 2020.

Sept. 22, 2020 | Suraya Mohamed – In 2015, Oddisee visited the Tiny Desk with a drummer and a keyboardist. For his Tiny Desk (home) concert, he assembled his full band, Good Company, for the first time since the global pandemic cancelled their tour last spring. They rehearsed the day before this capture at Assorted Studios in York, Penn., the midway point between the members' hometowns of Philadelphia, New York City and Washington D.C. They picked this facility because it felt more like a living room than a studio. And to make it feel as cozy as possible, they brought memorabilia from their own homes. Bass player Dennis Turner brought family photos, Ralph Real (on the Fender Rhodes) brought his son's toy drum set, and Oddisee brought tribal statues from Sudan.

The five captivating songs are from his new EP, Odd Cure, ""a record I didn't want to write but needed to,"" Oddisee said in July. He wrote it in eight weeks, between March and May, while in self-isolation. He had just returned from a performance in Thailand and wanted to protect his family. Oddisee says these songs were inspired by the deluge of news, social media, misinformation and conspiracy theories generated during the first weeks of the pandemic. Relevant and inspiring, his music and its message addresses the uncertainty and anxiety we all live with today.

gFYAXsa7pe8,BTS: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"For new music, the latest Tiny Desk (home) concerts and more, sign up for the NPR Music newsletter, sent weekly: npr.org/nprmusicnewsletter

Stephen Thompson | Sept. 21, 2020
We've been trying to make a BTS Tiny Desk concert happen for years now — even gaming out ways we might move Bob Boilen's desk far enough forward to accommodate the superstar Korean boy band's dance moves.

In the end, it took a global pandemic — and the launch of Tiny Desk (home) concerts back in March — to make something happen. With BTS cooped up in Seoul, the group held true to the series's spirit by convening a live band for its Tiny Desk debut, and even arranged to perform in a workspace with a music-friendly backdrop: the record store VINYL & PLASTIC by Hyundai Card in BTS's hometown.

Opening with this summer's inescapable ""Dynamite"" — the group's first single to hit No. 1 in the U.S., as well as its first song to be fully recorded in English — BTS leaned hard into the new track's celebratory, ""Uptown Funk""-adjacent vibes. From there, the group dipped into its back catalog, seizing on the opportunity to showcase its quieter side while (mostly) staying uncharacteristically seated. The breezily propulsive ""Save ME,"" from 2016, ultimately gave way to a full-on power ballad in 2017's reflective ""Spring Day.""

The latter track seemed especially true to BTS's hopeful nature: Introduced with a few optimistic words from rapper and singer RM (""It's been the roughest summer ever, but we know that spring will come""), the song reflects on a need to wait out hard times, even as the weight of present-day pain feels oppressive.

BTS had intended to spend 2020 delighting the BTS Army in arenas around the world, only to spend these last few months performing in isolation. Released on the last day of a grim season, ""Spring Day"" provides a nice reminder of what awaits us on the other side. We just have to get through fall and winter first.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

September 16, 2020 | Suraya Mohamed -- Look to the left of Nubya Garcia's Tiny Desk (home) concert and you'll see a hanging plant swaying right above the keys. It never stops moving during the next 23 minutes, and it's for a bizarre reason. Garcia's (home) concert took place on a boat — a first in Tiny Desk history — because she was in between homes. Before the pandemic hit, the London-born jazz saxophonist and composer was booked for an extensive global tour that started in February 2020, and it was expected to continue through the end of the year. Because she was only going to be in London for a very short time, she gave up her flat, planning to stay with family and friends for short breaks. It seemed like a good idea until March, when COVID-19 shut down most of the world and the tour, too.

Garcia and her band are at Soup Studio, a recording facility built on a decommissioned floating lighthouse moored on the River Thames. It's also where Garcia recorded her excellent new album, SOURCE. This set features three songs from the record; the title track starts it off with a reggae, dub vibe. Garcia skillfully uses the entire range of her tenor saxophone, hitting convincing low and high notes with ease and resolve. Throughout the set, her tone is gorgeous, her musical intuition perfect. She projects rich and full melodic lines with refined solos that leave just enough space to take in the expressive sincerity of the music. There are no lyrics but her music conveys a message of staying grounded, being present in the moment and appreciating the comforts and feelings of what it means to be home.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Sept. 15, 2020 | Bobby Carter -- Most of us have experienced some form of heartbreak over the past few months. For me, music has proven to be the ultimate coping mechanism. Arlo Parks's songwriting taps into the feels we've all had this summer. Born Anaïs Oluwatoyin Estelle Marinho in London, she began writing poetry and songs because (according to her short bio) she spent her high school days ""feeling like that Black kid in school who couldn't dance for shit, listening to too much emo music and crushing on the girl in Spanish class."" Her ability to voice harsh bouts of despair, yearning and loneliness is juxtaposed by a gentle delivery that leans into folk and R&B. That same sort of contradiction is apparent in her decor: An MF Doom poster for 1999's Operation Doomsday hangs in a room with pretty accent lights lights, plants and a corduroy sofa. The subjects she writes about are familiar to us, but our expressions of grief rarely land so beautifully.

Accompanied by a guitar from her home in London, Parks opens with her latest single, ""Hurt"", followed by the three songs that introduced her to the world and remind us that we really aren't alone.

Declan McKenna and his band rock their Tiny Desk (home) concert. Their ""home,"" in this case, is The Foundry, a neighboring studio in North London. Declan is decked out with glitter, channeling a more flamboyant side of rock than I've seen from him before. He's still immersed in complex storytelling with characters on the fringes, alienated for reasons of class and politics.

Three of the songs are from Zeros, his brand new album recorded in Nashville with producer Jay Joyce. It's been a wild three-year ride since the release of his teenage smash debut What Do You Think About the Car? He's now 21 and leads a fiery, honed band that developed serious chops after a few years of touring; Isabel Torres (guitar), Nathan Cox (keyboards), William Bishop (bass), and Gabrielle Marie King (drums) all propel the songs of Declan McKenna.

For his Tiny Desk (home) concert finale, Declan performs his best-known song, ""Brazil,"" a tune steeped in politics and sports, and the enthusiasm has him atop a tiny desk in the end.

It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

For her Tiny Desk (home) concert, Phoebe Bridgers chose the White House. OK, maybe it's a green screen, but she and her team created a sweet mock-up of the Oval Office, with Phoebe performing behind a very special desk. It's a far cry from the hotel bed in Austin we first filmed Phoebe on back in 2017, but her ambitions and talent run high. She played the Tiny Desk later that year and returned with newfound bandmates, Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker, as boygenius one year later. But there was more to come when she surprised us all for a magical collaboration with her musical hero Conor Oberst as Better Oblivion Community Center just six months later.

Phoebe and bandmates Marshall Vore on drums and Harrison Whitford on guitar perform three songs from her brilliant new album, Punisher. They open with ""Kyoto,"" a story song based on her first trip to Japan, followed with a sweet version of ""Moon Song"" and the sad details of loving someone who doesn't love themself. And then comes the kicker, as Phoebe introduces herself with the words ""I hope everybody's enjoying their apocalypse,"" as the band kicks into her surreal doomsday tune ""I Know the End."" And what an end it is: The trio expands to an ensemble and a crowd-sourced chorus of fans — recording from bedrooms, cars, backyards and trampolines — lets out the kind of cathartic scream that has come to define 2020 for so many of us.

For his Tiny Desk (home) concert, Bill Callahan stands outside his home, near a desk adorned with a taller-than-usual globe, two books and a single banana. Joined by trumpet player Derek Phelps and guitarist Matt Kinsey, the trio performs ""Released"" from 2019's Shepherd in a Sheepskin Vest and three songs from Gold Record, which came out just last week. Callahan has a deep pocket of stories to tell, whether his own or those of other characters. Either way, we are all ears.

I keep coming back to a lyric from ""Another Song,"" which he performs here: ""Lonesome in a pleasant way."" We're all a little bit more lonesome than usual right now, but we're lonesome together. Maybe that feels OK, pleasant even.

Callahan, in the zone during this performance, shares so few words between songs that we decided to follow up and ask what he's been feeling about his world today.

""There are a lot of voices these days. So many that, I think, even positive sentiments become detrimental in their deafening number,"" Callahan explains. ""Quiet reflection can be the clearest and most informative and soothing voice you'll ever hear. There are many unknowns at this time in history. It's more than a junction in our old world. It's the possibility of a whole new world. A large part of me believes this. Listen to music, read books, talk to friends and family. Don't listen to the voices, not even mine!""

Protoje is a not-so-secret treasure who's been a vital force in the reggae revival movement these last several years. Perched in the hills of Irish Town on the fringe of Kingston, Protoje welcomes us into his backyard (which doubles as The Habitat Studio) for a uniquely fresh spin on a Tiny Desk (home) Concert. With a custom-designed set flanked by lush greens and mountains in the distance, this creative backdrop complements the uplifting feeling of Protoje's music. He speaks to his spiritual philosophy and faith on ""Deliverance"" with a chorus stating, ""I hold my order, give my praises / Oh Jah, deliver me through these days, Jah deliver me / Sometimes really hard to go and face it / Oh this life can truly be amazing, amazing."" The accompanying songs in this performance, ""Strange Happenings"" and ""Same So"", are also featured on his latest and fifth album, In Search of Lost Time. He wraps his performance with his most recognizable chart-topping hit, ""Who Knows,"" which featured Chronixx on the original recording. All in all, the vibes are plentiful and highly in-demand right about now.

It was the album Daniel co-wrote with Kacey Musgraves, Golden Hour, that bonded Burt and Daniel. They met the day after Daniel received a Grammy for that record.

Daniel's strength is in his lyrics, and you can listen to how Burt Bacharach and Daniel Tashian meld their talents of melody and lyricism in this Tiny Desk (home) concert. The songs come from their recent EP, Blue Umbrella, which they recorded together in Nashville before the pandemic. But for this Tiny Desk, the two were thousands of miles apart. And though there's distance between them, their recent friendship feels like a deep bond. A love of songcraft brought these tremendous talents together, writing songs of friendship, songs that have been a comfort for both of them in these challenging days.

vhfsae_nv-4,Anat Cohen and Marcello Gonçalves: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Colin Marshall | September 2, 2020
Anat Cohen and Marcello Gonçalves's music comes from the heart of Brazil. The first two songs are choros, from the choro genre of music that originated in 19th century Rio de Janeiro. Think of choro music like New Orleans jazz, but in South America, both born of European and African influences. Cohen, on the other hand, is a clarinetist from Israel and the composer of these tunes. She developed a passion for Brazilian music while studying at Berklee College of Music and not long afterward found herself in a ""roda"" (choro jam session) in Rio de Janeiro with some of the most virtuosic players in Brazil's choro scene. It was on that trip 20 years ago when Cohen met Gonçalves for the first time. All these years later, choro music has woven many of the threads in Cohen's musical fabric.

This duo was recently revered for their 2018 Grammy-nominated record, Outra Coisa, which celebrates the music of the iconic Brazilian woodwind player and composer Moacir Santos. Gonçalves is acclaimed for refining Santos's orchestral arrangements down to just two musicians. Notice Gonçalves's seven-string guitar, a common instrument in choro music; the additional string extends the lower register as if to combine an acoustic and bass guitar. Cohen explained in an email that playing with Gonçalves ""makes me feel like I am playing with a full band.""

If not for the pandemic, Cohen would be on tour right now with two projects: the supergroup Artemis (which will release its self-titled debut album on Sept. 11 on Blue Note Records) and the Anat Cohen Tentet, which received a Grammy nomination of its own for the 2019 release Triple Helix. But this duo has managed to stay productive in Rio, with a new album in the works. Gonçalves is thankful for his time with Cohen this year to ""practice our instruments, play in duo, compose, record or simply have silence, peace and stay safe.""

-yiQbeB7Bk8,"Yo-Yo Ma, Stuart Duncan, Edgar Meyer and Chris Thile: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert","The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Sept. 1, 2020 | Josh Rogosin -- Yo-Yo Ma, arguably the best known cellist in the world, assembled the world-class musical ensemble known as Goat Rodeo nearly 10 years ago. You've probably heard Stuart Duncan playing fiddle on albums with Dolly Parton, Robert Plant and Alison Krauss, and he was named the Academy of Country Music Fiddle Player of the Year numerous times. Edgar Meyer has played bass with Joshua Bell, Béla Fleck and Christian McBride, and the Nashville Symphony commissioned his first orchestral work in 2017. And you'd most likely recognize Chris Thile's vocals and mandolin in the music of Nickel Creek and Punch Brothers.

The four musicians played Bob Boilen's desk as Goat Rodeo in 2011. Fast forward a decade and this collaboration channels that same spectacular frenzy, separately captured in the gorgeous homes of the artists and mixed to perfection. As the audio engineer for Tiny Desk, I don't have a favorite (home) concert yet, but the very first few seconds of this performance sent chills up my spine.

Not Our First Goat Rodeo (which you can hear at this link: https://goatrodeo.lnk.to/NotOurFirstTD) is the second album in nine years from the ultimate jam band, and it's just as spontaneous and joyful to listen to as their first, The Goat Rodeo Sessions. All four musicians are credited as composers. They're accompanied by songwriter Aoife O'Donovan, who lends her pitch-perfect vocals to close out the set. Chris Thile, the master of ceremonies for this Tiny Desk (home) concert, explains that ""The Trappings"" is about work/life balance, a timely sentiment.

It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Abby O'Neill | August 31, 2020

For her Tiny Desk (Home) Concert, Tiwa Savage returned, from London, to her birthplace of Lagos, Nigeria. She and The Alternative Sound band set up at the beautiful Jazzhole, a historic vinyl shop well-regarded among record collectors for the rarities within.

""As much as I would have loved to have performed at Bob's desk,"" she wrote to us in email afterwards, ""I am really honored to have captured my session in my home city of Lagos, Nigeria. The Jazzhole is a happy place for me and always feels like home."" With floor-to-ceiling shelves packed with books and albums as a backdrop, it certainly seems familiar to us, too — reminiscent of our performance cubicle at NPR HQ.

Tiwa, a veteran R&B and Afrobeat singer who began her career at age 11, has an enthralling elegance — both with the soft tonality of her voice and her striking natural beauty. On ""Dangerous Love"" she speaks to matters of the heart, takes a detour to the Reekado Banks single ""Like"" that she featured on, before wrapping the set with her newest single, ""Koroba,"" which blends her native Yoruba language with Nigerian Pidgin English, underpinned by a catchy, feel-good rhythm.

4sZ2_aGsLKU,Billie Eilish: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Aug. 26, 2020 | Stephen Thompson -- It didn't take long for Billie Eilish to become one of the biggest pop stars in the world, sweep the Grammy Awards' major categories and release the latest James Bond theme. And today, at just 18, she and her brother, Finneas, have accomplished what no one has been able to do for five and a half months: perform a Tiny Desk concert in what certainly appears to be the NPR Music offices.

Of course, due to safety concerns, even the NPR Music staff can't set foot in the building that houses Bob Boilen's desk. But if you look over Eilish's shoulder, there's no mistaking the signs that she's appearing at the Tiny Desk in its present-day form: On the last day before staff began working from home, I took home the Green Bay Packers helmet that sat on the top shelf — the one Harry Styles had signed a few weeks earlier — for safe keeping. In this performance, that spot is empty.

So how the heck did they do it?

Honestly, it's best that you watch the whole video to experience the extent of the technical feat — which, in the spirit of Eilish's Saturday Night Live performance, they're willing to share with you. And thankfully, we still have our ways of photographing the desk, even if the room has fallen silent.

So settle in for a welcome jolt of Tiny Desk innovation, not to mention two of the excellent standalone singles Billie Eilish has released in the past year: ""my future"" and ""everything i wanted."" And, seriously, be sure to watch until the very end.

Aug. 25, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- Yola is an electrifying performer. My first experience — in the dark, dingy basement of Grimey's at the 2016 AMERICANAFEST in Nashville — was stunning, soulful and frenetic. To see this British singer now — sitting in a grassy, sunlit backyard in Nashville with acoustic guitar accompaniment — was worthy of a double-take. But that's what makes these Tiny Desk (home) concerts so fascinating. We get reintroduced to the deeper sides of so many of the participating artists. In this case, Yola performs songs with guitarist Jordan Tice of Hawktail. They're beautiful interpretations of songs from her 2019 album Walk Through Fire and her 2016 EP Orphan Offering that pull back the intensity I associate with Yola's music, but are still passionate and fervent. This is a rare Yola moment in her temporary quarantine home, so put the whiskey aside, grab a glass of iced tea and chill.

Bobby Carter | August 24, 2020
With beats, effects and synths pumping through a DJ mixer sitting on a school desk in his home studio in Australia, we present Tame Impala like you've never heard it before. As much as I love Tame Impala's music, I'm probably more intrigued by the creative process that brings the songs to life. The studio version of the band is pretty simple on paper: All songs are written, produced and performed by Kevin Parker. For the live version, Parker is still front and center but surrounded by a host of musicians who interpret his recorded work almost to a tee.

So it came as a shock to me when the Australian maestro explained what he wanted to do for his Tiny Desk (home) concert or his ""Tame Impala Soundsystem"" as he puts it. ""I'll get Jay (Watson) and Dom (Simper) and we'll do this kind of electronic jam with heaps of equipment around us and we'll recreate the songs with samplers and sequencers,"" Parker says. ""I've wanted to do something like this for a while and thought Tiny Desk would be the opportunity to do it.""

Bob Boilen | August 20, 2020
In a sunlit room in Nashville, Courtney Marie Andrews sings about the fear of love. ""I've grown cautious, I've grown up / I'm a skeptic of love / Don't wanna lose what I might find."" Yet, ""Burlap String"" is also a song about how love's memory lingers, and how the mind rekindles its beauty. Complex emotions are a hallmark of Courtney Marie Andrews's music over these past 10 years, and she's still just 29. In an intimate setting such as this, her voice is also her strength. You can hear it in her 2019 Tiny Desk Concert and hear the way her pleasing vibrato intertwines with Mat Davidson's (a.k.a. Twain) pedal steel guitar. Bassist Paul Defiglia also recorded this performance, which starts with him as part of a trio, that turns to a duo, and finally ends with Courtney alone, singing the final song on her seventh album, Old Flowers, about that lost love, hoping for closure with fondness.

Rising reggae star Lila Iké has an all-encompassing vibe, and you can feel it in this Tiny Desk (home) concert. Lila and her crew of musicians outfitted a home in Jamaica for this video, and the layout resembles the Tiny Desk's home in Washington, D.C. I was thrilled to see that Lila performed her hit single ""I Spy"" for this quarantine concert; it's full of the flair I've been missing the last several months. Lila's vocal agility can bend notes and transcend genres, the kind of voice that makes you want to turn to your friend at a show and say ""Is she for real??"" On ""Solitude,"" she blends avant-garde R&B with contemporary reggae in a hauntingly elegant song complemented by violinist Sean ""Ziah"" Roberts. ""Thy Will"" (which borrows from the iconic reggae rhythm section Sly & Robbie) ends the set with an uptempo banger. I hope these vibes have a lasting effect and provide a tropical respite during the fall and winter months.

It is beyond appropriate to have the two members of Buscabulla sitting inside their car at the beach in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico performing their Tiny Desk (home) concert. It's as if the bubble of being inside the car will protect them from any chances of encountering the virus on the beach. But it's also a reflection of how the band's atmospheric sonic textures get inside your head when we listen with headphones. Buscabulla set up shop in New York years ago, but returned to their home to help support the island's redevelopment — thus their entry from the beach.

Lead vocalist Raquel Berrios's voice is sultry and tinted with reverb, while her creative partner in the band, bassist Luis del Valle, has created a studio within the car that perfectly reflects the band's sound.

August 17, 2020 | Bob Boilen - Norah Jones keeps the music tastefully spare on her seven records despite a number of collaborators, yet I've always wished to hear just her voice and her piano in a room. The unfortunate circumstances of our times have given us something beautiful. For this Tiny Desk (home) concert, Norah Jones sits in her music room; it's just Norah, her upright piano, her poetry, and that golden voice. I first fell in love with that voice when I heard her debut album in 2002 and remember playing it on All Songs Considered that next week.

Here Norah plays songs from her seventh record, Pick Me Up Off the Floor, songs that hold the world's weight and the power to uplift. You can hear that on ""I'm Alive,"" which she co-wrote with Jeff Tweedy. It's a song that at once feels the pain of politics and a pain that is personal. ""You feel your soul / Get hollowed-out / While the world implodes / You just live without."" Yet the refrain is what lingers, ""Oh, I'm alive / Yes, I'm alive / But I'm alive / Oh, I'm alive."" Thanks, Norah, for this beautiful affirmation.

Aug. 12, 2020 | Bobby Carter -- You've never really experienced the Flatbush Zombies if you haven't been to one of their live shows. The hip-hop group's knack for tearing down festival stages is well documented and the energy transfer between members Zombie Juice, Meechy Darko and Erick Arc Elliott and their crowds is ferocious to put it lightly. So when I heard that they were recording a Tiny Desk concert from home, I was curious as to if and how that energy would manifest in a confined space.

Backed by a powerful ensemble from a house in Los Angeles, the Zombies present themselves like we've never seen or heard. Stripped down versions of ""when i'm gone,"" fan favorite, ""Palm Trees"" and the brand new James Blake-produced ""Afterlife"" are almost completely different from the recorded versions. I'm hoping this is the start of something new for the group once the regular show resumes.

Aug. 12, 2020 | Tom Huizenga -- ""I hope everybody stays safe and is good to each other,"" Víkingur Ólafsson says at the end of this beautiful four-song set.

Before he packed his final bags to return to his native Iceland, the pianist gave one last performance from his home in Berlin. His career has moved from strength to strength, releasing three terrific albums in a row (Philip Glass, J.S. Bach, Debussy-Rameau). And now that he has a young son, he wants to spend as much time with the family as possible these days.

After grounding us in the resilient music of Bach, Ólafsson offers a crash course in the fascinating music of Jean-Philippe Rameau and Claude Debussy, two French composers who lived nearly 200 years apart. Ólafsson connects the dots between the two seemingly strange bedfellows, illustrating his points with demonstrations on his Steinway.

Ólafsson has penchant for making transcriptions, taking pieces written for other instruments and making them his own. He closes with ""The Arts and the Hours,"" his mesmerizing arrangement of a scene from Rameau's final opera, which he plays as a farewell to his Berlin apartment.

V7swrM4dfuo,Becca Mancari: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

""When I wrote this record it was about my own personal journey towards transforming from anger into forgiveness."" In her calm, wise way, Nashville-based, New York-born singer-songwriter Becca Mancari frames her Tiny Desk (home) concert with this comment at the set's end. Mancari's new album, The Greatest Part (produced by drummer Zac Farro, who also plays in Paramore), tells her story of coming out and discovering a life path. This 15-minute set, recorded in bass player Duncan Shea's woodsy home studio, is an illuminating abridged version.

It's a joy, in this time of isolation, to see her band connect and build something beautiful, despite the masks. ""The band and I have been in our own little Corona-pod, but we wanted to be extra safe,"" Mancari says of the protective gear. She postponed this concert when the Black Lives Matter protests began in May: ""I wanted to be so careful of respecting an extremely important movement in our country both now and then. So, we decided to all wait, learn, grow, protest, and listen.""

Extra time gave the band a chance to deepen its bond. Mancari's songs often seek to reveal the unspoken, and you can hear that process in the way Caleb Hickman's inventive keyboard parts respond to Mancari's voice and Juan Solorzano's searching guitar lines. ""We actually filmed on July 4 to the sounds of fireworks,"" Mancari said. The only fireworks needed were in the room.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

August 5, 2020 | Bobby Carter - I spend a considerable amount of time in the comments section for our concerts. I'm always curious to see what the listeners think about the shows we produce. Masego fans had plenty to say about his stint at the Tiny Desk, but there was an unusual amount of praise for his guitar player: ""She's nice on that guitar"" ... ""Everyone's talking about that girl on guitar. She's a beast"" ... ""Melanie Faye on guitar. What a treat. Maybe everyone didn't know her then, but they will.""

I didn't know, but I quickly got in line. Only then did I realize that in addition to being a guitar virtuoso, she's an equally talented singer-songwriter. Songs like ""It's A Moot Point"" and ""Super Sad Always"" take on a deeper meaning in quarantine times, so we invited her to rock solo from her home in Nashville. The introduction for this set is dedicated to an obvious hero of hers, Jimi Hendrix, whose picture is draped above her shoulder on the wall. From there, she rolls into acoustic versions of the aforementioned tracks, along with ""Eternally 12."" All three songs can be heard on her upcoming self-titled EP, out Aug. 13.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

August 4, 2020 | Bob Boilen - Like so many artists, Kate Davis was to be on tour during the spring and summer of 2020. She was scheduled to play a concert at my desk in May. Sitting by her desk at home, Kate Davis is marking time by writing new music and performs one of those new tunes, ""Ride or Die,"" for this quarantine concert. She's an extraordinary lyricist. Her 2019 album, Trophy, was a sharply worded collection of songs, many about growing up and a powerful tune about her father's death. ""Open Heart,"" the second song performed for her Tiny Desk (home) concert, is about a broken heart. It's a subject tackled by many, but her lyrical prowess sets the scene in the hospital, where the doctor cuts her open, sees her critical condition, and takes out her broken heart. She sings, ""Put the pieces back together, looks like it's been shattered by a bad love,"" later adding, ""You'd rather feel this pain than have a broken heart."" Hearing these songs stripped to their essence — just Kate Davis and her guitar — exposes her charm and wit.

I look forward to what she comes up with as time allows her to write more timeless tales.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

August 3, 2020 | Bob Boilen - John Legend fully embraced the spirit of the Tiny Desk for his quarantine concert. He filmed this four-song performance in an office, in this case the Los Angeles office of his management company Friends At Work. He endearingly refers to his piano as his ""tiny desk."" He flew his seven-piece band out from Philadelphia to fill that office with utter joy.

They kick off the set with ""Ooh Laa,"" a song John calls ""doo-wop meets trap"" it's also the lead-off track to his summer album, Bigger Love. In fact, all of the songs filmed on this day are from Bigger Love, including ""Conversations in the Dark,"" which John says is ""a good song for babies to dance to — you might want to get married to it, too, if you're so inclined."" Meanwhile, behind the band on a big screen reads, ""Speak the truth, even if your voice shakes.""

While introducing his final song, ""Bigger Love,""he tells us that ""I wrote all the songs before the pandemic, before we saw folks marching in the streets, mourning (the) life of George Floyd, expressing their outrage. But some of these songs feel even more appropriate now, feel like we need them more now then we did even when I wrote them. This song 'Bigger Love' is about the power of love to get us through tough times, the idea that when you have love, it makes you more resilient, it makes you more hopeful And we all need a little dance break, too, right?"" So enjoy and turn it up.",2020-07-29 13:55:58,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFxQbPYe_ZA,HOME,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tFxQbPYe_ZA/default.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tFxQbPYe_ZA/mqdefault.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tFxQbPYe_ZA/hqdefault.jpg,NPR Music,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A

It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

July 29, 2020 | Abby O'Neill -- Lyric Jones is a culturally authentic and classic Bostonian. It's evident through her music and the insightful words she shares between songs that she's got a signature northeastern demeanor and the ""true school"" flow and lyrical content to match. With that demeanor also comes an unceasing work ethic, and Lyric makes it abundantly clear that her hustle is nonstop – writing, rapping, singing, drumming, engineering, and grinding it out to make Gas Money (the title of her latest album). This quintuple threat, trained in the Berklee College of Music's City Music program, recorded this Tiny Desk (home) concert from her studio in Los Angeles in May. Her multi-layered prowess is present on ""Adulting"" a song about the evolutionary growth that happens in your late 20s and early 30s. Lyric uses a TC Helicon vocal processor to create percussive beats, looping her voice as a backdrop and packing a punch with vocal harmonies and ad libs. In grappling with the pandemic, Lyric expresses the deep importance of this moment: ""Whatever we put out in this time, in this era is a bookmark in history. Especially as musicians. ... For me, my personal testament, I want to be intentional. ... My children's children are gonna know about this time. And I want to know that I impacted it with intentional music, intentional thoughts, insights and perspectives."" She is doing just that.

Bob Boilen | July 28, 2020
For her Tiny Desk (home) concert, Thao Nguyen opens with a somber version of ""Temple,"" the dance-oriented title track from Thao & The Get Down Stay Down's new album. The song is an homage to her parents, who were refugees of the Vietnam War. Thao sings from the perspective of her mother, honoring their hard-fought freedom and their hopes that their daughter is blessed with the ability to pursue her own happiness. She recorded it as a trio with cellists (and neighbors) Elisabeth Reed and Andy Luchansky. It's a powerful rendition that celebrates, in Thao's words, ""being queer and being out in my career, something that being out publicly has caused a lot of turmoil and unrest in my own life."" Please give a listen to what she has to say in this remarkable video. We also hear ""Pure Cinema"" from Temple and a mandolin version of ""Departure"" from her 2016 album, A Man Alive.

July 27, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- To me, it's still thrilling to see a concert in an office — even if it's not the one, back at NPR, that I'm used to. Lucinda Williams and her guitar mate, Stuart Mathis, set up shop for this performance at Thirty Tigers' headquarters in Nashville, a place usually filled with artist managers and folks who distribute music, including hers.

Lucinda kicks off this Tiny Desk (home) concert with a nod to the present moment, a song called ""Bad News Blues"" from her 2020 release, Good Souls Better Angels:

Fools and thieves and clowns and hypocrites,
Gluttony and greed, and that ain't the worst of it.

When it closes, Lucinda says, ""we've had our share of bad news, even before this lockdown thing."" The COVID-19 crisis has kept her from seeing her other bandmates, who are out in California, but this minimalist pairing, of Lucinda's voice and Stuart's sliding blues, is quite the treat.

July 22, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- After performing her opening song, ""Heat Rises,"" Nilüfer Yanya pauses to say a few things about herself, something we've been asking artists to do for these Tiny Desk (home) concerts.

""One of the things that's been on my mind a lot is the racism and violence and injustice going on towards Black people and people of color, not only in America but here in the U.K. and all over the world. As a person of mixed heritage"" — Nilüfer's father is Turkish and her mother is of Irish and Barbadian descent — ""this issue is something close to my heart."" Nilüfer urges us all to see the hurt being done. It's the only way forward.

She then plays ""Paralyzed,"" a song she's not performed live before, from her brilliant 2019 record Miss Universe. I hear these words so differently now:

I hear strained screams from Heaven singin'
""save me""
This can't be okay
Shadow's lyin' here
And it's blocking out the light
(I am paralyzed)

She also unveils a new song for us, ""Day 7,"" and performs two others from Miss Universe, providing a lovely contrast to her full-band performance at my desk last year and an easy introduction to an artist who may, and most likely will, make her way to your heart.

Bob Boilen | July 21, 2020
One of my top albums in 2017 was Silence, from Tom Adams – that transfixing falsetto set against minimalist piano was a balm. I imagined his Tiny Desk (home) concert to be Tom and his piano; what we have is Tom Adams at his home in Cornwall, England, playing four brand-new songs with minimal electric guitar and an enthralling mix of tech-altered sounds. That box with all the wires in the foreground is a Eurorack modular synthesizer which, in real time, processes his majestic voice in ways unpredictable even to Tom. He wrote to tell me that, ""Once the system is set in motion, you never know exactly what will happen next... I like to think of it as being a bit like the waves on the beach; to some extent, they are all predictable, yet each wave is still unique."" It's a lovely way to describe this new music from this singular talent.

Adjoining him is his longtime collaborator, co-writer and guitarist Craig Ross, and young mentee Yianni Giannakopoulos, who collectively blend rich layers of rhythmic and canorous guitar. ""What Did I Do With My Life?"" seems like a response to the questions posed in the chorus of ""Thinking of You""; the refrain alludes to living up to what his mother wanted him to be. And it's only fitting that he ended with ""We Can Get It All Together,"" a message about the power of unity and oneness.

6Zf5dB6HFp4,Diana Gordon: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Considering how many of us have rearranged our lives to make the home-office lifestyle work, Diana Gordon's setting for her Tiny Desk (home) concert frames her music in a curated chaos that's all too relatable. Teetering towers of manilla folders, the Y2K kitsch of a slime green Apple iBook, clunky cardboard boxes and a Curb Your Enthusiasm coffee mug — it's just the right amount of cramped, mundane confusion to aid her creativity.

Like the workplace props that flank her, an intriguing dose of neurotic mess makes Gordon's latest EP, 2020's Wasted Youth, feel so fitting for these unprecedented times. With her masked-up guitarist, Davin Givhan, helping to guide her, Gordon's nihilistic invincibility on ""Rollin"" and sonic eyeroll-shrug on ""Wasted Youth"" offset the forlorn lilting yodel of ""Wolverine"" and her tear-jerking honesty on ""Once A Friend.""

After years of writing hits for others and releasing music under the moniker Wynter Gordon, the Queens, N.Y., native has awakened new aspects of her artistry in recent years that she's finally ready to share under her given name. But while her earlier work routed through the pop and dance worlds, Wasted Youth swerves between lanes of trap, R&B and alternative rock as Gordon swings her head out of the window. Balancing influences of Whitney Houston, Alanis Morissette and The Cranberries' Dolores O'Riordan in her runs, this singer-songwriter navigates each verse with poignant and reassuring solace. No matter where Gordon takes you, she's in the driver's seat.

Abby O'Neill | July 13, 2020
Producer/guitarist Tom Misch and drummer Yussef Dayes released a surprising and stunning collaborative album earlier this year called What Kinda Music, which I've listened to countless times these past couple months. This Tiny Desk (home) concert — recorded across six different musicians' homes — features two songs from that album, ""Nightrider"" and ""Tidal Wave."" On the former, special guest John Mayer provides a closing solo, just as he did at last year's Crossroads Guitar Festival. Also accompanying is longtime Misch collaborator Jordan Rakei and Tom Driessler on bass. ""Tidal Wave,"" featuring Rocco Palladino on bass and Joel Culpepper on backing vocals, is equally hypnotic. Like the album, this short set evokes a dreamy utopia, blending live electronica, psychedelia and avant-garde jazz. The poignant hook of ""Tidal Wave"" — ""Chaos / Throwing midnight like a tidal wave / Raindrops / Filling up your eyes as the water takes the stage"" — feels symbolic and resonant with the current state of the world.

mJR6XSSKi-g,Jacob Collier: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

July 9, 2020 | Colin Marshall -- Polymath musician Jacob Collier has been championing this style of one-man-band music videos since 2012, singing every note and playing every instrument. His cover of Stevie Wonder's ""Don't You Worry 'Bout a Thing""earned him a devout YouTube following at the age of 19, and he hasn't slowed down since. The London wunderkind owns four Grammy Awards already, including two at the age of 22 in 2017, and his evolution as a bandleader has been evident in his live performances ( like when he came to NPR for a Tiny Desk concert last year). Now 25, and with nearly a decade of experience producing every aspect of his own music from his home, Collier is uniquely positioned to crank out his best work from quarantine. In this video, each of the four parts was recorded in a single take. Pay close attention ; it's easy to get tripped up inside Jacob's head as he arranges this Rubik's Cube of a video production, which feels both like a magic trick and a no-strings-attached bedroom session.

Since the pandemic hit hard in March, Collier has been hustling in his Internet-famous room. He's played duets over Instagram Live with the likes of Chris Martin, JoJo and Daniel Caesar, recorded a song in his bathroom, and he's in the middle of releasing his ambitious four-volume record, Djesse. The last song in this video is the premiere of his new single ""He Won't Hold You,"" which will appear on Vol. 3, due out later this year.

KC0pfCv4A0Y,Roddy Ricch: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

July 8, 2020 | Bobby Carter - This was slated to be Roddy Ricch's summer. He was having the breakout moment that I've seen from so many other Compton emcees before him. The young man born Rodrick Moore Jr. snagged his first Grammy. He had multiple hit songs on the radio, including the biggest song in the world in ""The Box,"" which spent 11 weeks at the top of Billboard's Hot 100 and will probably go down as the last pre-COVID club anthem. His live show refuted any doubts of his true musicianship and he was primed to touch every festival stage this season. No one could have anticipated in December how prophetic his debut album title — Please Excuse Me for Being Antisocial — would be.

Roddy was originally booked to play the Tiny Desk in June, but once the cancellation of festival season was fully realized, he and his team began mapping out something special for our home series. He flexes his range from the beginning, playing a keyboard atop a desk at famed auto garage West Coast Customs in California. Backed by the juggernaut musical collective 1500 or Nothin', this set exhibits the many dimensions of Please Excuse Me..., from ""Bacc Seat"" (featuring an appearance from Ty Dolla $ign) to the stunning rework of ""War Baby."" Many factors have contributed to the dissolution of a 'normal' summer in 2020, but Roddy Ricch is determined to prove that it's still his time to shine.

hARU2pnprX4,Chicano Batman: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Felix Contreras | July 7, 2020
It's very appropriate that Chicano Batman's Tiny Desk Home Concert comes with the band members in four separate boxes.

The group has been an Alt.Latino favorite, almost from the beginning, and I've always enjoyed listening to how creatively they've crafted their musical identity with layers of sound, from vintage organs to the most nuanced of funk grooves. So, watching them in their individual Hollywood-Squares-type boxes is the visual equivalent to how I listen to them.

The songs performed are from their new album, Invisible People which, coincidentally, is a major shift in their group sound. As you hear in songs like ""Polymetronomic Harmony,"" their sound is now much denser, with full-on references to a variety of influences, including the 1973, Herbie Hancock funk-jazz classic Head Hunters, which makes a walk-on appearance in the stack of vinyl just behind guitarist Carlos Arévalo.

Vocalist and keyboardist, Bardo Martinez, bassist, Eduardo Arenas, and drummer, Gabriel Villa all close their eyes during the performances, and you can both see and hear how they mentally inhabit the same musical place that has made them a favorite and clubs and festivals for nearly ten years, now.

Even as they each perform in their home music spaces, they can't avoid bringing it all together to give us a Chicano Batman performance that grooves hard and brings a smile to our faces.

It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

July 6, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- We've loved Dirty Projectors for more than a dozen years - from the band's Black Flag covers record to the brilliant angular sounds we presented at SXSW, and more recently, a candlelit Tiny Desk concert in 2018. The lineup often shifts, but the creative nature of this band, headed by David Longstreth, doesn't. The band is releasing 5 EPs this year. The lineup for this includes Maia Friedman on vocals, keyboard and guitar, Felicia Douglass on vocals and tabletop percussion, Kristin Slipp on vocals and keytar, and drummer Mike Johnson shaking and tapping all things tiny. It's a band in which any member can take the lead, and that's the beauty here. We see Dirty Projectors change and surprise us with each new song, something so rare and vibrant.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

July 3, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- This week we're taking the Tiny Desk (home) concerts international. In a basement in Gdańsk, we find Poland's great rock band Trupa Trupa on lockdown. Had it not been for COVID-19, this band would have been behind my desk this week, but as it is, they've settled into their rehearsal space. Singer Grzegorz Kwiatkowski has dusted off an acoustic guitar. At the same time, Rafał Wojczal plays his homemade instruments, including one that sounds a bit like an ondes Martenot or a theremin, but is as of this recording unnamed. Even with the sound level down, the energetic rhythms of Wojciech Juchniewicz on bass and Tomasz Pawluczuk on drums punch through.

Grzegorz tells us that life in Poland has been difficult in this young democracy, but they are staying optimistic and playing music. Trupa Trupa opens its set with ""Another Day,"" from the 2019 record Of The Sun. I've seen them perform this; it's always had an apocalyptic feel, but now the words ""another day, waiting for another,"" prompts Grzegorz to mention how this has turned into a quarantine song. There's darkness in the basement, yet their music is a bright beacon.

It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Abby O'Neill | July 2, 2020
The seraphic sounds by Brazil-born, L.A.-based guitarist Fabiano do Nascimento are hypnotic and transcendent, an amalgamation of Afro-Brazilian jazz, folklore, bossanova and samba. The combination of his overdubbed rhythmic and melodic guitar lines, coupled with the delicate hands of piano player David Bergaud and drummer Julien Cantelm, just seem to hit differently. It's a wandering journey that put me into what feels like the Samadhi state in meditation, where the brain frequency surrenders and the soul completely takes over. Fabiano and his band flow into the first number, ""Nanã,"" a folkloric composition that ""is the spirit that comes from African lineage and represents the forest ... and is the primordial mother of earth."" On ""Etude,"" a composition by Fabiano inspired by Cuban classical guitar virtuoso Leo Brouwer, he is joined by new accompaniment: Adam Ratner on guitar and Leo Costa on drums and chocalho. His love for his motherland Brazil — an ""endless foundation of inspiration"" — is threaded deeply into the tapestry of his sound and ethos. If you're looking for a musical moment of zen, this set comes highly recommended.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

July 1, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- This week we're taking the Tiny Desk (home) concerts to places rarely visited; yesterday was Seoul, South Korea. Today we take you to Malawi in Southeastern Africa to meet Nelson Mulligo of the Malawi Mouse Boys. We see his two-room home in the opening shot where he and his family live without plumbing or electricity. Then we see Nelson, standing below the power lines, holding his homemade guitar singing, ""I'm So Tired of You."" It's a song that sings out the evils of poverty, a life of hard physical work, of making money scavenging for mice amongst boars and snakes so they can sell them as roasted mice shish kabobs along the roadside. We only get one song, and even that cuts off abruptly, but I was deeply moved when producer Ian Brennan (Tinariwen, The Good Ones) sent it my way. He and his wife Marilena Umuhoza Delli met and recorded the Malawi Mouse Boys in 2011. You can hear Ian Brennan tell his story on NPR's Weekend Edition. If you fall in love with what you hear, give a listen to the entire band harmonize. You can find their music on Bandcamp here. Even though the group played Peter Gabriel's WOMAD festival in 2015, they still live in poverty. Support what you love.

Bob Boilen | June 30, 2020
This week we'll publish four Tiny Desk (home) concerts from around the world. We begin in South Korea, where Tiny Desk Concerts are quite popular. In fact, I invited the Korean band SsingSsing to perform in 2017 and that Tiny Desk concert has been viewed more than 5 million times.

Today, I bring you the music of Coreyah. According to the band, the name represents ""inheritance,"" and that's evident in the way this six-piece presents old or traditional Korean music with a modern twist. It's an uninhibited vision of Korean traditional music with some psychedelic rock, Balkan gypsy, even sounds from South America and Africa. You'll see and hear instruments including the daegeum, a large bamboo flute and geomungo, a large Korean zither that lays on the floor.

When translated into Hangul, the Korean alphabet, Coreyah means ""whale,"" which is the group's good luck charm. The music was recorded in the band's music studio in Seoul, with COVID-19 shutting down most of the country. Strict social distancing is still ongoing in South Korea, though they are streaming their concerts to fans. 

And just a note from the band: The geomungo player in this video is Park Dawool, as Coreyah member Na Sunjin was forced to miss this recording due to a personal emergency.

June 26, 2020 | Abby O'Neill -- The Jamaica-born, Miami-raised reggae artist BEAM is no stranger to the limelight. His father, Papa San, was a dancehall superstar during the late 1980s and early '90s before becoming a preacher. That combo meant BEAM developed musically and spiritually from an early age. Proudly reppin' a Broward County hoodie, the 23-year-old singer and his co-producer and keyboardist, Al Cres, brought a new flair to the Tiny Desk (home) concert series with some unorthodox visual effects. BEAM's light-hearted gravitas and charisma shine through from start to finish. ""MAD GAAL,"" featured on his 2019 major-label debut, 95, is sure to keep living room dancefloors bumping during the pandemic. He concluded the set with an exclusive: ""KUMBAYA"", a fitting song for this moment in history.

And that's pretty much what you get with this Tiny Desk (home) concert. We see M. Ward in the lounge of BOCCE, a recording studio in Vancouver, Wash. That tender wispy-rasp in his voice and flowing acoustic guitar make M. Ward a musician I'd want to hear up close. Matt Ward took song requests from fans for this concert, so we hear comforting and memorable older tunes like ""Poison Cup"" (2006) and ""Voice at the End of the Line"" (2003). Those songs fit so well with music on his new record, Migration Stories, from which he plays ""Coyote Mary's Traveling Show."" The imagery and stories allow my mind to imagine, conjure, and wander. So shut that door, turn down the lights, and listen.

Kara Frame | June 24, 2020 
With one quick glance, you can guess Madame Gandhi's favorite color. Surrounded by her yellow bongos and congas, a yellow desk from her youth and a yellow nightstand, her Tiny Desk (home) concert lighting nods to the lavender-lemon artwork of her 2019 Visions EP. She's intentional with everything she does, including activism that focuses primarily on gender liberation. She uses music to help elevate and celebrate female voices, from working with primarily queer women BIPOC on tour and video sets, to writing socially-conscious lyrics that challenge the white male-dominated music industry.. Madame Gandhi's clear, soft voice and swells of percussion give you the necessary space to meditate on her message of inclusion and equality.

Abby O'Neill | June 19, 2020 -- At the top of March when the COVID-19 pandemic became imminent, Griselda — the triple threat emcee collective from Buffalo, N.Y., consisting of Westside Gunn, Conway, and Benny the Butcher — were about a week away from joining us at NPR's office for the trio's scheduled Tiny Desk. That performance, of course, did not take place. Since then, NPR Music has been inviting artists to record Tiny Desk (home) concerts, and Benny the Butcher blessed us with a five-song set from the living room of his current home in Atlanta. (Due to some recording snafus, some of the audio and video in this video doesn't always sync up.)

The setlist includes ""Crown for Kings"" and ""5 to 50"" from his critically acclaimed 2019 album, The Plugs I Met. Benny is joined by Rick Hyde and Heem, two artists on his new BSF label imprint, for a live performance of ""Da Mob,"" the first single off an upcoming label compilation titled Benny The Butcher & DJ Drama Presents: Gangsta Grillz X BSF Da Respected Sopranos.

Bobby Carter | June 18, 2020 
I was very conflicted as I watched Little Dragon's Tiny Desk (home) concert. The group's latest album, New Me, Same Us, is their grooviest, most concentrated in years, and I was eager to hear these songs as Little Dragon's music is best experienced: live on stage. ""Some of you might know that we were supposed to be on tour in the states, but due to these crazy times it got canceled,"" lead singer Yukimi Nagano says. On that same token, these stripped-down iterations from the band's home studio in Sweden move me but in a different way. I find myself focusing on the songwriting and how all the instruments come together for these numbers, proving just how strong the tracks from New Me... are. Then as a bonus, Little Dragon played an oldie, ""Forever,"" which is still my favorite track from this genre-bending band. While I'm left to wish for the united movement with hundreds of others to the downbeat of songs like ""Rush,"" this Tiny Desk performance solidifies me as a die-hard fan. I'll be first in line when the show resumes.

Svv3IX8exP8,Haim: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

June 17, 2020 | Cyrena Touros -- Strung aloft the breezy sax melody of ""Summer Girl"" is the reminder that California is a state of mind. At least it was at one point. For Este, Danielle and Alana Haim, California is also a more permanent state of residence these days. All three sisters are back home in Los Angeles while self-quarantining, where each recorded their part for HAIM's Tiny Desk (home) concert in their separate Silver Lake residences.

But California is also a sound HAIM brings wherever it goes, even as the band explores new terrain on its cheekily titled upcoming album, Women in Music Pt. III. The sunny, take-no-prisoners assertion of independence of ""The Steps"" recalls the soft rock jams of 2013's Days Are Gone and 2017's Something to Tell You, but the muted techno glimmer of ""I Know Alone"" is new, as is the moodiness of ""Summer Girl,"" a song that wavers like a heat mirage reflected off New York's summer sidewalks, thanks to Henry Solomon's whisper-toned sax.

HAIM recorded its Tiny Desk set before the death of George Floyd, and released ""Summer Girl"" last year. The world has changed a lot in that time. With its opening line — ""LA on my mind, I can't breathe"" — ""Summer Girl"" becomes another piece of music that takes on a parallel meaning in the evolving social and political landscape of 2020.

Sidney Madden | June 11, 2020

""Baby, I almost shook my wig off! But that's what a love song does to you,"" KIRBY exclaims midway through her Tiny Desk (home) concert. And you know what? She's absolutely right. The music of this Mississippi singer-songwriter carries the most weight when it embraces those slightly disorienting, in-between stages of love's journey, the moments that playfully throw you for a loop.

KIRBY's panache here, bolstered by a yellow bodysuit and blonde afro, is infectious and — just like the sunny backdrop of her manager's LA home — her vocal runs radiate a soft power. Accompanied by Tiny Desk alumni guitarist Justus West and flanked by plenty of plant life, KIRBY leans heavy into love songs off her debut album, Sis. But don't let the throwback pop and doo-wop fool you — these tracks come with a dose of millennial spunk. ""New hair, new braids / Nina Simone with a touch of 'Yonce,"" she sings on ""Kool Aid"" with a confident smirk to camera.

Before ending her set, KIRBY welcomes yet another alum of the Tiny Desk, Grammy-nominated Lucky Daye, to join her on ""Velvet,"" a song that stands out on the current season of Insecure for highlighting the beautiful mess of Issa Dee's love life. It's no coincidence that Issa's mishaps fall in line with the starry-eyed tales KIRBY spins in her songs. In both cases, there's an authenticity in admitting not everything's figured out, but living it up anyway.

zdD3UsAemq0,Baby Rose: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Sidney Madden | June 10, 2020

Nestled in her cozy, clean bedroom of mostly white accents, Baby Rose stands out with an all-black outfit, her full, billowing waves and that voice. That voice! The depths of sorrow and passion the D.C. native digs into with such conviction has come to be reliably awe-inspiring. It's the reason her Tiny Desk concert earlier this year stopped us in our tracks. And it's the reason we've invited her back to bring the heat once again, albeit from a safe and secure distance.

Rose's message of ""staying safe"" during her Tiny Desk (home) concert has become a commonplace cordial greeting during the coronavirus pandemic. (It's partially the reason her pianist, Timothy Maxey, is giving her room even in these close confines.) But with the added context of so many protesting police brutality and racism by taking to the streets in the last few weeks, the words feel even heavier. Coming from Rose, it's not for the sake of nicety.

Earnest intention is the reason Baby Rose's music has found a place on HBO's hit series Insecure. In this bedroom mini-show, Rose performs ""Show You"" (which was used to underscore this season's most dramatic romantic plot twist), ""Pressure"" and — for the first time — ""Marmot,"" a new song premiered exclusively with NPR Music.

Baby Rose proves here she doesn't need bells and whistles to capture the intensity of a moment — just raw, real vulnerability.

k51uMl8rhp0,Sa-Roc: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

June 4, 2020 | Abby O'Neill -- If you want protest music for the uprising of the American consciousness, then look no further. Sa-Roc (born Assata Perkins) is an emcee from southeast Washington, D.C., and the second woman signed to Minneapolis-based hip-hop label Rhymesayers Entertainment, home to Atmosphere and Brother Ali among many others. In this Tiny Desk (home) concert, she debuted two exclusives, ""Deliverance"" and ""r(E)volution,"" both from her upcoming album, The Sharecropper's Daughter, which is produced by her partner in life, Sol Messiah, and scheduled for release this fall.

Sa-Roc bears her heart and soul here, weaving together influential threads from her upbringing; Pan-Africanism, the hardship of her father's experience as a sharecropper in Virginia and her own childhood in Congress Heights, D.C., an area ravaged by violence and the crack epidemic in the 1980s. On ""r(E)volution"" she spits bars: ""Embedded in the home of the brave, the darkest of interiors. / Saw street scholars and soldiers defect cuz they post-traumatic stressed from the American experience.""

""Music I was exposed to, as well as their ideology, was all politically minded and African centered,"" she expressed to me on the phone. ""The culture of DC go-go, Gil Scott Heron, and The Last Poets shaped me.""

Sa-Roc is a modern day griot whose aura radiates calm in a world of chaos. This Tiny Desk (home) concert is as close as it gets to required viewing.

lwSBAS2Pp-U,Lara Downes: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

May 30, 2020 | Tom Huizenga -- Lara Downes thrives on collaboration. Her new album features Toshi Reagon, the vocal ensemble MUSICALITY and the string quartet called PUBLIQuartet. But in this intimate piano recital from her home in Sacramento, Calif., her only collaborators are her son Simon, who takes on cinematography duties, and her beloved pooch, Kona.

The songs, all from her recent album Some of These Days, might be old, but they are strong statements that resonate in new ways. From Margaret Bonds, one of the first celebrated African-American women composers, there's ""Troubled Water,"" a poignant riff on the spiritual ""Wade in the Water"" that Downes says takes a ""journey from classical virtuosity to gospel, jazz, blues and back again."" Samuel Coleridge-Taylor's arrangement of ""Deep River,"" for Downes, now represents ""crossing over"" the coronavirus crisis, while Florence Price's ""Some of These Days,"" is a vision of better times ahead.

In a moment of vulnerability, Downes admits that not being out on the road – performing, embedded in communities and working with young people – makes her feel ""not very useful."" But in these performances there's a sturdiness and purpose that provide both comfort and the strength to carry on. Very useful, indeed.

It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

May 29, 2020 | Abby O'Neill -- This emotional Tiny Desk (home) concert by D Smoke is riveting. Last year, the rapper and pianist, born Daniel Farris, rose to national acclaim when he won Netflix's MC battle show Rhythm + Flow, judged by Chance the Rapper, Cardi B and T.I. Rhythm + Flow shifted the course of his life, allowing him to exit his teaching career and produce music full-time. D Smoke's songs here — taken from his latest album Black Habits, out earlier this year — acknowledge the disparities impacting the black experience that are simultaneously personal and universal. The opening selection, ""No Commas,"" is a heart-wrenching lament on injustice and inequality. The gentle touch of D's fingers moving across the keys complement the song's poignant lyrics, which he raps in English and Spanish. He also performed ""Black Habits II,"" the affecting finale to Black Habits, for the first time in a live setting. It's just one of the many reasons that this Tiny Desk is so special.

Though acknowledging their good fortune — a place to live, a bit of savings, their children being safe — Rhiannon Giddens also pauses to tell us how the pandemic has altered their entire way of life. They canceled their tour of Japan and returned home to Ireland; Rhiannon lives in Limerick while Francesco lives a few hours away in Dublin where they recorded this Tiny Desk (home) concert. They're finding comfort in being together, making music together, thinking of their families in both Italy and the United States, and hoping to comfort us all with some down-home tunes.

meebIY77RI8,Clem Snide with Scott Avett: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

May 23, 2020 | Stephen Thompson -- Recording a Tiny Desk concert at home naturally subtracts a lot of familiar elements: Bob Boilen's desk, for example; the wooden shelves full of weird ephemera; the crowd of work-shirking news-gatherers and the applause they provide. But when Clem Snide (the three-decade-old project of singer-songwriter Eef Barzelay) and special guest Scott Avett (the Avett Brothers co-founder who produced and performs on Clem Snide's latest album, Forever Just Beyond) performed together in Avett's barn, they added a few new features you've never gotten to hear at the Tiny Desk — most notably a noisy flock of birds and the unmistakable cries of a nearby rooster.

We've had a few disruptive animals at the Tiny Desk over the years, from the occasional dog to Bob Boilen himself, but this had to be our first rooster. As for Barzelay and Avett, they not only maintained social distancing throughout their set, but also rigorously enforced it with the aid of a visible tape measure. Still, their voices blended warmly as they tackled three spiritually searching songs from the (great) new record, as well as an older track that fits Forever Just Beyond's themes perfectly: ""Jews for Jesus Blues,"" from Clem Snide's 2005 album End of Love.

So in the vein of Method Man and Redman, Cheech and Chong, and other mischievous pairings, they bring us the after afterparty. For their Tiny Desk home session, or Jank session as they put it, they mirror the cover of their new project, Janktape Vol. 1: seated on a couch, red cups and bottles scattered, with the 1990s cult classic cartoon Bebe's Kids projecting on the wall behind them.

The Durham, N.C., couple gives us three songs from their home couch using modular synths, a rhythm machine and Amelia's heartfelt vocals.

It kicks off with two tracks from The Mirror, an album released just as we entered our quarantine period in mid-March: ""I Love The Afternoon"" and ""I Really Want To See You Again,"" a song that poetically captures the joy of friendship.

May 15, 2020 | Bobby Carter -- As the angelic riffs start and the camera fades up, I was immediately captivated by the artwork that adorns the walls for this Tiny Desk from home. The artist is 3-year-old Isley-Rose; the singer is her mother, Alex Isley. The name they both share is courtesy of R&B royalty Ernie Isley, currently one half of the incomparable Isley Brothers and Alex's father. For nearly a decade now, Alex Isley has slowly but surely made a name for herself, hitting the radar of NPR's Heat Check playlist and recently landing a spot on the soundtrack for this season of HBO's Insecure.

From her Los Angeles home, Isley takes us on a tour of her discography, starting with ""About Him"" from 2013's Dreams in Analog and closing with her latest single, ""Gone."" But before we get to the finale, we're treated to the premiere of a brand new song, ""Rain Clouds,"" which was produced by 9th Wonder (a storied hip-hop producer that we recently featured on NPR's new songwriting series The Formula). Her luscious tone and perfectly placed runs send me straight to Zen whenever I hear them. Allow Alex Isley to take you there, too.

BUWpIou5yO0,Braxton Cook: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

May 8, 2020 | Sidney Madden -- Braxton Cook is a Juilliard-trained, genre-jumping artist whose music feels both contemporary and timeless. Even if you don't know him by name, fans of jazz-shaded Tiny Desk concerts will know his sound. Cook previously appeared at the Desk in support of Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah in 2015, Tom Misch in 2018 and Phony Ppl in 2019. This time around, Cook takes the center seat, so to speak, from the comfort and safety of his sunny New Jersey home.

For his Tiny Desk (home) concert, Cook jumped around his discography, performing tracks from his 2017 album, Somewhere in Between, all the way up to his latest project, 2020's Fire Sign. Cook says he usually performs his original work with a full band, but obviously that isn't an option in the time of social distancing. So instead, the ambidextrous talent uses loops to support his vocals, saxophone and guitar throughout the laidback set. Closing out this cozy session, Cook dedicates the stirring ""Hymn (for Trayvon Martin)"" to everyone affected by the current pandemic.

For this deeply moving Tiny Desk (home) set, recorded at her home in Los Angeles, MILCK performs those two recent singles, along with an unreleased track called ""Double Sided,"" a gorgeous tearjerker about the necessity of loving one another regardless of our faults and weaknesses. MILCK's songs of empowerment, unity and understanding have never resonated more.

May 5, 2020 | Suraya Mohamed -- Something special happens when Lianne La Havas performs an acoustic set. Our audience agrees; her first appearance at the Tiny Desk in 2015 is one of the most popular Tiny Desk Concerts of all time. We are thrilled to have her back, this time performing from her home in London.

She looks quite comfortable in her cozy space. I love the effect of the close camera placement; her essence penetrates the fourth wall like she's singing just for me. Lianne performed the tender ""Paper Thin"" and ""Bittersweet,"" two recent singles that will be included on her self-titled new album set to drop in July. The intimacy of the performance matches the lyrics of the new songs, personal vignettes about her life and growth over the last five years.

It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

May 1, 2020 | Lars Gotrich -- American guitarist Buck Curran has been in mandatory lockdown in Bergamo, Italy — ""the epicenter of the pandemic in Europe,"" he says — since early March. That's where, years ago, he met Adele Pappalardo while on tour, fell in love and started a family. They have a son about to turn three years old and another child due in August. ""We're trying to survive,"" Curran says. ""And be positive,"" Pappalardo adds. Soon residents in Italy will be allowed to use parks, visit relatives and attend funerals.

From their home, Buck Curran plays three songs from the recently released No Love is Sorrow with Adele Pappalardo on vocal harmony, plus ""New Moontide"" from 2016's Immortal Light. There's a burning darkness to these songs, as Curran's rough-hewn voice and droning psych-folk melodies curl like smoke, but there's also a desperate hope that cracks the surface.

He used the concert to share his inspiring philosophy of self-knowledge. Jeru drops lyrics about what it takes to achieve self-actualization in tough conditions for not just himself, but for the culture.

Jeru shares a medley of his classics including ""Can't Stop the Prophet"" and ""My Mind Spray,"" His prescient lyrics remain as relevant as ever as he addresses the deepening fissures of socioeconomic inequalities exposed by the coronavirus crisis. He closes his set from his home in Berlin with a new song, ""The Power,"" and offers up a message we all need: ""No matter who you are, the power resides in you...We can overcome anything if you put your mind to it, you just can't get in your mind too much.""

April 28, 2020 | Felix Contreras -- This unprecedented period of worldwide lockdown has halted public musical performances. But it has also inspired intimate performances by musicians directly from the places where they create their music.

The Mexican duo known as Rodrigo y Gabriela travel the globe playing to crowds who are captivated by their almost telepathic acoustic guitar interplay. But they make their home in Mexico in a sunny Pacific beach town called Zihuatanejo (remember The Shawshank Redemption?). For this performance we get a peek at their home studio, where they surround themselves with guitars and dress down in sneakers and casual clothes. They run through tunes from throughout their recorded history, including a song they played at the Tiny Desk back in 2009. Rodrigo y Gabriela's picking and strumming feel more relaxed than usual but maintains their intense focus.

April 22, 2020 | Bobby Carter -- Whenever I'm asked to name my favorite Tiny Desk concerts, Nick Hakim's 2018 performance sits near the very top. He and his four bandmates reset the bar for intimacy at the Desk with their hushed groove. That's why I was so excited to hear what he would do all alone from his home in Bushwick, Brooklyn.

The Washington, D.C. native played from the corner of his dark bedroom with a keyboard, guitar and stacks of audio components. His recording environment is just what I expected. He performs a three songs from his upcoming album WILL THIS MAKE ME GOOD: a haunting dedication to a fallen friend, ""QADIR,"" the newly released ""CRUMPY"" and the premiere of ""GODS DIRTY WORK."" He also shows off his peculiar sense of humor, activating a mini applause effect between songs, sipping his beverage right into the microphone and breaking into laughter. While he doesn't engage in much banter, the lyrics in songs like ""GODS DIRTY WORK"" are eerily fitting for this moment we're in.

Tom Huizenga | April 17, 2020 -- Here's something unique: a chance to eavesdrop on the superstar pianist Lang Lang at home. It's a place he rarely seems to be, but staying put is important to him during the coronavirus crisis, and he offers a personal performance to reflect on these trying times.

The 37-year-old pianist, who typically plays sold-out shows to thousands, says he's taking his recent solitary time to learn new repertoire at home in Shanghai, China. And home is where he thinks we should all be. ""It's very important that you have to stay at home please,"" he says from the piano, where he opens with Chopin's calming Nocturne No. 20 in C-sharp minor.

Lang Lang's latest passion is Bach – specifically the Goldberg Variations, a 75-minute-long cycle of immense complexity grounded in the composer's durable beauty. Lang Lang offers the 18th and 19th variations, pieces that in turn represent the strength of logic and the joy of the dance. It's music, Lang Lang says, that ""always brings me to play in another level of artistic thinking.""

April 1, 2020 | Bobby Carter --  After five-time Grammy winner Michael McDonald finished ""Matters Of The Heart,"" the opening song in his Tiny Desk (home) concert, there was a brief pause. The bewilderment on his face was unmistakable. It's a look I believe we all can relate to in this moment of uncertainty. He sat in his home studio, complete with an illustration of the Tiny Desk drawn by Mr. McDonald himself. That pause, usually reserved for the anticipated applause, was replaced by complete silence.

The 2020 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee then proceeded to play two 1978 Doobie Brothers classics that showcase his still-golden voice: ""Minute By Minute"" and ""What A Fool Believes."" ""If you know the words, sing along with me at home,"" he said. ""I won't know if you're singing well or not because I can't hear you here.""

I sang along, and so will you.

CfnM5aeH92Q,Margo Price & Jeremy Ivey: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (Home) Concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

March 26, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- Margo Price and her husband, Jeremy Ivey, performed a Tiny Desk (Home) Concert from their Nashville attic. Behind them are two handmade signs inspired by John Lennon and Yoko Ono's Bed-In For Peace that simply reads ""Stay Home"" and ""Save Lives."" In addition to the rapidly spreading virus, Nashville was recently ravaged by tornadoes. Margo and Jeremy are safely quarantined with two children, their dog and cat, and guitars in hand. They played ""Stone Me,"" a song they co-wrote and included on Margo's upcoming album, That's How Rumors Get Started.

Margo and Jeremy dedicated this concert to all those that are struggling right now and thank ""all the people still out there working, the doctors, all the sanitation people, everybody out there just doing what they have to do to so we can survive, all the people working in grocery stores. And to everyone who has lost their job, we feel you."" They ended the set with a premiere, a song called ""Someone Else's Problem,"" that they wrote together on an airplane while Margo was pregnant. It's a song dealing with the guilt many of us have, being part of a problem instead of part of a solution.

Nov. 8, 2019 | Rodney Carmichael -- Rather than squeezing in a stop by NPR's Washington D.C. headquarters between tour stops, the rapper Dave made a special trip all the way from the UK just for his Tiny Desk performance. If that isn't proof that it was a big deal, his nervousness before the show confirmed it. But he powered through in a performance that puts his gift for making the personal political on full display.

Behind Dave's British stoicism, you get an up-close look at the honest storytelling and stripped-down vulnerability that earned him a Mercury Prize in the UK for Psychodrama and an acting role in Netflix's crime drama reboot Top Boy. He blacks out, lyrically, with a four-piece band and background singer backing him after sharing the inspiration behind the aptly-titled song ""Black"" from his opus of a debut. ""It's just about the black British experience,"" he says. ""Everyone's experience of being black is a little bit different, but this is my take on it. I wanted to deliver it to the world and here it is for you guys.""

But the climax here comes near the end, when Dave takes a seat at the piano to accompany himself while rapping his 2018 hit, ""Hangman."" In the moment before he plays the opening keys, he pauses to take a breath before channeling the weight of the world through his fingers.

vdph2l0iw74,Roberto Fonseca: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | February 5, 2025
In Cuba, pianists explore the wonderful rhythms of the island with their own percussive sense of melody. From the very first song in Roberto Fonseca’s Tiny Desk, we’re reminded of the Afro-Cuban jazz tradition’s long history: Not only do we get a driving foundation but also the kinds of horn lines that have sounded since the 1940s when Afro-Cuban rhythms and jazz improvisation bumped into each other.

The best always make it look easy. These band members, in particular, look like they could do this in their sleep. But there is a slight shift in the musical personality of this performance when the band strips down to a quartet: Fonseca's mastery of the instrument fuels the fiery finale.

Felix Contreras | October 11, 2024
Sheila E. is a portrait of motion.

Not just the movement of her body as one of the world’s most recognized drummers, but also as a versatile musician who glides easily from genre to genre with the ease of a master. For her time behind the Desk, she assembled a team of musicians to play tracks from her first ever salsa album Bailar.

From the first notes of “Rumba Percussion Jam,” Sheila E.’s bona-fides performing true rumbera (traditional Afro-Cuban drumming and singing) are on full display with her conga chops. The entire set is a reflection of her long standing ability to meld Afro-Caribbean, jazz and funk into a danceable celebration that caps off with shots of tequila for her final track “Playa Tequila.”

Any amount of time spent with Sheila E. is a reminder that high caliber musicianship is always first and goes down easier when presented with the joyous energy of an icon.

Anamaria Sayre | October 9, 2024
Fresh off the release of its latest album Submarine, The Marías have never felt more ready-made for the Tiny Desk. With the first few chimes of the synth and notes from Maria Zardoya’s breathy vocals, the band makes it clear that there’s no better place to bring its bedroom pop style than this slightly bigger space.

The indie band has been skyrocketing over the last few years with classic Spanglish hits like “Cariño” (featured here at the Desk) and a collab on Bad Bunny’s Un Verano Sin Ti. But there’s so much more to the group than the smooth electronic beats and guitar riffs that meet the ear.

Headed by Puerto Rican lead singer Maria Zardoya, who proudly places a Puerto Rican flag on the Desk halfway through the show, there is an authenticity to the group’s lyricism and presentation that pulses just beneath the emotive keys. The band’s performance feels like a soundtrack for a generation that exists in many worlds, and in The Marías Tiny Desk viewers find a new, ethereal, welcoming world to belong to.

s9xYNeiSofM,Eladio Carrión: Tiny Desk Concert,"This Sept. 15 to Oct. 15, NPR Music celebrates artists from all corners of Latinidad with an 'El Tiny' takeover.

Anamaria Sayre | October 7, 2024
English language hip-hop and Latin trap exist in two separate dimensions; Kansas-born, Puerto Rico-raised Eladio Carrión embodies both and neither at once. That’s perhaps a poetic reflection of a childhood spent as a military brat, moving from state to state, across the country that colonized his family’s island before settling back in Humacao. At the Tiny Desk, Carrión wasted no time putting that multicultural flow on full blast. 

He kicked things off with a victory lap on “Gladiador,” leading straight into a keys-heavy arrangement of “Air France” and then the delightful staccato of “Tata” off his 2021 album Monarca. As if “Where my lil mamas at today?” wasn’t a perfect enough line to warm up the crowd, he carried on with the bilingual bars of “Hey Lil Mama,” seamlessly transitioning into a glorious trap-rock rendition of his 2022 hit “Mbappe.” Carrión’s studio collaborators include some of the biggest names in rap and reggaeton, but his only guest at El Tiny, rising Spanish singer Lia Kali, brought a new level of magnetism to the performance, demonstrating how the uncategorizable Carrión can’t help but keep us on our toes with his every move.

Anamaria Sayre | October 4, 2024
The Argentine power duo Ca7riel & Paco Amoroso breathe authenticity. They each came up in their own right in an urban scene buzzing with energy, ideas and true ingenuity.

Argentina is a country notorious for unabashed expression. The country has been rocked by some of the most notable music moments in Latin America, from the inception rock en español, to waves of extreme censorship on artistic expression. Contemporary artists take nothing for granted when it comes to showing up just as they are, and Ca7riel & Paco Amoroso are two of the most exciting artists doing so.

While heavily dependent on electronic sounds, they came to play at the Tiny Desk with an arrangement that whipped their typical beats into stirring drum taps and horn harmonies. Everything they touch turns to creative gold, spinning tracks with a unique silliness and magnetism. Their Tiny Desk is just another stop on the duo’s rise.

ZVEeAxeyAPU,Rita Payés: Tiny Desk Concert,"Anamaria Sayre | October 2, 2024
Admiration is the spellbinding tenor of Rita Payés’ Tiny Desk performance.

Flanked by mother Elisabeth Roma and husband Pol Batlle, the Spanish multi-instrumentalist’s presence at the Desk reflects the way she creates and lives her music: in the cradle of familial love.

Payés performs a variety of Spanish jazz that is contemporary and nimble in its delivery, yet leans heavily on tradition. Born to a musical family in the same coastal town in Northern Spain where she now resides, she was raised surrounded by deep, musical tradition which she was able to identify as ripe for revival.

Across earlier, softer songs composed alongside her mother, to her now more grandiose string-laden, percussively rich arrangements, authentically representing her home and creating music fit for intimate exchange is always central to Payés’ craft. In the longing trill of her trombone or her sweetest vocal note, a sense of generational respect and understanding is born anew in Payés’ revered harmonies.

1yJjALda0X4,Fabiola Méndez: Tiny Desk Concert,"This Sept. 15 to Oct. 15 NPR Music celebrates artists from all corners of Latinidad with an 'El Tiny' takeover.

Felix Contreras | September 30, 2024
The smile that erupts onto Fabiola Méndez’s face just as she launches into her first tune says everything about the joy she finds in making music that explores her culture.

Her instrument is the Puerto Rican cuatro, the national folk musical instrument of Puerto Rico. She started on the instrument at age 6 in her native Caguas, Puerto Rico, and carried it with her as her principal instrument for her studies at the prestigious Berklee School of Music in Boston.

What makes her take behind the Desk with her four piece band stand out is not just her dexterity on the instrument, but also how she incorporates tradition into a very contemporary musical setting. You can hear that musical vision and dedication to storytelling through both Méndez’s vocals and also in the song “Tributo A Mis Abuelos,” an instrumental that conjures up visions of the pastoral Puerto Rican countryside where the jibaro (rural) culture thrives.

In Méndez’s hands, the cuatro becomes not just an example of a rich, Afro-Caribbean culture, but also an instrument to spread joy.

Amamaria Sayre | September 26, 2024
Whether in a stadium of 75,000 or behind a desk in an office building, Ivan Cornejo sings two notes and the heart quiets. His voice invites harmony, reflection, llorando, gritando — whatever the listener needs to feel whole again.

The 20-year-old Mexican American has emerged as a happy anomaly in recent years — a singer-songwriter who not only captivates audiences with excruciatingly descriptive lyricism but also invokes an ancestral wisdom. Cornejo voices the pains of adolescence in styles and sounds that refuse to fit boxes; he communicates in a language that makes fans feel both different and true.

The singer, endearingly nervous at the Tiny Desk, found a perfect home in the intimate space for some rockier arrangements of his hit “Ya Te Perdí” and a softer performance of the genre-pushing “Baby Please.” He ends the show with a performance of “J.,” which he dedicates to the girl who broke his heart. In Cornejo’s infinite shades of blue, we all find ourselves a little grateful for heartbreak.

Spending time with the Afro-Cuban sounds of OKAN is to be immersed in the sounds of tradition mixed with the present.

Co-leaders Elizabeth Rodriguez and Magdelys Savigne lead their five-piece band through the melodic and rhythmic celebration of their heritage with a sense of fun that can mask the intensity of the musicianship.

From the opening chant of the group’s first number “Eshu Nigüe (Elegua),” all the way through “La Reina del Norte,” OKAN is another example of musicians who honor the role of tradition while stretching the boundaries of how that tradition is expressed. And I’m not mad at the fact that every song is another reason to dance.

wC6iA_C_KC8,"Daniel, Me Estás Matando: Tiny Desk Concert","This Sept. 15 to Oct. 15 NPR Music celebrates artists from all corners of Latinidad with an 'El Tiny' takeover.

Felix Contreras | September 20, 2024
From the opening flourish of its first song, the Mexican band Daniel, Me Estás Matando, aka DMEM, makes it obvious that the group is leaning into the drama and passion of the Latin song style known as bolero. In fact, with just a hint of a raised eyebrow, the band describes its own take as “Boleroglam.”

On DMEM’s first song, it’s as if lead vocalist, drummer and band namesake Daniel Zepeda is mustering up his last bit of emotional courage to spin this tale of heartbreak. Show business schtick aside, what impresses during the group’s turn behind the Desk is the high quality of musicianship from DMEM co-leader and guitarist Iván de La Rioja and the rest of the band. The four part harmonies in only the first two minutes of the opening song reinforce the “heart on the sleeve” emotions of the genre.

If you grew up with this style of boleros, you probably imagine a group of guys in neat, three-piece suits gathered around a mic or the table at your favorite Mexican restaurant. It’s the music of our parents but in the hands and voices of Daniel, Me Estás Matando, the agony of love with these intricate harmonies becomes intergenerational.

ZfbX3MAnJUM,Danny Ocean: Tiny Desk Concert,"This Sept. 15 to Oct. 15 NPR Music celebrates artists from all corners of Latinidad with an 'El Tiny' takeover.

Isabella Gomez Sarmiento | September 18, 2024
We had no idea, when we invited Danny Ocean to the Tiny Desk, that his concert would take place amidst another wave of political protests and violent repression in his native Venezuela. Despite the tumultuous timing, Danny and his band eased right into his lover boy pop anthems “Me Rehúso,” and “Volare.” The latter, kicked off by an ingenious jingle of plastic bottle caps, transformed into a beach-side serenade complete with a saxophone and singalong. Later, during a surprise percussion breakdown in the middle of “AMOR” from his latest album REFLEXA, the Tiny Desk magic couldn’t have been clearer: a studio-polished song took on new life because the band was clearly having fun just jamming out.

Then, Ocean paused to acknowledge the crisis unfolding back home. “Venezuela, I love you with my whole heart,” he said in Spanish. “Whatever it is we’re going through, I hope we can resolve it.” Off the cuff, he played the first half of “por la pequeña Venecia” off his EP venequia. NPR staffers and guests waved Venezuelan flags; some of us got teary-eyed. But just like that, Danny Ocean and his band kept the good vibes going. The moment is indicative of the balance the artist has always managed to strike: making universal music about love and heartbreak without losing sight of the larger human struggle for peace and justice.

1Pt-nLSMONI,Juanes: Tiny Desk Concert,"This Sept. 15 to Oct. 15 NPR Music celebrates artists from all corners of Latinidad with an 'El Tiny' takeover.

Felix Contreras | September 16, 2024
From the moment Colombian superstar Juanes started singing “Nada Valgo Sin Tu Amor,” we know we were in for something special.

He usually performs in arenas and stadiums all over the Spanish speaking world, but he brought his intensely personal songs to the Tiny Desk — and none of them lost their power of speaking directly to the heart.

A highpoint for me was when he converted his popular song “La Luz” into a Dominican merengue, complete with crowd singalong. But what brought the house down was his surprise encore of “A Dios Le Pido,” proving this performance celebrates the power of his artistry and the familiarity of his music in our lives.

PCgB07Yy6Xs,Álvaro Díaz: Tiny Desk Concert,"Anamaria Sayre | July 19, 2024
Puerto Rican rapper Álvaro Díaz’s fresh take on his greatest hits at the Tiny Desk brought all the sal and soul of the Isla to NPR.

Opening with jazzy piano and synth riffs that evoked a sweet ocean breeze on “Todo Bien,” he quickly set the tone for the concert, throwing a shout-out to his mama, the inspiration for the track. Switching to “Chicas de la Isla,” he used smooth, electric guitar and stunning background vocals for a rendition of the first song he ever made, conveying a relaxed energy fit for a jam with friends.

After years of collaborating with all kinds of Puerto Rican artists from Jowell & Randy to Bad Bunny and everyone in between, despite being center stage for his Tiny Desk, Díaz took the opportunity to share the space with a whole crowd of Tiny Desk veterans and newcomers from all across the island. The community feel of his music fueled the energy and excellence of every single musician he shared the Desk with.

Ever the queen of self-assured experimentation, Spanish-Argentine artist Nathy Peluso brought all of her genre-bending, vocal powerhouse energy to her Tiny Desk concert.

Playing with the flow of urban sounds and salsa beats, the singer showcased the most jazzy, feel-good, playful parts of her discography in the acoustic space. Hopping from up-tempo tracks like “LEGENDARIO” with leading percussion and bass, to the soulful and wildly skilled vocal performance of “ENVIDIA,” Peluso delivered a versed ode to Latin American and Spanish rhythms.
 
Peluso is a master of the unexpected, and from first note to last the concert represented what an artist can bring when they highlight the full breadth of their vision. Prepared to show the world what an Argentine-born, Spanish-raised artist can play with in a more wildly diverse Spanish-speaking diaspora than ever before, Peluso came and rompió.

zoAs0-nXPQM,Silvia Pérez Cruz: Tiny Desk Concert,"Anamaria Sayre | July 9, 2024
Spanish singer Silvia Pérez Cruz grew up in the cradle of magnificent extremes. Her hometown Palafrugell on the Costa Brava of the Mediterranean sea is renowned as much for its stunning turquoise waters and dazzling summer sun as it is for biting bitter winds and unforgiving winter nights.

Amidst that chaos her songs were born: brilliantly distinct little capsules of human experience. Whether singing about joy, pain, grief or curiosity, that duality between sunshine and gray skies is present in her work.

“Yo soy inescrutable (I am inscrutable),” she cries on “Salir distinto.” Her emotive, jazz-tinged voice and ’54 acoustic guitar (she picked it up at a vintage shop some years ago in New York) transcends time and physical space. “Yo prefiero el desastre / Y escucharte sin perjuicio (I prefer disaster / And to listen to you without prejudice),” she coos. And in this moment, she’s impossible to turn away from — a vessel for eons of melancholic Mediterranean secrets at the Tiny Desk.

v1VLZnBEw_M,María José Llergo: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | July 8, 2024
In the moment that María José Llergo took her place behind the Tiny Desk, those of us lucky enough to be in the audience (and now anyone who watches the video document it — lucky you) were transported to her native Andalusia in southern Spain, the traditional home of flamenco.

But the Spanish music scene that Llergo is part of is exploding with new energy, too. Her vocals are based in the Arab-influenced vocal trilling of cante jondo, but like many artists from Spain these days, she uses tradition as a springboard for stylistic mash-ups with hip-hop, R&B and jazz.

Her cross-genre expressions display a nuanced balance of her respect for the deeply-ingrained cultural influences left over from the 16th century that is her family background as well as 21st century music that is her day-to-day reality.

Llergo’s performance is propelled by a vivacious spirit, and her final song, “LO QUE SIENTO,” is a meditation on and homage to what it means to be a Spanish musician in this moment when the boundaries of genre and tradition can be both celebrated and expanded.

5G6q__7jQoU,Ana Tijoux: Tiny Desk Concert,"Anamaria Sayre | May 22, 2024
In the transfixing world of Ana Tijoux, joy and protest are perennial lovers. For three decades, the French-born Chilean rapper has traveled around the world, offering refuge for those seeking ways to sing of their outrage and heartbreak. At the Tiny Desk, she does the same, featuring tracks from across her catalog rich with cultural commentary and political critique.

Her first album in 10 years, Vida, teems with life. Blending danceable beats with her typical cutting delivery, she invites the listener to find her back where she started — living for the love of music and dancing for the love of life.

To close this performance, she conjures an enduring spirit of protest. During ""Vida,"" featuring guest vocalist Monica Blaire, Tijoux quotes a song by Víctor Jara: ""Yo no canto por cantar / Ni por tener buena voz / Canto porque la guitarra / Tiene sentido y razón."" The Chilean musician and activist was arrested, tortured and murdered by the military during the coup led by dictator Augusto Pinochet in 1973; Jara's song ""Manifiesto"" was released posthumously in 1974. Translated, Tijoux raps, ""I don't sing for the sake of singing / Or for having a good voice / I sing because the guitar / Has sense and reason.""

49zIojl1CM4,Luciana Souza: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | May 17, 2024
I’m not the first to say it: jazz and Brazilian music are like very close first cousins. There is a historical DNA connecting the two traditions, but also linked by harmonic construction, ample room for improvisation and plain old swing.

In Luciana Souza’s performance, all of the above is on display in the music from one of the most distinct voices in contemporary jazz. Backed by Trio Corrente from Brazil, Souza performs selections from their album Cometa, which received a 2024 Grammy nomination for best Latin jazz album. Souza’s performance is a master class in how to play with intensity while keeping the volume down to accommodate the Tiny Desk’s actual workspace.

To listen to Yasser Tejeda's music is to hear the past, present and future.

He is a gifted guitar player originally from the Dominican Republic and a graduate of the acclaimed Berklee College of Music. As you can see and hear in his turn behind the Tiny Desk, Tejeda is intentional about drawing on his ancestral background, his studies and his musical vision in his work. He deftly combines traditional Dominican music with jazz and rock in performances that move the hips as well as minds.

According to his notes prepared for this performance, ""En El Naranjo"" and ""Amor Congo"" are based on a traditional Dominican rhythm called ""congos del espiritu de santo de Villa Mella."" ""La Vereda"" is a fusion of a traditional style called ""Sarandunga de Baní"" with rock and jazz, while ""Todo Va A Marchar"" is his exploration of Congolese guitar and kompa from Haiti mixed with Dominican merengue.

There will not be a quiz given after you watch this performance, but the music of Yasser Tejeda and his talented band resonates so much more when you consider the history behind the passion of the performances.

R2_7ADO2Hlo,El Laberinto del Coco: Tiny Desk x globalFEST,"In 2021, the Tiny Desk x globalFEST series was created to promote international music discovery. For the last three years, artists from around the globe have performed Tiny Desk (home) concerts from their respective countries, but for the first time this year, artists performed at the Tiny Desk at NPR's headquarters.

Felix Contreras | April 5, 2024
The island of Puerto Rico has become known for various musical styles that have influenced not just Latin music, but also global musical trends. From the Afro Caribbean styles that make up the salsa boom of the 1970s, to the ""BOOM-chicka-BOOM"" of the reggaeton beat that came to dominate the charts, Puerto Rican musicians innovate while never straying far from tradition.

That idea inspired percussionist Hector ""Coco"" Barez to create the group El Laberinto del Coco, a genre-bending collective built around the folklore and rhythmic styles of bomba. The group's message is clear from the opening grooves of ""Se Vuelve Miel"" that Barez's vision is to dig deep into the African roots of call-and-response with four vocalists and four horn players to remind us throughout its performance of the power of bomba to create community.

Special mention should be made of the presence of musician Jerry Medina, a musical treasure and icon from the island who has performed with the biggest names in Afro Caribbean music as a vocalist and trumpeter — in this case adding voca rumba percussion and sound effects.

For the last three years, artists from around the globe have performed Tiny Desk (home) concerts from their respective countries, but for the first time this year, artists performed at the Tiny Desk at NPR's headquarters.

Felix Contreras | April 3, 2024
The first impression I get from watching the Spanish duo Tarta Relena at the Tiny Desk is a reminder that the human voice may be mankind's oldest musical instrument.

Even more so when you consider that the five languages they sing here includes not just Spanish, Greek and their native Catalan, but also Latin and classical Greek, evoking images of lyricists and vocalists from centuries past.

Starting initially as an a capella project in 2016, vocalists Helena Ros and Marta Torella eventually added ambient-styled electronics to cushion their uncommonly matched voices. The duo's first number, ""Me Yelassan,"" is in Greek, so be sure to activate the translation option on the video to fully appreciate the power of the performance with lyrics read almost like a Zen koan meditation on rebirth and eternity.

Stay tuned in to those translations, because the magic of this performance is in losing yourself in the harmonies and timeless poetic lyrics. In fact, the lyrics of the song ""Safo"" are taken from a poem written by the ancient Greek poet Sappho, and includes the prophetic line: ""Someone will remember us, I say even in another time."" How often do we get a chance to consider our place in history set to such stunning vocals?

o4Iv7k0aQoc,Kevin Kaarl: Tiny Desk Concert,"Anamaria Sayre | January 8, 2024
Singer-songwriter Kevin Kaarl applies his indie-drenched vocals with an entirely new vision at his Tiny Desk concert. Pairing folksy, trumpet rhythms with twangy banjo, the Chihuahuan artist transfigures traditional Sinaloan instrumentation into styles more recognizable among American folk bands.

Opening with ""Me Va a Costar,"" twin brother and trumpet player Brian spins sweet harmony on the track. Transitioning to the guitar and banjo-driven, trumpet adorned ""Te Quiero Tanto,"" Kaarl strings together romantic melodies with endlessly rich vibratos and stunning falsetto.

He switches to one of his earliest hits, the relentlessly romantic ""Vámonos a Marte."" ""Vámonos de viaje a las estrellas y a Marte (Let's go on a trip to the stars and Mars),"" he coos, ""A olvidar nuestros problemas, tan punzantes (To forget our stinging problems).""

He pauses to leave a regalo (one of his boots, and he confirmed he walked home with one foot shoeless after doing so) and then ends with the folky ""San Lucas"" — a track fit for any indie king.

Multi-faceted in his lyricism and vocal abilities, Kevin Kaarl took his banda Sinaloense roots and shined in performing a style that virtually none in his part of the world are playing with, innovating and smiling all the while.

wzlZ68ts-IU,Marta Pereira da Costa: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | November 15, 2023
From the very first beat in this performance, it's clear we are being transported to another time and space with Marta Pereira da Costa's enchanting time behind the Tiny Desk.

Considered to be the first and only woman to professionally master the traditional Portuguese guitar used in fado music, Pereira da Costa caught my attention in a crowded bar in Austin, Texas in 2019 during South by Southwest. In fact, with echoes of Bob Boilen and Stephen Thompson's experience with Laura Gibson that gave birth to the Tiny Desk concert, I also wanted to hear Pereira da Costa's melodic fingerpicking prowess without the noisy crowd.

Accompanied by second guitarist João José Pita Junior and percussionist Pedro Segundo, the trio bridges centuries of history with immaculate playing and plenty of smiles. As Pereira da Costa states in between songs, the entire performance is a musical journey through her homeland, from land to sea and everything in between.

Fado has achieved international recognition outside of Portugal among the musically curious, and I usually associate it with a variety of renowned vocalists. But Pereira da Costa reminds us to pay attention to the accompanists and their instruments for a deeper appreciation of tradition and music made in the moment.

P_yPDiMN3uk,Maluma: Tiny Desk Concert,"Anamaria Sayre | October 20, 2023

Maluma, baby. Literally.

The Colombian superestrella's debonair smile and mesmerizing vocals were as captivating as ever during his El Tiny performance, yet nothing could draw the spotlight away from the three little words proclaimed boldly across his chest: ""Papa de Paris."" Of all the titles Maluma has donned — Don Juan, Papi Juancho — none have ever been worn with more pride.

Maluma on becoming a new dad and using music to defy stereotypes about Colombia
""Esa cancion ... se la compuse a alguien y es bien bonito tenerlas aquí,"" the singer said in Spanish, teasing the announcement of his soon-to-be-born baby girl ahead of a teary-eyed performance of ""ADMV."" Mama, who was present in the crowd, was clearly center-stage in the artist's brain as he cast loving glances in her direction throughout the emotional set.

Tears didn't stop Maluma from bringing in the hits, from notorious banger ""Hawái"" to recent regional record-breaker ""Según Quién,"" he showed off his stylistic diversity and vocal dynamism by laying smooth melodies over a rock solid band featuring a string section and masterful percussion.

As a surprise extended ending to our heritage month celebration, Maluma closed things out in true Latino fashion — with pride, tears and familia.

FftvVi42U4o,Becky G: Tiny Desk Concert,"This Latinx Heritage Month Tiny Desk is celebrating with an 'El Tiny' takeover, featuring a wide array of artists from all corners of Latinidad.

Felix Contreras | October 13, 2023
The Tiny Desk had a considerable pop sheen when vocalist Becky G took her place alongside a backing band featuring a string quartet. The stripped down sound of some of her biggest hits offered a rare view of her artistry.

""BAILÉ CON MI EX"" is the perfect example of an unforgettable hook. It had the NPR staff audience bopping in place for what she described as a ""warm up"" for the rest of her set. ""MAMII"" was originally recorded with Karol G, but performed alone, and the Tiny Desk version was no less a scorcher. Here, interplay with guitarist Justice West at the beginning set the temperature for a slow burn.

The showstopper is her duet with vocalist DannyLux, ""CRIES IN SPANISH,"" a song they did together on her latest album, Esquinas. I have to admit that when he started his part of the song, it was apparent that their voices were kind of made for eachother. And by the time she obliged us with her Tiny Desk concert take on ""Shower,"" she had cast her spell: I ended up singing that chorus for the rest of the day.

7EAM4pxxL4Y,Ivy Queen: Tiny Desk Concert,"This Latinx Heritage Month Tiny Desk is celebrating with an 'El Tiny' takeover, featuring a wide array of artists from all corners of Latinidad.

Stefanie Fernández | October 11, 2023
""La gente tiene la patita del conejo / y yo tengo a Benito completo,"" Ivy Queen quips, lighting a candle featuring Bad Bunny at an El Tiny altar to reggaeton (""People have the rabbit's foot / I have all of Benito."") Even her jokes flow. Thanks to far more than luck, ""La Caballota"" has carried and passed the torch since the '90s with an ironclad sense of self and unwavering commitment to the women and femmes she writes for.

And she's done it in no uncertain terms. After a propulsive performance of ""La Vida es Así,"" she soberly says that women are judged no matter what. For a long time, she was the most visible canvas upon which projections of women in reggaeton were placed, and her talent was nurtured from within. ""Yo sabía que a mi no había que darmela porque yo la tenía,"" she later notes. (""I knew that it didn't have to be given to me because I had it."") The road has widened, not without a struggle.

Finally, she addresses the mujeres directly for the song. ""Tenemos derecho a ser feliz, tenemos derecho a cambiar, a cuidarnos, a protegernos,"" she exhorts. (""We have the right to be happy, we have the right to change, to take care of ourselves, to protect ourselves."") ""Quiero Bailar,"" two decades later and literally performed behind a desk, feels as urgent and insurgent now. Or, as she puts it, simply: ""Guys, this is for the girls."" With Ivy Queen, it always has been.

October 6, 2023 | Isabella Gomez Sarmiento

Villano Antillano kicked off her Tiny Desk Concert with a Britney Spears-approved message: Dump. Him.

""Yo Tengo un Novio,"" off the Puerto Rican rapper's debut LP, La Sustancia X, called out the toxic, controlling expectations of one of her ex-jevos. Through her sharp Caribbean flow, Antillano broke down the confines of monogamy in her first song before casting light on drug use and escapism as a means of queer survival in ""Kaleidoscópica.""

Throughout her performance, Antillano showed why she's one of the most exciting voices in Latin trap and reggaeton right now. She flaunted her sexual prowess on ""Cuero,"" and ""Cáscara de Coco,"" then intentionally honored her religious upbringing and place in the church, which she noted isn't always a welcoming space for LGBTQ+ communities. The artist keeps proving that socially conscious lyricism and unfiltered joy can — and should — go hand-in-hand.

Felix Contreras | October 4, 2023
Alex Cuba starts his turn behind the Tiny Desk with the barest of musical essentials: a percussive guitar rhythm, the soft scratch of a güiro and a miniature choir. ""Ciudad Hembra (La Habana),"" a lament for his hometown, sets a deliberate slow burn for this performance.

Alex Cuba's superpower is his undeniable charm as he weaves evocative imagery into musical arrangements that not only call to mind his native Cuba but anywhere an acoustic guitar and engaging voice command attention. ""De Camino'' offers a good case in point. Propelled by bass, drums and congas, the deeply personal love song is full of celebration — Cuba's guitar and light hand percussion remind us that we are, in fact, in the Caribbean.

""Chekere"" is named for the Afro-Cuban instrument made of a dried-out gourd covered by beads used in all types of Cuban music. The song's soft beginning evolves into a percussion-inspired explosion before Alex Cuba segues into a delicate love song dedicated to his wife, ""Sarah.""

AynDvSkZ8og,DannyLux: Tiny Desk Concert,"This Latinx Heritage Month Tiny Desk is celebrating with an 'El Tiny' takeover, featuring a wide array of artists from all corners of Latinidad.

Stefanie Fernández | September 27, 2023
""Amar y perder es mejor que nunca haber amado,"" DannyLux sings — ""To love and lose is better than to have never loved."" His reflection is hushed and hesitant, and, maybe even more wisely, a little unconvinced: ""Crеo que no entiendеs / Que esta situación me está cambiando,"" he croons. (""I don't think you understand / That this situation is changing me."")

He's really good at laying these paradoxes out plainly. But seated at 'El Tiny' between his cousin Eddy on bass and lifelong friend Victor also on guitar, the quiet 19-year-old is grounded and sure, looking back on his childhood and the daydreams that led him to become a sierreño star. Between each song, he notes a piece of his story, from being born in Palm Springs, Calif. to his parents' favorite music to writing songs in his room after his siblings left home. The Chicano singer has experienced a dizzying ascent to fame since his TikTok star rose in 2020, infusing a variety of Mexican regional genres with a distinctly online moodiness and honesty. He sings straightforward lyrics for unsimple feelings; his tender performance of ""TE EXTRAÑO Y LO SIENTO..."" captures the closeness of those feelings as they're unfolding.

For his last surprise, the trio expands to include two charchetas for closer ""ATRAPADO,"" a joyful rendition of a truly sad song; exquisitely, the horns hit right on the word ""obsesionado."" For someone whose music is so centered around yearning, Danny's performance is incredibly present, grounded in this moment of community with all the attendant gratitude and wonder that comes with a sound and artistic identity forged with family and friends.

Anamaria Sayre | Septemeber 22, 2023
J Noa buzzes with power. Standing cara a cara with the 17-year-old Dominican rapper, it's clear that spinning life experiences into buttery smooth, striking bars is as natural for her as it is for most of us to take a breath.

This Tiny Desk concert was her first time ever leaving her barrio to perform, and yet she transmitted the confidence and charisma of an artist who invokes generations of fuerza into every word she breathes. Setting the tone with ""No Me Puedan Parar,"" she brought captivating energy to the cool anthem. Switching to ""Autodidacta,"" she backed her self-taught narrative with mind-blowing verbal sprints. Gliding through the jazz-backed ""Paranoia"" to story-driven ""Betty,"" her delivery was so powerful that even the stories she told in between tracks felt like carefully placed poetry.

Desde el DR para romper el Tiny Desk. Don't get it twisted — J Noa came to the Tiny Desk to show the world what a girl from her barrio is capable of. Respira, romper — desde DR pa el mundo, the world isn't ready for her.

CbotsXwCbNE,Rawayana: Tiny Desk Concert,"This Latinx Heritage Month Tiny Desk is celebrating with an 'El Tiny' takeover, featuring a wide array of artists from all corners of Latinidad.

Isabella Gomez Sarmiento | September 19, 2023
This Latinx Heritage Month Tiny Desk is celebrating with an 'El Tiny' takeover, featuring a wide array of artists from all corners of Latinidad.

No Venezuelan party is complete without tequeños. Whether it’s a wedding or a baptism, the cheese-filled treats are a must-have at every snack table — so it makes sense Rawayana pulled up to “El Tiny” with a box to share.

Kicking things off with hits from the band’s 2016 album, Trippy Caribbean, the Caracas-formed group brought its infectious energy and beach-infused sound to the NPR office. The reggae-groove that defined early songs soon turned into something more expansive, putting a Caraqueño spin on funk, merengue, rock and hip-hop. Rawayana’s set — which included two singles from the forthcoming album, ¿Quién trae las cornetas? — perfectly illustrated how the band’s sound stretches and plays off of musical movements from around the Caribbean diaspora to create something new altogether. 

For more than a decade, Rawayana has been at the forefront of a younger generation of Venezuelan artists that grew up under the country’s socioeconomic crisis. At its Tiny Desk performance, it showcased just how much talent has come out of Venezuela during that time — bringing friends and collaborators like Apache, Irepelusa, Orestes Gómez, Joel Martínez and Eric Chacón to perform — and how much joy and gozadera is still left in store.

jjA7vj3_Htk,Yahritza y Su Esencia: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | August 24, 2023
If you close your eyes at the beginning of this Tiny Desk concert, you could easily imagine yourself at a party somewhere along the Texas-Mexican border around the 1930s, just after the guitars come out. But open your eyes and you'll see Yahritza y Su Esencia, a trio of musicians from Washington's Yakima Valley, belting out songs about lost love and longing.

Such is the magic of the current wave of Mexican regional music. Yahritza Martínez's voice on ""Soy El Unico"" speaks to a new generation of Mexican music fans as deeply as some of us old timers. Surrounded by her brothers Armando, on 12-string guitar, and Jairo, on bass, Martínez's impassioned vocals speak of loving someone who does not return the favor. There is an art to singing the kind of impassioned lyrics that are found in the corridos and rancheras of the best Mexican regional music and Yahritza does it again on ""Dejalo Ir,"" another song she wrote when she was 13 years old.

I was doing okay until the group hit its stride with ""No Se Puede Decir Adiós"" when I had a moment. My mom loved rancheras and corridos and having recently lost her, I had to sit down at my desk during the performance and have a private, quiet cry. So don't hold back, and give yourself up to the powerful emotion of Yahritza y Su Esencia's performance.

Rmg040Su5R8,Omar Montes: Tiny Desk Concert,"Anamaria Sayre | August 17, 2023
Shrouded in all black, flamenco garb and flanked by his very own angelitos at the Tiny Desk, Spanish singer Omar Montes is the shining embodiment of the contrasts he constantly plays with. 

Dancing along the border of tradition and modernity — flamenco and hip hop — the artist recounts his story as a kid of Roma heritage growing up on the streets of Madrid, over the melodic heartbeat of clapping hands. Opening the show with “Patio de la Cárcel,” he trades synthetic beats for transitive horns and lays bare his soul with vivid bars about life in his barrio. Locking in his audience with a heart-thumping trombone line, he switches to flamenco-driven “Metió en un Lío.” Settling back into the beat of clapping hands, he and his band dance through the up-tempo “La Llama del Amor.” 

Omar Montes walked into the building on a video call with his grandma — one of the most important people in his life. He closes out his performance with “Conmigo,” infused with the kind of romance you’d imagine his abuela taught him. “For you I would bring down the moon,” he coos. The Spanish artist exudes tradition and soul as he centers his barrio, his people, his familia in his show — bringing a little piece of Spain to the rest of the world.

O0sUBp7ps8k,Gregorio Uribe: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | August 4, 2023
One of the many musical manifestations of the history of Latin America is the arrival of the European accordion. And in the hands of Colombian musician Gregorio Uribe, the accordion is both a melodic and rhythmic wonder. As he launches into ""Damasco"" with his two musical partners, Jonathan Gomez on percussion and Andres Garcia on bass, images of the lush Colombian countryside push through the bright melodies of the accordion and Uribe's impassioned vocals.

The performance is an explosion of both folkloric vallenatoand cumbiaand. as Uribe explains, the lively rhythms can often defy the seriousness of the lyrics — he describes ""Atlas""as an existential crisis set to a very danceable rhythm. ""Media Naranja"" explodes into a percussive jam session and ""Ay Leonardo"" evolves into a joyful singalong as Uribe demonstrates how the spirit of Colombian folk music becomes universal in the right hands.

LJdWpAFutYM,Kany García: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | July 24, 2023
What's an artist to do when, instead of standing and dancing before a stadium of adoring fans, she's instead sitting behind the Tiny Desk?

You do exactly what Puerto Rican vocalist Kany García does: dig deep into the intimacy of her songwriting and the musicality of one of the most distinctive voices in any form of Latin music.

The first track, ""Para Siempre"" perfectly embodies a seductive declaration of togetherness with lyrics like: ""I want to be the desire that brings you home every night."" In ""Mundo Inventado,"" the full power of her songwriting has me lost in my feels, as she sings of the plight of all immigrants everywhere who leave the known for the unknown. (Where is my tissue? I have something in my eye.)

She closes the set with her song whose profane title can't be written out fully but is as common as the sound of traffic across Latin America: ""DPM (De Pxta Madre)."" In García's masterful hands it becomes a colorful way to express the ups and downs of emotions of even the briefest romantic episode.

If there was ever any doubt that García brings the skills of one of the best lyricists of Latin America to the world of Spanish pop music, this performance proves it. It feels like she is singing her very personal messages of desire and longing just for me.

Uh, I mean, for all of us.

btiE3ASfUUE,MARO: Tiny Desk Concert,"Anamaria Sayre | July 13, 2023
As captivating as birds who sing in sync, MARO's guitar trio brought an almost imperceptible, natural beauty to her Tiny Desk, characteristic of an artist truly in her element.

It makes sense that the Portuguese guitarist and singer-songwriter would feel at home in this space given her previous visit to the Desk as a featured player and vocalist in Jacob Collier's Tiny Desk concert. Beyond that, the artist came ready-made for the platform, prepared to lay bare a transfixing expression of bilingual heartbreak, strung together by the seamless narration of three acoustic guitars.

Opening with ""há-de sarar,"" the singer invited the listener to participate in her journey of heartbreak with sing-songy guitar harmonies and gently ebbing Portuguese vocals. Transitioning to ""just wanna forget you,"" MARO reminded the audience of the raw emotionality of her lyricism, trading languages to emphasize the melancholic guitar rhythms, weaving a tale she suggested most can relate to. Finishing with ""can you see me?"" and ""I SEE IT COMING,"" she encouraged everyone to join in singing, inserting whatever lyrics or sounds they felt compelled to add.

At every stage of her performance, she reminded the listener that regardless of language, culture or place, within a few weeping guitars and mesmerizing vocals lies some deeply and universally felt truths.

m9jHZ_pa2PM,Meridian Brothers: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | July 7, 2023
You gotta love a band that names itself after siblings that don't exist, and under a name that doesn't match anyone in the band. At least I do.

I've been a fan of the edgy sonic traditions of the Meridian Brothers for a while now, and jumped at the chance to bring the duo's space age cumbia direct from Bogotá, Colombia to the Tiny Desk. And band leader Eblis Alvarez did not disappoint.

Right from the start, the band's cumbia-infused grooves floated beneath almost otherworldly electronic keyboard sounds in ""Guaracha U.F.O.,"" eventually incorporating Alvarez's signature, sly ""I know something you don't""-style vocals. It's easy to be tricked by the eccentricities of the instrumentation and the offbeat vocal stylings, but Alvarez is a man with a vision, using his vast knowledge of Colombian folk and pop music to do things like pay tribute to an imaginary salsa band that never existed, as he did on its last album.

Things were very real during the group's turn behind the Desk, as he and his band challenged the audience to bring along what they knew to meet him in his world of recycled beats — played by his dedicated crew of Colombian musicians — off-kilter vocals and imaginative storytelling lyrics on ""¿Dónde Estás María?""

He and his band pulled off a powerful version of ""Bomba Atómica"", a sort of calling card that speaks to Alvarez being influenced by the rich history of Colombian cumbia and surf rock guitar, for a song that is essentially a frantic warning of the end of the world. Alvarez acknowledged the audience's appreciation with two raised fists, as if to celebrate how the real world dipped their toes into his realm of the imaginary, and everyone was better for it.

KUm6f0QJ_FI,Omar Sosa & Seckou Keita SUBA Trio: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | July 5, 2023
We've had hundreds of different voices and instruments behind the Tiny Desk over the years, but to my ears the performance that featured Omar Sosa and Seckou Keita sounded as if it was dropped directly from the heavens of musical compatibility right into our laps.

From the very start of ""Allah Léno,"" the notes began to sprinkle down like soft snowflakes from Sosa's piano and Keita's magnificent 24-string West African kora, while percussionist Gustavo Ovalles' tasteful drumming percolated beneath the interplay of Sosa and Keita. Proving once again that the Tiny Desk space is sacred ground for musical inspiration, barely four minutes in, Keita ended an inspired run with a huge smile acknowledged by his bandmates as well as those lucky enough to be in the NPR Music offices that day.

The title of the second song ""Kharit"" means ""friendship"" in the Senegalese language wolof and it starts with Ovalles' spellbinding, rhythmic work with traditional Venezuelan maracas. It starts at a relaxed pace but picks up speed with intuitive interaction between Sosa and Keita.

The last song ""Maam"" is devoted to ""all mothers,"" a sentiment that cuts across borders. This is truly an international band with Sosa hailing from Cuba, Keita from Senegal and Ovalles from Venezuela and the song titles are a mix of Arabic and west African wolof. And for about twenty, glorious minutes, the Tiny Desk was a weigh station along an ancient musical route connecting our imaginations with the vision of a truly remarkable trio.

D8UWsFMVj_Q,Karol G: Tiny Desk Concert,"Anamaria Sayre | May 15, 2023
Arriving at the Tiny Desk not long after becoming the first female artist to have a Spanish-language album top the Billboard 200 chart, Colombian singer Karol G shined brighter than ever. With an all-female crew backing her, the proud energia femenina and the prowess of a band dominated exclusively by women is undeniably brilliant here. It was also the first time in many years, she said, that she hadn't rehearsed without her typical on-stage equipment, like in-ear monitors. ""I forgot how cool it feels,"" she said. Authenticity isn't a prescription for Karol G, it's a natural state — something that she carries with her, waiting for the next opportunity to reveal another version of Carolina.

""CAROLINA,"" her given name, was also the title of the opening track of her performance, as she got to jamming in a manner atypical for the superstar. Trading her flute and trumpet for an accordion and tuba she ""bring[s] some Mexican vibe to this place,"" she said, with ""GUCCI LOS PAÑOS."" She paused between songs and offered a cheers to the room, admitting that she had meant to sip her Mezcalito before the previous song.

She emphasized the rawness of the moment by slowing things down for a stripped down, reggae-leaning version of ""PERO TÚ."" Sliding seamlessly into a bossa nova-esque ""MERCURIO"" — the version she wishes she'd included on the album — ""La Bichota"" brought the music back up and danced herself off stage. Away from the stadium lights, Karol G's performance wasn't just a blip of normalcy for the pop star — it was permission from the self-described ""happy-heartbreak girl"" to get up, whether in the streets of Medellín or an office in Washington, D.C., and dance with every version of yourself.

With a Dr. Simi doll in front of him, pop cariño Cuco brought every single piece of who he is and his artistry to El Tiny.

Slow-rolling through a set of four tracks, he seamlessly blended the soul of chicano ballads and the smooth energy of soft rock anthems. Opening with gentle vocals and simple chords on “Pendant,” Cuco brought corazon from an earlier era to his concert. Closing out the emo moment with a sweet guitar solo, he moved on to the tranquil percussion of “Hydrocodone,” delivering heartbroken melody and transporting the audience back to the bedroom where his songwriting career first began. 

Complementing the rumbling bass with some light synth, he showcases that same soulful energy on “Feelings,” and closes out the set with the bumpy, bilingual new track “Under the Sun,” shifting to cumbia rhythms as he swaps languages. The guitar-heavy, percussive-laden show invites the audience to share in a Cuco we’ve never seen before, all parts heartbroken, hopeful, and evolving.

FCjsmZlwSzA,Claudia Acuña: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | April 17, 2023
Claudia Acuña's art comes from a deep and spiritual place. From her native Chile, she has channeled her passion for jazz vocals into a career that most recently included a superb album of duets with other jazz A-listers. 

She starts her turn behind the Desk with an almost ceremonial incantation of purpose with her song ""Yo,"" which translates to ""I Am."" Serenaded by the heartbeat-like rhythm of a South American bombo léguero and the delicate strings of a cuatro, it’s a fitting introduction to her three song set. Her bilingual performance slips into English with ""That's What They Say,"" which displays her skills at interpretation, the foundation of the best jazz singing. The band's subtle shift to an uptempo samba at the end also features a genre-bending piano sólo by Pablo Bergara. 

One thing the best jazz vocalists do is create a space in which their voice takes on a deep musical quality, like a horn or other melodic instruments.  That’s on full display in Acuña’s next tune, ""Hey,"" a song dedicated to the power of women. Surrounded by bandmates like bassist Carlos Henderson and drummer Yayo Serka, Claudia Acuña has assembled the perfect cast of conspirators to help her leave a lasting impression of her art on the jazz world.

JxEvAHLqryg,Jorge Glem and Sam Reider: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | March 6, 2023
It’s a very special thing when two musical cultures come together to create something that didn’t exist before. That’s exactly what we got to witness in this performance from Venezuelan cuatro master Jorge Glem and extraordinary accordionist Sam Reider, as they set up behind the Desk for a set of highly creative, original music from their project Brooklyn Cumaná.

Glem’s dexterity on the small, traditional guitar-like instrument is evident from the very first notes of “Skeleton Rag,” as he plucks out a percussive, staccato pattern that is more Brazilian than the sweeping strums of Venezuelan folk music, as Reider leans into a melody that could easily be folkloric if it wasn’t something he dreamed up. Even as they end the tune at a breakneck speed, it’s only the beginning of the fireworks. “Sábana Blanca y Fuga con Estribillo” which follows, is based on a traditional Venezuelan folk tune and eventually erupts into a rustic exhibition of Glem’s vocals.

After a brief explanation in Spanish about the traditional song forms they work from, the duo eases into “Malagueña Cumanesa,” a lament based on a memory from Glem’s childhood.
“Coroticos” is a fiery exercise in an odd time meter that is actually part of Venezuelan tradition and it’s a showcase for how these two virtuoso musicians test the limits of their instruments while they expand our expectations of the accordion and cuatro. The magic of this music is watching both artists completely enjoy each other’s playing, with knowing glances and spontaneous vocal encouragement.

wTqCthvtL8k,Hermanos Gutiérrez: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | January 31, 2023

There is a slow burning intensity to everything Hermanos Gutiérrez does, including how the duo walked into our offices and saw the Tiny Desk for the first time. “Wow, there it is…” Estevan said quietly to his brother Alejandro.

Hermanos Gutiérrez’s origin story is as intricate as the guitar playing styles of its two members. The brothers have roots in both Switzerland and Ecuador, and the time spent in those two very distinct cultures and geographies gives their sound a tempered European coolness, coupled with a warm, playful energy. From the opening strains of “El Bueno Y El Malo” the brothers’ turn behind the Desk is the perfect introduction to their music if you don’t already know them — and a treat if you already do.

They weave intricate guitar lines over each other that intertwine to the point that if you close your eyes you can’t tell where one begins and the other ends. With a slight touch of a digital loop pedal, Estevan even sneaks in an entire percussion section on bongo and cowbell on “Tres Hermanos.” When my Alt.Latino co-host Anamaria Sayre and I interviewed them on the  podcast last year, I notice that they converse very much like they play: their comments intertwine and layer upon each other’s in the same way they play in unison and against each other in songs like “Thunderbird” and “Pueblo Man.”

M6Rh-CzEo24,The Mavericks: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | December 12, 2022
When The Mavericks brought their long-running tour to the Tiny Desk, we could hear a well-oiled musical machine that has charmed audiences long enough to earn the band a lifetime achievement award from the Americana Music Association.

From the opening strains of ""Back In Your Arms Again,"" we are treated to one of the best voices in the U.S. — that of Raul Malo. Backed by a smooth shuffle, Malo's voice is propelled by the subtle horn blasts that suggest a Tex-Mex border feel, driven home by the accordion.

""Mujer"" is a track from the band's 2020 album, its first album of all-Spanish material, which features the band's personality shifting from Americana shuffles to Mexican wedding boleros.

""Come Unto Me"" is a Mavericks chestnut and gives a glimpse into why the band is such a crowd favorite. The song filters that bolero feel of the previous song into a slow burner with a shouted chorus at the end that usually has the crowd on its feet and singing along.

The Mavericks are one of the best live shows out on the road these days and masters at bringing new fans into their fold. This performance gives us all a good idea of how the band weaves that magic.

xNm2JuN2WLQ,Farruko: Tiny Desk Concert,"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Latinx Heritage Month with an El Tiny takeover, featuring Jessie Reyez, Susana Baca and more musicians from all corners of Latinidad.

Fi O'Reilly | October 14, 2022
Last year, Farruko's song ""Pepas"" felt almost omnipresent. The bacchanalian party anthem for getting trashed at the club seemed to blast out from every passing car and bodega I walked by. But since releasing the song, Carlos Reyes aka Farruko, has undergone a spiritual transformation, even renouncing the song's message and taking the time to focus on his family and his developing relationship with God.

His Tiny Desk reflects this new perspective. At NPR HQ, Farruko adapted his quintessential flow to a much more intimate setting, one that highlights the striking pivot from the party-filled lifestyle described in so much of his earlier catalog. Instead of musings on drugs, perreo and excess, he opens his set with ""En La Mía (Remix)"" — an introspection on the healing power of music and faith — before moving onto a (revised) rendition of ""Pepas,"" that concentrates on the limitations of fame and staying true to yourself.

He emphasizes the importance of counting your blessings in ""No Entienden,"" reflecting on past mistakes in ""My Lova"" and the new track ""Viaje"" and spreading positivity in ""Gracias (Remix)."" It's an ideal send-off for this year's Latinx Heritage Month — blessings por nuestras herencias and hope for the future.

abb3ObvdBus,Tokischa: Tiny Desk Concert,"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Latinx Heritage Month with an El Tiny takeover, featuring Jessie Reyez, Susana Baca and more musicians from all corners of Latinidad.

Stefanie Fernández | October 12, 2022 
Tokischa came to NPR with a set of arrangements which, a conversation after the performance, she called ""a little more Tiny,"" reworking her dembow tracks in a melange of other Caribbean and Latin American genres. True to her identity as an artist whose performance is aimed squarely at disarming respectability politics, she doesn't sanitize the originals. Instead, her performance subverts expectations by foregrounding her celebration of female sexual autonomy, queerness and desire against a backdrop of popular folk genres. The juxtaposition succeeds uncannily, the kind of artistic strength that lands on the ears of people in power like a threat.

The dembow avant-gardist has incensed conservative pundits in the Dominican Republic and abroad. Her unfiltered expression has sparked moral panic and, elsewhere, drawn justifiable criticism. She opens with ""Perra"" — a collaboration she originally recorded with J Balvin and the video for which was criticized for racist imagery against Black women and was eventually deleted from YouTube. It's a surprising choice for an opener, even more so as a demure bossa nova. Tokischa lilts the song's chorus and playfully points to the audience.

Her distinctive voice and flow pair deftly with the switch-ups across Caribbean genres, from a bachata version of ""Hola"" to reggae on ""Somos Iguales"" and a mambo ""Delincuente,"" the latter complete with a call-and-response that features an NPR audience for the first time probably ever responding ""bellaca"" (""horny"").

""ESTILAZO"" is completely transformed, the crisp house original slowed to a languid son backed by a tumbao piano riff in the neighborhood of ""Chan Chan."" The lyrics — among them ""Lesbianismo entre mujeres, larga vida homosexual,"" (""Lesbianism between women, long homosexual life"") and ""Música con letras sucias, una suciedad divina"" (""Music with dirty lyrics, a divine filthiness"") — build like a manifesto, recasting what oppressors have deemed perverse as divine instead.

Each song is a surprise, and most of all the closer, ""Kilos De Amor,"" a currently unreleased corrido. The genre experiments aren't just an El Tiny detour, but a signifier of an artist who both deeply knows where she comes from and who isn't afraid to see how far she can go.

aKWV7b3j5P0,Carla Morrison: Tiny Desk Concert,"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Latinx Heritage Month with an El Tiny takeover, featuring Jessie Reyez, Susana Baca and more musicians from all corners of Latinidad.

Felix Contreras | October 7, 2022
The magic of Carla Morrison’s music is in the intimacy of her lyrics and her voice. I’ve seen the Mexican singer-songwriter woo small audiences and large crowds with an elegance that’s only grown since her first releases.That power to mesmerize is on full display during her time behind the desk with four songs that draw on the things that have earned Morrison stans all over Latin America.

After the opening piano strains of “Contigo,” we’re treated to a display of how Morrison’s lyrics can sometimes move the singer herself as she confesses to shedding a few tears during the chorus.

There is an underlying sense of purpose and release in this music as she explains why she took a break from her music career and how that influences the passion behind her latest album, El Renacimiento. 

In fact, even as she introduces “Encontrarme” as an ode to self discovery and recovery, Morrison displays where the emotion in her lyrics come from as she tears up explaining the origin of the song.

“I’m so emotional,” she says through tears, “because it’s been a long time since I’ve been touring and I took a really long time to come back to myself and to be able to sing again. Just to be here means a lot to me because I do watch NPR Tiny Desk at home!”
 
As if it couldn't get any more emotional, Morrison introduces “Te Regalo” by introducing the object of her melodic affections, her husband and co-producer, Alejandro Jiménez. 
 
I’m not saying you should have a box of tissues nearby while you watch Carla Morrison’s performance, but it came in handy for me.

wSl5_RDCfrQ,Jessie Reyez: Tiny Desk Concert,"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Latinx Heritage Month with an ""El Tiny"" takeover, featuring Jessie Reyez, Susana Baca and more musicians from all corners of Latinidad.

Anamaria Sayre | September 30, 2022
Beer cans and hair brushes may not be typical percussive tools, but typical is as irrelevant as tradition is amorphous when you're an immigrant-raised, Colombian-Canadian kid whose music is as much about navigating life on your terms as it is about holding your head up in the rip current of love.

Jessie Reyez's legendary layers — vocal dynamism, cross-genre playfulness, unapologetic realness — were on full display at her El Tiny concert. Complete with strings, horns and musical direction from Tiny Desk alum Matthew Burnett (whose credits also include Daniel Caesar's Tiny Desk), Reyez deftly danced between tracks with the assuredness of a true reina harnessing her vulnerability on stage.

Reyez opens the performance with ""MOOD,"" the starting track of her newly released second album, Yessie. Here, she uses her room-altering belting prowess to rearrange the chorus, relegating the recorded melody to the background vocals and positioning her sample of the timeless track ""Los Caminos de la Vida"" at center stage. Transitioning to a mash-up of ""MUTUAL FRIEND"" and ""FIGURES,"" she delivers a heart-shifting, string-driven performance of the two. Then, she seamlessly navigates a musician and formation change-up as she glides through the playful ""ONLY ONE"" and heartfelt mash-up of ""FOREVER"" and ""IMPORTED."" Circling back to the second half of ""MOOD,"" she easily slides into a more upbeat, cumbia-infused rendition of the soulful track. Picking up her makeshift güiro — a PBR can — she melds joy in dance and pain in song with the kind of effortless and expert execution of a woman who intimately knows in-betweenness and, better yet, understands how to bask in the beauty of its nuance.

ug25yQSEub0,Carin León: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Latinx Heritage Month with an ""El Tiny"" takeover, featuring Jessie Reyez, Susana Baca and more musicians from all corners of Latinidad.

Felix Contreras | September 19, 2022
Having played the music myself, I have always lovingly referred to Mexican Regional music as “cowboy hats and accordions.” But this is not your grandparents’ Mexican Regional. Younger musicians today are rejecting the restrictions of that industry-imposed title and adding contemporary sounds like hip-hop and trap while still maintaining the emotional spirit and rough edges of the genre.

Then there’s Carin León — a game changer if there was one. His Tiny Desk (home) concert is a deep dive into this moment in time as the genre actually changes. He starts with a traditional bolero “El Amor De Tu Vida” but the second song, “Alguien Mejor,” is an example of how he and his amazing group are changing things. It starts with a traditional bajo sexto guitar as he raps and sings the lyrics, but when the mournful strains of a pedal steel guitar popular with trad country music enters the arrangement, the cross cultural reality of life along the border where this music comes from springs to life with the passion of both genres and cultures.

It’s an exciting moment from a four song performance that beautifully represents how a culture changes and develops as outside influences become part of its aesthetic. The music’s rustic roots are on display in the barroom set, complete with strategically placed bleached-out cattle skulls. You still see accordions and cowboy hats in this video but you hear so much more — you can actually hear a society in transition.

7p78XATPcyg,Omar Apollo: Tiny Desk Concert,"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Latinx Heritage Month with an ""El Tiny"" takeover, featuring Jessie Reyez, Susana Baca and more musicians from all corners of Latinidad.

Fi O’Reilly | September 15, 2022
What a way to get our second annual El Tiny series going! Omar Apollo kicks off Latinx Heritage Month with a full-band rendition of ""En El Olvido,"" backed by Las Mariachis Lindas, as he channels a childhood spent listening to Juan Gabriel into his performance of the Mexican corrido. 

In the eternal wisdom of Alt.Latino co-host Anamaria Sayre, it's not a Mexican party until someone starts crying, and Apollo embraces esta melancolía as the band slips into the easy R&B number ""Evergreen.""  ""We're about to get more sad,"" he says to the crowd with a grin. 

Despite the heartbreak and unrequited love songs, there's a sense of ease in this Tiny Desk concert — an easy camaraderie among the group as the members sing through ""Evergreen"" and ""Petrified"" before finishing with the (slightly) more upbeat ""Endlessly.""  El corazón puede estar adolorido, but in community, the pain never seems hopeless. 

As Apollo's Tiny Desk comes to an end, he offers the audience a homework assignment for self-improvement, for putting the negative behind you and making yourself available to participate in building community: ""I want y'all to think about something,” he says. “I want you to go home, I want you to meditate and I want you to just burn the bridge."" He laughs. “I’m playing!” But as his and the band’s joyful energy attests, in the world of Omar Apollo, there’s only room for building each other up.

sN58k8tSFXg,"Alisa Amador, 2022 Tiny Desk Contest Winner: Tiny Desk Concert","Bob Boilen | May 31, 2022
It surely was a day of joyful tears. And those joyful tears for Alisa Amador, the winner of the 2022 Tiny Desk Contest, came at a time when she had been considering putting her music career on hold. For the staff of NPR and the Tiny Desk crew, it was our first Tiny Desk concert with an audience in over 800 days, and Alisa’s captivating music surely intensified our spinning emotions.

Alisa Amador opened with her Contest-winning entry “Milonga accidental,” a song about embracing your contradictions. It’s a song that our judges — iLe, Big Krit, Michelle Zauner (of Japanese Breakfast), Raveena, Nate Chinen (of member station WBGO), Tiny Desk producer Bobby Carter and I — all found to be so filled with passion. I often fall for a song because of the lyrics, and this is the first Tiny Desk Contest winner whose winning song is in Spanish. Despite the fact that I don’t speak Spanish, I felt the conflict, the yearning and the song's questioning. 

Alisa grew up in Boston, Maine, Puerto Rico and Argentina, and was raised by Rosi and Brian Amador, her Latin-folk musician parents who play in the band Sol y Canto; they were also in attendance. She’s been singing since she was four, and has been entering the Tiny Desk Contest every year since 2018. In fact, the song “Together,” which closes this concert, was an astonishing entry from 2020. For COVID safety, we limited the audience to a small group of masked NPR employees, yet the sing-along for the closing track was still powerful. 

Alisa also set her winning song to a lovely string arrangement performed by a Washington D.C. quartet and rehearsed for the first time just hours before the performance. The arrangements were originally done by Jamie Oshima after a recording session a few years back, and then Alisa’s friend Noah Fishman transcribed the arrangement. For the next three songs, she’s joined by Jamie Oshima (guitar, keys), Noah Harrington (bass) and Jacob Thompson (drums, keys).
 
“When will I know how to decipher my purpose? / When will I feel at home in my voice?” As Alisa sings those words to her winning entry in Spanish at the Tiny Desk, I’m thinking: Perhaps that moment is now.

lsg1BCISPNU,Thee Sinseers: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Felix Contreras | May 2, 2022
To appreciate the magic of a performance from Thee Sinseers, you have to understand the co-mingling of Chicano and African American communities in post-World War II, Southern California. Living in the same neighborhoods, these communities created a virtual symphony of R&B, mariachi and boleros. And what you hear in this California band's Tiny Desk (home) concert, as they perform among plants in a flower shop, builds on a legacy of music that became known as ""oldies but goodies"" in the Chicano community.

Right from the start, band leader and vocalist Joey Quiñones and his crew dig deep with their original songs that pay homage to the oldies in a way that evokes my own memories of lowrider car shows and lazy Sunday afternoons at Roeding Park in Fresno, Calif. ""What's His Name"" features a delicate falsetto that was popular in 1950s R&B. The short horn parts and the doo-wop background vocals fall into a call and response backdrop for lyrics about a broken heart.

There is a very real connection in this set between the passionate vocals of the best R&B ballads and mariachi ranchera, both borrowing from the emotional devastation of Italian opera. That's all on display in ""Hold On,"" which makes us question how we have the power to keep on living. Particular attention has to be paid to vocalist Adriana Flores' delicate pleading on ""Lovin You,"" which crescendos into a blown out ballad powered by a tight, shouted chorus from the entire band.

Anamaria Sayre | April 22, 2022
From the line up of traditional Colombian instruments to the card playing interlude, every second of Feid's Medellín, Colombia pool hall performance invokes the feeling of charlando and cantando, chatting and singing, with friends.

Seamlessly anchoring all five tracks with a bass-emulating acoustic guitar and cajón-driven dembow, the new guard reggaeton royal brings unique instrumentation and culturally significant visuals to this Tiny Desk (home) concert for a deeply authentic portrait of a star on the rise baring a sonic piece of his soul to the world.

Flexing his multi-instrumentalist background, Feid brings in a new instrument for each arrangement of his hit tracks to represent the five different regions of Colombia in a comprehensive homage to his home. He opens with su propio region, using a tiple guitar from the Andean region on ""JORDAN IV."" Moving to the Llanos, his band breaks out a harp for a beautiful rendition of ""TE MATA."" He pulls in a tambor alegre on ""VACAXIONES"" to represent cumbia from the Caribbean region. Pausing for quick brindis, taking a shot, he closes out the show with two heartfelt numbers: First, an accordion-backed, vallenato version of ""AMOR DE MI VIDA"" for the Atlantic coastal region, and then a final pivot to the Pacific coastal region he mixes in a marimba de chonta on ""SI TÚ SUPIERAS,"" before leaving the hall and riding off on a motorcycle.

The Colombian artist utilizes his full 15-minute set to depict an artistic and intentional musical image of his home and its rich sonic diversity, bringing the people, place and spirit behind a global genre center stage.

USdiumz1ZFM,The Linda Lindas: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Marissa Lorusso | April 11, 2022
A library might not be the first place that comes to mind when you picture a suitable venue for a punk band — unless, of course, you're thinking about The Linda Lindas, who shot to viral stardom after a performance in the Los Angeles Public Library's Cypress Park Branch last year. For the band's Tiny Desk (home) concert, the teen punks returned to the library — this time, playing at the Los Angeles Central Library — with several members even sporting buttons that pledge love to the LA library system. ""We're playing the library once more,"" guitarist Lucia de la Garza says with a smile, in awe of the ""cool space."" (It feels fitting — after all, having artists perform an intimate, powerful set under daytime office lights is kind of the Tiny Desk's whole thing.)

The four members of The Linda Lindas – sisters Mila de la Garza and Lucia de la Garza, their cousin Eloise Wong and their family friend Bela Salazar – first played together in 2018, as members of a new-wave cover band put together by Kristin Kontrol of Dum Dum Girls. Soon after that, they formed their own punk group, going on to open for artists like Bikini Kill, Alice Bag and Best Coast.

In the band's Tiny Desk (home) concert, each of the members — all between 11 and 17 — take turns singing, starting with ""Growing Up,"" the title track to the band's debut album, sung by guitarist Lucia. After a couple upbeat tracks sung by drummer Mila and bassist Wong about friendship and frustration, the band is joined by an additional percussionist. ""We put an advertisement in the library a few days ago,"" Lucia jokes, before introducing Spencer Lere of the band Bleached (who is also, Mila points out, her drum teacher) for a surfy track sung in Spanish by guitarist Salazar. The band ends its set with the scorching ""Racist, Sexist Boy."" Co-written by Mila and her cousin, it's the song that first caught the internet's attention with its powerfully righteous anger about a racist incident Mila experienced in the early days of the pandemic. ""Here we go — let's blow the roof off,"" Lucia says dryly just before the final song — but given how hard these four rock, you'd be forgiven for thinking she's not joking at all.

tarsyQZCMUs,Los Rivera Destino: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space. 

Felix Contreras | March 31, 2022
“Mi padre dice asustado / Que me salga de su lado / ‘Ellos son marijuanos,’” (“My father warned me / That I shouldn’t hang out with you all / ‘They are a bunch of potheads,’”) Los Rivera Destino sings in the song “Mis Amigos.” “Pero son mis hermanos / Y los quiero asi! (“That may be, but I love those potheads anyway!”)

The tongue in cheek ode to pasto (marijuana) set to the classic Latin genre bolero perfectly exemplifies how the Puerto Rican group Los Rivera Destino not only delivers impeccable musicianship and a reverential embrace of nostalgia, but also lots of humor.

All of that is on full display in its Tiny Desk (home) concert recorded in its hometown of San Juan, Puerto Rico. College friends Carlos Figueroa, Fernando Tarrazo and Antonio Sánchez started out making satirical YouTube videos about Puerto Rican politics. But as music became part of their schtick, they broke out as recording artists with a slowed-down bolero version of the reggaeton classic “Te Boté.” Next thing they knew, megastar Bad Bunny wanted to record with them.

The group’s musical trajectory now finds the three friends seated behind their “desk” for a performance that is equal parts serious and three-ring circus. Los Rivera Destino’s clever wordplay dominates the first song, “Edgar Allan Poe,” before it launches into a bolero and bossa nova-tinged live version of “Castigo.” Originally recorded with the group’s compay (close friend) Pedro Capó, it’s performed here with a four-piece band that displays the kind of musical versatility that seems commonplace in Puerto Rico. 

“Mis Amigos” is a deliriously funny ode to smoking weed. If you don’t speak Spanish, pay close attention to the translated lyrics, which do a great job interpreting both the meaning and the humor of these incredibly talented comedy writers. The last song, “Pancakes,” a loving tribute to the doughy breakfast food, wraps up this visual and lyrical treat of a performance by a group that has carved out a singular place in Latin music.

jSK5fJpqs5I,Tiny Desk Meets SXSW: KAINA,"Every year, NPR Music participates in the SXSW music festival, whether it's curating a stage or simply attending hundreds of shows at the annual event in Austin, Texas. In 2020, the festival was canceled due to the pandemic, but it returned last March as an online festival. We programmed a virtual ""stage"" of Tiny Desk (home) concerts in 2021 in a series called Tiny Desk Meets SXSW. This year we return again, virtually, with another round of Tiny Desk Meets SXSW: four videos filmed in various locations, all of them full of surprises.

Anamaria Sayre | March 22, 2022
Setting the scene with a winding tour of the jam-packed gathering of musicians in a mystical recreation of her childhood casita, Chicago-based singer KAINA offers her Tiny Desk (home) concert viewer a temporally unhinged invitation to come over to her house after school.

It doesn't take much to imagine what it was like in the vocalist's childhood home: salsa bouncing off the walls, arepas flowing from the kitchen, no one allowed to go home unfed (thanks in part to her Venezuelan and Guatemalan parents). KAINA is channeling that same casita-born energy into her performance here. She opens the performance with the title track to her new album, ""It Was a Home,"" a twinkly piece complete with nostalgic riffs and soft percussion. She mentions that she was featured in Saba's 2018 Tiny Desk, but this is her first time owning the performance herself — and she hardly takes a beat after the song is over to bask in the glory of her center-stage experience before she takes her time naming every person on stage – and off – who built the 15-minute performance. Moving on to her upbeat, zanier number, ""Apple,"" she brings more ""friends"" (instrumentalists, vocalists and puppets included) on screen for the performance. Closing with a full-bodied, chorally-backed performance of ""Casita,"" she once again takes the time to give the voices around her equal space alongside her own.

But her community – these featured musicians, the city of Chicago, Latinas across the country – aren't the only people she's elevating here. She's using this space, her casita and this moment in her career to speak to her inner child, as she describes in ""It Was a Home."" She's assuring her that when she's all grown up she'll use her voice to shine a light on her casita, beseeching the entire world to marvel at its beauty.

FlZuFh0KUvc,Camilo: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Anamaria Sayre | March 10, 2022
When catching glimpses of his meteoric rise to global stardom and his picturesque life with partner and artist Evaluna Montaner, fans are often left to speculate on the romance of Camilo’s life. From his Tiny Desk (home) Concert in Miami, the Colombian singer-songwriter pulls back the curtain for 15 minutes of soul-baring intimacy, letting the world view his fairytale life in full bloom.

Trading out his typical guitar opening for soulful strings, Camilo opens with a softer rendition of “Índigo,” a sweet dedication to his soon-to-be born baby of the same name. Setting the tone for his love-laden performance, he sings to an off-camera Montaner, Índigo’s mamá and Camilo’s querida, who trades her usual place as singer on the duet to serve as director for the performance. Transitioning to a slower “La Mitad,” his sweet vocals overlap with layers of singing guitar for a meditative rendition of the heartfelt track. When he completes the piece, Camilo pauses to recite a poem he’s written for the occasion, inviting the audience to explore the inner workings of the mind behind the music.

He transitions into a full-bodied, emotional performance of “El Mismo Aire,” complete with more silky strings and captivating percussion. Cowbell and trumpet converse playfully to create a resounding close with “Vida de Roco.” The Colombian singer-songwriter offers up a percussive bouquet for this performance, presenting each song with a novel depth of instrumentation and tone. He builds a dream landscape on layers of sweet drum solos and chest-gripping strings, inviting the listener to partake in a world where sound and heart perfectly coexist.

Born from the rich musical and historical heritage of San Basilio de Palenque, Colombia (the first free Black town in the Americas), Kombilesa Mí fuses the traditional sounds of the community with urban pop. The band's members experiment with the instruments created by their ancestors (and introduced to them when they were young) by layering them between new sounds.

Over traditional percussion, metal handmade drums of their own design, and marímbula, Kombilesa Mí rhymes and raps in Spanish and the traditional Palenquero language, a fusion of African Bantu, Portuguese, French and English. During the performance, you'll hear them call their music ""RFP,"" which means Rap Folklórico Palenquero, a combo of cumbia, son de negro, mapalé and son palenquero. --The globalFEST staff

aQcXSoamCVA,Girl Ultra: Tiny Desk Concert,"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Latinx Heritage Month with an ""El Tiny"" takeover, featuring Jessie Reyez, Susana Baca and more musicians from all corners of Latinidad.

Stefanie Fernández | Sept. 21, 2022
Girl Ultra's music is never one thing for long. After coming up in Mexico City's alt R&B scene, Mariana de Miguel built on that premise with experiments in house, bolero, pop and punk, fused with her own distinct glint. Her El Tiny performance is an effortless flash of all she is capable of and of the commanding performance she's finessed over her career. Even the onomatopoeic chorus of house track ""BOMBAY"" translates seamlessly to the desk.

Slowed and acoustic as it is, the El Tiny version of ""Punk"" captures the frenetic rush of the original, itself an alt transfiguration of Gwen Stefani's ""Bubble Pop Electric"" that interpolates its pop chorus and tailors it to the allure of going out in the south side of Mariana de Miguel's hometown of Mexico City. ""Dime tú que voy a hacer con este feeling,"" (""You tell me what I'm going to do with this feeling"") she asks, ostensibly of the person she's singing about. But it's also a question that speaks to the mutability of her performance: effusive and commanding, but never lacking a controlled restraint as it evolves. As she sings in ""DameLove,"" ""feelings always come and go.""

She begins her El Tiny performance of that song by playing a few moments of the recorded version. Cuco's voice and hers float in from the drum machine, warped, as she flutters her fingers in front of her face, cultivating mystery against the familiarity of the setting for a solo rendition of the song that feels even more intimate.

She describes the final song of her set, ""Ella Tú y Yo"" from 2019's Nuevos Aires, as ""about finding a third one in a relationship – which is pretty common these days."" Here, she reworks the R&B ballad into a simmering indie rock churn, its titular phrase whispered with a soft wince.

Just one album and an EP into her career, Girl Ultra has already commanded change — as necessary and sometimes difficult as it can be — as a driver of expression. Here, it's thrilling.

2C-WmZQABLQ,Trueno: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Latinx Heritage Month with an ""El Tiny"" takeover, featuring Jessie Reyez, Susana Baca and more musicians from all corners of Latinidad.

Vita Dadoo | September 27, 2022

With his roots in La Boca neighborhood of Buenos Aires and arms outstretched to the rest of the world, Trueno is rewriting the playbook for Latin American hip-hop. Wearing a cap for the soccer team Boca Juniors and moving among the spaces of his childhood, the 20-year-old, premier Argentinian freestyler shows us exactly where he's from in his Tiny Desk (home) concert, an intimate performance that plays like a meditation on the music and the Argentina that has shaped him.

Trueno's almost autobiographical set begins with ""DANCE CRIP,"" the first single from his recent album, BIEN O MAL, and an ode to The Sugarhill Gang's 1979 hit ""Rapper's Delight."" Trueno's affinity for old school hip-hop is something the rapper returns to throughout his set, while also invoking percussion-forward beats and tango motifs. Trueno follows up with the album's title track, before launching into an improvised freestyle. Underneath a mural that reads ""La Boca resiste y propone"" (""La Boca resists and proposes""), Trueno demonstrates his lyrical dexterity and emotional range, ""Esto no lo puede hacer cualquiera, el vocero del ghetto conquistando la esfera,"" he raps, touting his neighborhood's resilience and his own.

Argentina as a place of celebration and lament is the thematic center of Trueno's performance. The show takes place at a conventillo, one of many Argentinian boarding houses and microcosms of multicultural communities. Trueno concludes his set with ""TIERRA ZANTA,"" perhaps the most politically charged song in his album, which on record features the famous folk artist Victor Heredia. Here, Trueno calls out all the Andean nations by name, hinting at a larger global movement behind the song's boundaries.

Dy4pEFFbFsA,Mon Laferte: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Felix Contreras | January 12, 2022
It’s fair to say Mon Laferte is a musical chameleon. The Chilean vocalist’s output of late has covered a vast swath of musical styles from Latin America, from big-band mambo to electronic dance club jams with a hint of reggaeton, and a few stops in between. The secret to the successes of these stylistic changes is the level of imagination and creativity she infuses in each turn.

So, it didn’t surprise me that her contribution to our Tiny Desk (home) concert series is a visual treat as much as it is a musical one. The opening strains of “Tu Falta de Querer” introduce a cabaret-styled small orchestra and a character who appears to be left at the altar of a small intimate colonial church. She’s in torch-singer mode throughout the four-song performance; take these lyrics from the first cut: “Ahora domiré /  Muy profundamente para olvidar / Quisiera hasta la muerte, para no pensar / Me forro pa’ quitarme esta amarguara” (“Now I'll sleep very deeply to forget I would like, until death, not to think. I erase you to take away this bitterness”)

The 10-piece small orchestra is a combination of Mexican folkloric music and European chamber music, mixing the ukulele-like jarana, an oboe, a tuba, and the violins often used in mariachi. The arrangements are the perfect vehicle for Laferte’s impassioned combination of blues and ranchera vocals.

There is much to appreciate in Laferte’s celebration of the spiritual (the church setting) and the passions of everyday life (her torch singing). In fact, I can’t think of many other vocalists who would be able to pull this off with as much grace, style and artistic vision as Mon Laferte does.

S77KlsGlbCI,Edwin Perez: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"Every January, I attend globalFEST at a New York City nightclub and see some of the most fantastic music I'll experience all year. Now, given the pandemic's challenges and the hardening of international borders, NPR Music and globalFEST moved the 2021 edition from the nightclub to your screen of choice and shared the festival with the world. We called it Tiny Desk Meets globalFEST. We presented 16 artists in intimate settings (often behind desks donning globes), all hosted by African superstar Angélique Kidjo.

From the basement of the Bowery Electric in downtown Manhattan, composer and vocalist Edwin Perez and his 10-piece band come together to put on a show. With a strong backbeat and enough room to move around, Perez's up-tempo energy brings the party and keeps it going. The theme of the night is salsa dura music, which originated in New York in the 1970s and gained acclaim thanks to acts like the Fania All-Stars and Spanish Harlem Orchestra.

9-0f3bKQyAw,Lara Bello: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"April 10, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- Lara Bello occupies the space between genres where magic happens. Born in Spain, she was raised with not only Spanish traditions like flamenco and canto but also pop music and jazz. The instrumentation she assembled for her Tiny Desk reflects that elastic approach to genre: acoustic classical guitar, clarinet, violin and a percussionist who didn't keep time so much as color the proceedings.

After just three albums, Bello has become a noteworthy presence in the community of Spanish musicians who deftly mix jazz, classical and other traditions from Spain. That world can seem like a secret society to those who don't understand Spanish, but you'll see during Bello's performances that the lyrics double as another flight of exploration as they float like wisps of smoke through the sonic spaces carved out by her collaborators.

Once I heard his music, I knew I'd always look forward to whatever he produced.

Being a fan of Garza means accepting the world on his terms — and his world is filled with infinite musical possibilities. He's got a tremendous collection of musical friends who call on him for his work as a backup musician in studio sessions and on stage. For example, he and vocalist Gaby Moreno (already a Tiny Desk veteran) have been touring together lately, and you get a taste of her powerful voice as she joins Garza here.

P19YL-fy3Vk,Yva Las Vegass: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"At NPR Music, we get stacks of CDs in the mail, as well as countless links to music streams, from bands trying to stand out and get some attention. It's safe to say that we all share similar previewing procedures: At some point, we just sit and listen.

What are we listening for? I can't speak for the others, but I'm constantly in search of music I haven't heard, but which sounds as if it's been in my life forever.

That's exactly what happened when I put on Yva Las Vegass' album, I was born in a place of sunshine and the smell of ripe mangoes. I was knocked out by the way she infuses Venezuelan folk traditions with a punk aesthetic. I heard songs as allegories, songs that told stories and songs that felt like deep primal screams, all accompanied by a traditional Venezuelan cuatro — a small stringed instrument similar to a ukulele.

At the NPR Music offices, Las Vegass weaves magic with her presence, her playing and especially her voice. You can't quite see her cut-off jeans and Chuck Taylor high-top sneakers behind Bob Boilen's desk, but in attitude and style, Yva Las Vegass is punk-rock through and through.

1lc8mAiOUPA,Federico Aubele: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Argentine singer-songwriter Federico Aubele uses his dark, husky voice to produce a specific effect in the three songs he performs at this Tiny Desk Concert: Together, they jell into one impressionistic midtempo ballad.

A voice like Aubele's could be restrictive: His lower register seems to always reflect something dark and lonely. Think of your favorite bottom-scraping vocalist and the lyrics he or she interprets.

But while touches of nostalgia and longing seep into both the words and the way he sings them, Aubele can also wrangle a shy smile and a whimsical raised eyebrow with that deep, emotive voice. It's perfect for his own expressive lyrics, which he sings in both Spanish and English — sometimes in the same song. And don't even get me started on his guitar playing. --FELIX CONTRERAS

UhMRD7lw5zs,Arturo O'Farrill: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Latin jazz works best when the musicians involved are as fluent in Afro-Cuban rhythms as they are in the deep grooves and advanced harmonics of bebop. Arturo O'Farrill has that pedigree in his DNA: His father, Chico O'Farrill, was part of a groundbreaking group of musicians who created the mash-up of Afro-Cuban music and jazz back in late-'40s New York.

The octet you see in this video is a stripped-down version of the Afro Latin Jazz Orchestra, which is at least twice as large — don't think I didn't try to get the whole band behind Bob Boilen's desk — and dedicated to both preserving the legacy of the elder O'Farrill and documenting the younger musician's efforts to move the music forward.

The musicians with whom Arturo O'Farrill surrounds himself all play with intensity that draws from both traditions. It was a thrill to hear such tremendous late-night music so early in the morning — and an honor to have O'Farrill ask me to sit in with the band and share the conga chair with Tony Rosa. Playing with musicians of this caliber always steps up your game, and on this day, I did my best and had a lot of fun in the process. --FELIX CONTRERAS

BVnSJ4SL7sI,Magos Herrera and Brooklyn Rider: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"May 15, 2019 | Tom Huizenga -- When the intrepid string quartet known as Brooklyn Rider first visited the Tiny Desk nine years ago, no one knew what the musicians might play. They're as likely to trot out an Asian folk tune as they are a string quartet by Beethoven, or one of their own compositions.

For this visit though, we knew exactly what was on tap. The band, fronted by the smoky-voiced Magos Herrera and backed by percussionist Mathias Kunzli, performed three songs from the album Dreamers, a collection steeped in Latin American traditions.

The versatile Mexican singer, who has never sounded more expressive, notes that these songs emerge from struggle.

Gilberto Gil's bossa nova-inspired ""Eu vim da Bahia"" is a tribute to his home state. He released it in 1965 as Brazil's military dictatorship took charge. The atmospheric, flamenco-tinged ""La Aurora de Nueva York,"" by Vicente Amigo, sets a gritty depiction of the city by Federico García Lorca, who fell to assassins during the Spanish Civil War in 1936. And ""Balderrama,"" by the Argentine folk legend Gustavo Leguizamón, ruminates on a café which served as a safe haven for artists to talk about their work.

The music and the poetry, Herrera explained, ""transcended dark times"" for its authors. These fresh performances, imbued with both joy and pain, recall the past and point to the present.

C9fMzxICTjU,Tiny Desk Meets SXSW: Yasser Tejeda & Palotré,"Every year, NPR Music participates in the SXSW music festival, whether it's curating a stage or simply attending hundreds of shows at the annual event in Austin, Texas. Last year, the festival was canceled due to the pandemic, but it returned this March as an online festival. We programmed a 'stage' of Tiny Desk (home) concerts and presented them on the final day of the festival. Now, we present to you Tiny Desk Meets SXSW: four videos filmed in various locations, all of them full of surprises.

Felix Contreras | April 6, 2021
If only I could have experienced Yasser Tejeda and Palotré at one of the bars along Austin's Sixth Street. Tejeda, a New York-based guitarist from the Dominican Republic, started his musical career on the Dominican cuatro (a folkloric guitar-like instrument) and has incorporated guitar stylings that have made him a ""go-to guy"" for Dominican artists looking for passionate elegance in their sound.

Yasser Tejeda and his band Palotré begin their set behind a home desk with ""Amor Arrayano,"" weaving a vaguely Caribbean feel with a killer R&B hook. After a brief introduction of his bandmates Tejeda launches into ""La Culebra,"" the track that caught my attention from their album Kijombo. Palotré is a powerful groove machine behind Tejeda's virtuosic guitar playing and his playful dance moves.

Tejeda has stated one of the goals of this project is to explore the crossroads between Afro-Dominican musical traditions with anything else that pops onto their radar. Their final song here,""Nuestras Raices,"" has become one of my favorites because I hear the essence of Africa mixed with jazz and maybe a hint of heavy metal, as Tejeda steps on his distortion pedal to kick the band into overdrive with guest tenor saxophonist Mario Castro in tow.
I won't spoil the surprise, but be sure to stay until the end.

Dressed in a flowy, all-white outfit accented with a pastel checker pattern and surrounded by a matching four-piece band, the 18-year-old Portuguese singer-songwriter and rapper appears otherworldly, almost heavenly, as she harmonizes with her backing electric guitar and jumps across the room, dancing with her entire body.

Oct. 25, 2019 | Felix Contreras -- For just about fifteen minutes, the members of Rio Mira created a living and very melodic connection to Africa. Set behind a large marimba — and drums that are unique to their corner of the world — the members of the band performed music that is the legacy of enslaved people who were in both Ecuador and Colombia. Rio Mira takes its name from a river that separates Ecuador and Colombia and empties into the Pacific Ocean.

Rio Mira's three songs in this performance are dominated by the marimba and accompanied by drums from both Europe and Africa. ""La Pepa de Tangaré"" references the culinary joys of life and, like the rest of their set, celebrates life along the river: soft breezes, loving friends, the embrace of Africa and, of course, lots of festejando (partying)!

If you're a little rusty on your college Spanish classes, the extended narration in ""Román Román"" tells the tale of a village man who has healing powers and challenges death.

For me, the principal attractions to this group are the instruments and the musical skills that were handed down for generations along the river, and how they eventually ended up here on this video for you to enjoy. I dare you to not move your hips along with these infectious grooves!

eKSjxfYbxzc,Sofia Rei: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"A drum from the Argentine Pampas fuels the music of Sofia Rei in this video: The way Franco Pinna has it incorporated into a traditional drum set serves as a musical metaphor for the music Rei performs alongside Pinna and guitarist/bassist JC Maillard.

Rei carries the accent and spirit of her native Argentina in her jazz-infused vocals. She's successfully carved out a spot for herself within a small and exclusive group of vocalists from Latin America who, after spending their formative years in their own countries, came to the U.S. to blend folklore, jazz and classic influences into singing that feels both familiar and new. For about 20 minutes one sunny afternoon, the NPR Music offices were converted into a small Latin American folk club, where Rei treated us to stellar musicianship and genre-bending music.

YxUaLKJ_978,Alejandro Escovedo: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"March 20, 2019 | Felix Contreras -- When Alejandro Escovedo and his backing band known as Don Antonio set up behind the Tiny Desk, their first sounds were blistering loud. That's when we broke the news: We wouldn't amplify Alejandro's voice. We got a slightly sullen look from the band; but despite the toned-down volume, they were all still amped up.

The musician, who once opened for the Sex Pistols, obliged with a smile and seemed to appreciate the difference between being pelted with spit and debris by punk rock fans and being showered with loving appreciation in the NPR Music office.

Escovedo pulled the three-song set from The Crossing, the most recent chapter in his ongoing odyssey and a typically hard-rocking, literate saga about two teenagers looking for their American Dream of rock and roll and beat poetry.

The close quarters of the Tiny Desk allows for a kind of backstage insight into the musical and visual interplay between Escovedo and the veteran Italian band Don Antonio. Lead guitarist Antonio Gramentieri is the perfect foil for Escovedo, who adds a heavy dose of edginess to the sound with his power strumming.

Alejandro Escovedo fans are a close-knit group. We've followed his lead and have been treated to various musical aggregations over the years. But as you see in this video, this setup seems to be working just fine and may be his strongest yet.

Oct. 21, 2019 | Felix Contreras -- Something happens for me when I hear jazz mixing it up with Brazilian rhythms. In the right hands it falls into the realm of magic.

Pianist, multi-instrumentalist and composer Jovino Santos Neto certainly cast a spell over those who gathered for this joyful turn behind the Tiny Desk.

His trio rushed right out of the gate with the samba-influenced ""Pantopé"" that introduces the concept of the trio: seamless interaction between the musicians that make the band sound like one big, melodic rhythm machine.

""Sempre Sim"" starts with percussionist Jeff Busch riffing on the traditional percussion instrument called berimbau, its ethereal sound creating the perfect intro to the dreamy melody and solo from Santos Neto on piano, while bassist Tim Carey echoes the double beat on the bass drum that drives Brazilian music.

Santos Neto says Erê represents the spirits of children in the Brazilian Umbanda tradition, which makes ""festa de Erê"" an appropriate title for the intensely whimsical tune that weaves in and out of the different traditional rhythms performed by all three musicians.

Jovino Santos Neto played for many years with Hermeto Pascoal, widely considered to be Brazil's greatest living musician. Pascoal can play practically anything he lays his hands on and some of that must have rubbed off on Jovino Santos Neto. You can see it when he picks up his flute mid song, then eventually plays both piano and flute at the same time.

Like the sometimes frenetic engery of the music they play, Jovino Santos Neto and his trio are perfect examples of musicians who have so much music coming from within, sometimes one instrument is just not enough.

HdFP4P8ZkjA,Troker: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | May 19, 2017 — Mexico City is not known as one of the international jazz capitals of the world. New York, Tokyo — even Havana. But not CDMX (the new abbreviation of Ciudad de Mexico).

There is, though, a fairly rich history of jazz in the country, going back to a guy named Tino Contreras, who has been swinging since the late 1940's (sadly no longer active) through to the Toussaint brothers (Eugenio, Enrique, Fernando), who formed a way cool fusion band, Sacbe, in the late '70s. There have been others, of course, but never enough to make Mexico a place known for jazz — until now.

The young lions of Troker hail from Guadalajara, in the north of the country, but call CDMX their home now. From that home base they are making the rounds of festivals, clubs and concerts around the world, gathering fans of their smart, creative and singular brand of jazz.

As you'll see on this Tiny Desk, this is music you can dance to. In fact, when I saw them slay a post-midnight crowd at this year's SXSW, trumpeter Isaias Flores was a dancing machine, twisting and grooving to the band's mix of swing, funk, ska, psychedelic and Mexican music.

The band's compositions are journeys — as you watch them live, keep in mind that you are indeed witnessing history being made. Hopefully, Troker and others can make CDMX a jazz destination.

Jan. 10, 2020 | Felix Contreras -- There must be something in the water down in Austin, Texas, because as soon as Brownout started playing behind the Tiny Desk, it was pretty obvious that a deep musicality is just a fact of life for Austin bands.

The slow groove of the opening song, ""Somewhere To Go,"" is punctuated by an old-school R&B horn section that's deceptively simple and emblematic of the power of their concept and spirit. The intricate interplay of the baritone sax, guitar, bongos and drums launch the second cut, ""Nain,"" into another down-tempo burner, with lyrics in Spanish about being different and not fitting in and seeing that as a positive. The band closed with ""You Don't Have To Fall,"" leaning into old-school Tower of Power horns that made quite a few heads dip and hips shake in our corner of the NPR building, highlighted by guitarist Beto Martinez's solo.

One of the things you need to know about this band is that they can change traditions or genres almost on a dime. The core members dip into soul, Latin funk, a form of Peruvian cumbia called chicha, and funk covers of both Black Sabbath and Public Enemy. What each configuration has in common is the almost telepathic bond the band has developed after 15 years of working stages across the country. As you can see on the video, it's so infectious that Prince once used them for a while as a back-up band.

Like I said, there must be something in the water in Austin. Watch the video and see for yourself.

HN4Mk3LWWC4,Andrea Cruz: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"March 27, 2019 | Felix Contreras -- Andrea Cruz brought a little bit of Puerto Rico with her when she took her place behind the Tiny Desk. It was present by way of the flag she hung up on the shelves, as well as in the lyrics of the songs and the style of music she expresses herself with.

It's important to note that the instrumentation of the band that traveled with her (keyboard, two percussionists and trombone) hardly fits what you'd expect music from the island to sound like these days. But Cruz is part of a movement in Puerto Rico that emphasizes largely acoustic instruments and a folk-based approach to interpreting life before and after the hurricane of 2017. It's a bold creative statement in a land of reggaeton and salsa.

Cruz drew on songs from her first album, 2017's Tejido de Laurel. The emotion of the lyrics of the first song, ""No Toquemos Tierra,"" is evident in her angelic voice as she makes a declaration of love for the earth as a metaphor for a lover. The beauty of the song is in her poetic lyrics set to a melody that defies language.

I was very pleased to see that Cruz's live performance is very much like the stripped-down sound on her album and the handful of singles she's released. In fact, I would say her music is a perfect soundtrack to a growing, back-to-nature movement in Puerto Rico that encourages local farming and a careful stewardship of the environment. ""Santas Flores"" also digs deep into that philosophy as she sings about ""holy flowers.""

Andrea Cruz spent her time talking to the audience in a mix of English and Spanish and there was no mistaking the intense feeling behind her song about femicide on the island in the song, ""Canción de Amargura."" The sound of the entire ensemble was elevated by Cruz's plaintive vocals at the end.

Andrea Cruz is a bright new voice coming from an island with a deep history of revered vocalists and, as you can see, she more than holds her own.

zvDmr_REr5w,Buscabulla: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

It is beyond appropriate to have the two members of Buscabulla sitting inside their car at the beach in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico performing their Tiny Desk (home) concert. It's as if the bubble of being inside the car will protect them from any chances of encountering the virus on the beach. But it's also a reflection of how the band's atmospheric sonic textures get inside your head when we listen with headphones. Buscabulla set up shop in New York years ago, but returned to their home to help support the island's redevelopment — thus their entry from the beach.

Lead vocalist Raquel Berrios's voice is sultry and tinted with reverb, while her creative partner in the band, bassist Luis del Valle, has created a studio within the car that perfectly reflects the band's sound. Band members LD Valentín (keyboards) and JD Matías (timbales) make remote appearances in the lower corners of the screen.

oUGukMLPQJs,Eddie Palmieri: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"August 19, 2016 by SURAYA MOHAMED • Different Tiny Desk performers pop up in NPR Music's workspace just about every week, and frequently more often than that. While every artist is special, it's rare to have a true legend come through.

Eddie Palmieri is that once-in-a-lifetime musician, bandleader, composer and arranger. An icon for both modern and Latin jazz, he continues to break tradition and innovate within many musical styles, including salsa, fusion, Latin funk and more.

His parents were born in Puerto Rico and later moved to New York City; Eddie Palmieri was born in Spanish Harlem and grew up in the Bronx with a large family that nurtured his musical talent. He studied classical piano when he was young and gave a piano recital at Carnegie Hall when he was just 11. But all he wanted to do at that time was play the drums. When he was 13, he joined his uncle's orchestra to play timbales. He later gave up the drums and started playing piano in the early 1950s in various Latin dance bands, working with Eddie Forrester, Johnny Segui and the popular Tito Rodriguez Orchestra. You can hear his continued passion for the sticks in the percussive vamps that pervade his discography.

Recorded in 1962, Perfecta was the first of nearly 50 albums Eddie Palmieri has released. The Sun Of Latin Music, a groundbreaking album released in 1975, won him the first-ever Grammy for Best Latin Recording. He later went on to win nine more Grammys, along with a host of other prestigious honors.

It was an honor to have Eddie Palmieri perform at the Tiny Desk in a special, intimate setting — without his usual big-band accompaniment. We get close enough to hear him growl; you can check out the iconic sound he's been making since his early recordings. He's said it's his inner spirit coming out to help him play. The first composition here, ""Iraida,"" was written for his wife, who died several years ago. The second, ""The Persian Scale,"" is a rare treat — a tune you won't find on any of his recordings. The set closes with ""La Libertad,"" a statement on social justice and poverty from the classic Vamonos Pa'l Monte album, released in the early '70s. Even without the band, the audience clapped and danced as the musician played his freeform dance music, deeply rooted in beautiful yet simple chord changes and his signature Afro-Cuban rhythmic style.

n_4EMO8e-1Y,Bio Ritmo: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Latino migration in the U.S. has placed people of Afro-Caribbean heritage all over the country. Bio Ritmo's heritage leads directly back to that migration — and to the sound of Fania Records, which fueled Latin dance music's transition from the big-band mambos of the 1950s to the cutting-edge sounds of 1970s New York.

Bio Ritmo moves salsa music even further through stellar musicianship: crisp horn charts; a powerful rhythm section of timbales, congas and bongos; and a piano/bass combo that reminds me of the best groove masters in salsa and Latin jazz.

The secret to playing salsa well is a perfect combination of chops and passion that makes listeners move their hips instinctively while looking for enough clear space to break out their favorite salsa moves. This is dance music, and Bio Ritmo has burnished its reputation on dance floors. It's a time-honored tradition: If you can't make the dancers move, then you're in the wrong genre.

So move some furniture around, press play on this video, and enjoy. -- FELIX CONTRERAS

LIP7efANp0E,LADAMA: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Watch LADAMA perform ""Sin Ataduras"", ""Elo"", ""Tierra Tiembla"", and ""Inmigrante"" at the Tiny Desk.




May 30, 2019 | Felix Contreras -- During the course of their performance behind the desk, the four core members of LADAMA — Lara Klaus, Daniela Serna, Mafer Bandola and Sara Lucas — had a chance to display their individual cultural and musical roots as part of an engaging and mesmerizing whole. Represented in glorious musical virtuosity are Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela, with a dash of New York City thrown in just to make it interesting.

The video starts, for example, zeroed-in on the Venezuelan bandola llanera (or an updated version of it) while another song starts with the Brazilian pandeiro. Those instruments are put to work on rhythms from each of those countries, as well as Colombia, in songs that always percolate, even at slower tempos.

The four women in LADAMA met at a music workshop. Each are also music educators and dedicated to both celebrating and expanding the idea of cultural expression, with the help of bassist Pat Swoboda.

It's the fiery ""Inmigrante"" that finally raised the BPM meter and got hips swaying in our corner of NPR's HQ, with its call-and-response back-and-forth and a very enthusiastic audience. The band left us after the performance to travel to Brazil and record their next album. Judging from their musical spirit on display here, it can only mean great things to come.

-jWBOgn8xJQ,Making Movies: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"When Los Lobos' Steve Berlin sent me an audio file of a band he was producing, I stopped what I was doing and listened closely.

One of the joys of co-hosting Alt.Latino for the last four and half years has been the way the show has helped me discover new artists who make me feel as if I've been listening to them for years. It's going to a fun ride watching this young band grow and develop from such a strong start. Watch the video here and join us on the ground floor.

tWWxWpfkzR0,Carrie Rodriguez: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"May 27, 2016 by FELIX CONTRERAS • Carrie Rodriguez has been many things: a classically trained violinist turned American fiddler, a duet partner to veteran songwriter Chip Taylor, a successful and popular solo artist in her own right. On occasion, those roles have allowed her Mexican-American roots to bubble to the surface — perhaps in a line sung in Spanish, or through a reference to a classic mariachi song.

On her new album Lola, Rodriguez's bi-cultural life blossoms into a spectacular collection of stories and songs, several of which she included in this Tiny Desk concert with guitarist Luke Jacobs.

BDUwGCHA2b0,Camané: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Great fado singers sound as if they carry the weight of the world's sadness. They don't just wear their hearts on their sleeves — they bare their souls.

Fado, which means ""fate"" in Portuguese, emerged from the gritty barrios and docks of Lisbon in the early 19th century and has evolved in fascinating ways. Think of it as the Portuguese blues. The songs aren't just sad. They flow with an ineffable mix of longing, loss and melancholy, framed in resignation. It's a kind of glad-to-be-unhappy feeling the Portuguese and Brazilians call saudade.

Camané, with his silky baritone, can emote with the best of them, but never takes it over the top. This voice, with its volume and sheer beauty, springing from this small-framed man is something to behold.

Camané, whose full name is Carlos Manuel Moutinho Paiva dos Santos Duarte, got hooked on fado by listening to his parents' record collection. He began singing as a teenager and has emerged as a shining star of his generation, a standout male singer in a genre dominated by women. As for his success, Camané has sold six million albums in his home country. There are about 10.5 million people living in Portugal. You do the math.

One last thing: An important ingredient in fado's recipe for melancholy is the rich, tinkling sound of Portuguese guitar. It goes far beyond simple accompaniment. With its twelve steel strings strung in double courses, the instrument not only comments on the text but also enters into a type of heartfelt dialogue with the singer. Pay attention to José Manuel Neto's performance here — with nuance and charm it has the power to transport you to a cozy little tavern in the Alfama district of Lisbon. --TOM HUIZENGA

0pzIzOgIGyg,Harold López-Nussa Trio: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Dec. 14, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- Cuba is known as much for their pianists as their percussionists — you'll see why with this performance.

Cuban pianist Harold López-Nussa and his trio open their performance with some help from a recording of famed Afro-Cuban folkloric singer Lázaro Ros. Ros is both a musical and spiritual guide for this performance; the trio dug deep into the ritual music of santeria for inspiration with ""Eleguá,"" a tribute to one of the Afro-Cuban deities. (Special mention should be made of Harold's brother, Ruy López-Nussa, on drums, and bassist Gastón Joya, who both fill the spaces between the beats while elegantly leaving breathing room within the performances.)

""Preludio"" demonstrates the telepathic connection between these musicians, while subtlety and emotion are not sacrificed for the slower tempo.

""Hialeah"" has the recognizable piano riffs — called guajeos — that we can recognize as originating with Cuban dance music, but the trio deftly melds that rhythm to a complex jazz exploration, without compromising its danceable pulse.

Set List
""Elegua""
""Preludio (to José Juan)""

Dec. 20, 2019 | Felix Contreras -- It's impossible to not be drawn in by the visual specter of Balún. The band has refined their electronic roots with their turn toward self-discovery on beautifully crafted studio albums, and this set behind the Tiny Desk shows how expertly they deliver the same meticulous, artful music live.

Their mix of traditional instruments with electronics creates not just a sonic treat but also a visual feast, as our eyes dart from one instrument to the other, drawn in by a Puerto Rican cuatro and a makeshift drum set.

But I didn't expect to be greeted by a mysterious, eighth member who made an appearance at the start of ""El Espanto"" in the form of programmed solenoids that struck the bottoms of pots and pans to create a rhythmic intro to one of their brilliantly crafted songs, mixing the folkloric with the modern.

Balún is part of a vanguard of bands that is expanding the musical landscape of Puerto Rico and it is a treat to watch them up close as they create an actual bridge between the ancient and the modern, set against a rich tapestry of vocals that extoll the virtues and challenges facing their beloved island these days.

Much like an island in the ocean, this performance is just the tip of the magic this band offers. Hopefully you'll be pulled into their visual and musical attractions as much as they have for me.

4Nr7mq74gD0,Miramar: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | January 27, 2017 — Some say you have to have loved and lost to appreciate the beauty of the bolero. Since its inception in Cuba in the early 20th century, the music has been designed for thoughtful and emotional consideration of the joys and pains that come with loving someone so intensely, it becomes like a religion to adore that special someone (an actual bolero lyric).

When the members of Richmond, Virginia's Miramar first heard the music of Puerto Rican composer Sylvia Rexach, they were intrigued that she wasn't as well known as other popular bolero writers. So they came up with an album's worth of her songs to cover, and have been wowing audiences across the country with their exquisite renditions of her songs.

When they pulled into NPR to play behind Bob Boilen's desk, Miramar's members made time stop with a performance that swept us off our feet, ably backed by friends of theirs from Richmond who played gorgeous string arrangements behind the band. So turn the lights down low, clear out the living-room carpet and find your dance partner for this one.

W8SnRPbiGH8,Betsayda Machado y Parranda El Clavo: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Feb. 16, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- Watching Betsayda Machado y Parranda El Clavo perform their Tiny Desk concert is like peering back in time. The music's roots extend to the Venezuelan slave trade, and while the vocals are in Spanish and not an African dialect, the instruments the group plays date back more than 500 years.

The large bamboo cylinders, the djembe-like drums and the large friction drum together create a symphony of interlocking polyrhythms that was unlike anything I'd heard. Machado's vocals soar over the unrelenting rhythms, and when she harmonizes with the other singers, it creates a choir-like display of African call-and-response vocals.

When discussing African-influenced music from the southern hemisphere, we often focus on countries like Brazil and Cuba, places where the folk music eventually made its way into popular music. Afro-Venezuelan culture and music is rarely featured or even acknowledged outside of the country. As you'll see in this video, that should change once music fans take in the beauty of Machado's voice and the power of her historical message.

Sept. 20, 2019 | Felix Contreras -- Luz Elena Mendoza has such a far-reaching creative spirit that it's almost impossible to confine her to a single musical identity. Which is why she's one of just a handful of artists who've been invited back to the Tiny Desk to offer a revised musical vision.

When she was here last with the band Y La Bamba, it was a vocal-heavy, folk outfit. The band's sound has always been about vocals and her music has become even more so over the years.

Now she's assembled a different crew with two electric guitars and keyboards that are layered underneath her passionate vocals. And for this turn behind the desk, having played together night after night results in a musical mind-meld that is heard in how the songs seamlessly morph from one to another.

Y La Bamba's albums are meticulously crafted sonic treats with her vocals layered like a choir made with a single voice. But in our offices, she called on vocalist Isabeau Waia'u Walker to replicate their distinct sound. ""Paloma Negra"" benefits from the voices of the entire band in a high-energy mediation on rhythm and voice.

There is a bruja energy and spirit to their performance, and not in the negative connotation that is the Spanish word for ""witch."" In Luz Elena Mendoza's hands a brujeria spirit is all about conjuring the kind of magic that took place on this video.

Dec. 31, 2019 | Felix Contreras -- When the crew that is Spanglish Fly pulled in behind the Tiny Desk, the group's vibrant version of boogaloo raised the temperature in the NPR Music offices quite a bit. Whether displaying their party spirit or even the slow burn of social consciousness on the song ""Los Niños En La Frontera,"" this band plays from the heart and engages both the mind and body.

There is something absolutely infectious about combining the deep groove of an Afro Cuban tumbao bass line with a conga marcha, while the horns answer a call-and-response with the vocalists, all in a confined space. The horn ensemble work that drives ""Boogaloo Shoes"" is worthy of the song's title, a name taken from the classic dance form that drove East Coast teens crazy in the 1960s. The percussion immediately causes hips to sway.

All of this is just the tip of the iceberg that makes Spanglish Fly one of the true pioneers of the boogaloo revival scene happening on the East Coast. For about sixteen minutes, our little corner of the building was the hottest Latin dance club in D.C.

Normally backed by a band that straddles styles just as well as he does, for his turn behind Bob Boilen's desk Midón stripped it down to just voice and guitar, the musical equivalent of tightrope walking without a net.

You could choose any of the songs he performed, listen on repeat and continuously discover layers of musicality — the nuance of a bent note in his vocals, a burst of perfectly placed guitar notes.

Raul Midón has the respect of the most well-known and accomplished musicians in music, names like Stevie Wonder and George Benson. And, for a too-brief moment, we were lucky enough to hold us all enthralled, too.

iNqkT54EDBM,Aurelio Martinez: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Many tributaries follow the story of African migration to this part of the world. Much of that narrative is well-known, but little-known pockets of African culture still produce unique cultural expressions. The story of the Garifuna people is just one example.

A tapestry of cultures and influences can be heard in the guitar work of Aurelio Martinez in this Tiny Desk Concert. Accompanied by traditional Garifuna musicians and an electric guitar, Aurelio, as he is known, weaves together intricate layers of acoustic guitar to capture the polyrhythms of West African and the Caribbean. His words reflect the longing and pride for the Garifuna culture from his home along the Pacific coast of Honduras.

This is not museum music. This is living, breathing culture that is celebrated in Honduras and wherever else Afro-Latino descendants land in the so-called New World. Aurelio, his band and this music provide a fitting tribute to a nearly forgotten moment in history, keeping it alive for future generations. --  FELIX CONTRERAS

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

In celebration of National Hispanic Heritage Month, NPR Music presents four very special Tiny Desk (home) concerts recorded especially for this week.

By Felix Contreras | October 15, 2020

When we invited Brazilian vocalist Bebel Gilberto to do a Tiny Desk (home) concert, we had no idea her home would have a spectacular view of speed boats gliding across the bay in Rio de Janeiro just beneath historic Sugarloaf Mountain. But those iconic sights are in fact the perfect visual backdrop for Brazilian music, and Gilberto's in particular.

Bebel Gilberto is, of course, the daughter of one of the creators of bossa nova, João Gilberto. But as she slinks into the subtle electronic samba of ""Cliché,"" from her new album Agora, it becomes clear why she is now a standard bearer of Brazilian music. During this concert, she is accompanied by Chico Brown, the son of famed musician Carlinhos Brown and grandson of the legendary Chico Buarque.

You can feel the presence of all of that Brazilian musical royalty in one of Bebel Gilberto's most popular songs, the closing ""Aganjú.""

-jLebs9xraI,Prince Royce: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month with an ""El Tiny"" takeover of the (home) concert series, featuring J Balvin, Camila Cabello and several more musicians from all corners of Latinidad.

Anamaria Sayre | October 6, 2021
After years spent working the global stage, Prince Royce returns home to claim his rightful throne in this Tiny Desk (home) concert. Performing his entire ""El Tiny"" set live from an unassuming barbershop chair in The Bronx, the Dominican-American superstar dazzles in this homecoming performance with the unguarded swagger characteristic of a true rey de la gente.

Prince Royce instantly grips ears and hearts with a stunning performance of ""Corazón Sin Cara."" Leading with buttery vocals and easy electric guitar riffs, he serves smooth verses with the kind of suave appeal that would leave any viewer wanting to be a bachata princess. Transitioning between tracks with a sweet note about representing la cultura, he dives straight in with more traditional bachata beats in a performance of his recent release ""Carita de Inocente.""

The barbershop is where the prince discovered the building blocks to create an empire in the image of a people and culture that feel like home. In an intimate moment between songs, Prince Royce shares that it was where he would go to hear what people were listening to in the streets — bachata, merengue, mambo. His New York Dominican sound feels natural in the space.
""Porque me recuerda a mis inicios (because it reminds me of my beginnings),"" he says of his choice in stage.

From there he delivers ""Lao o Lao,"" an impassioned song about willingly giving up lavish objects for love. He closes out the show with a performance of a tropical, legacy pick ""Darte un Beso.""
Prince Royce's ""El Tiny"" concert makes it easy to imagine a curly-haired kid sitting in that same, too-big-for-him silla, dreaming of a day when the chair would fit just right and he could come back to his barrio and own the seat as royalty.

Y1Kv_sFZHqI,Yissy García & Bandancha: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"June 15, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- There is a sonic revolution happening in Cuba these days. A new generation of musicians are taking the training they received in Cuba's fabled classical music academies to new heights by incorporating not just jazz, but hip-hop, funk and any manner of experimental music. Yissy García and Bandancha may be the best example of that vanguard.

From the moment you hear the pre-recorded sound collage underneath the credits, it's a sign we're not in the Buena Vista Social Club. The compositions (all by García) are modern and reflect the cosmopolitan attitude that is common in big city life in Cuba. For example, ""Ultima Noticia"" is highlighted by the riffs thrown back and forth between drummer García and the turntablist, DJ Jigüe. The command of time and imagination García displays in her first drum solo of the set is simply astonishing.

The entire set is a lesson of contemporary Cuban music. The rapping on ""Universo"" reminded me of Cuba in the early 1990s when hip-hop entered the national consciousness as the Soviet Union left the island to fend for itself economically. On this track, it's a celebration of the universal goodness we all share.

The band winds up their time behind the desk by going back to Cuba's African roots for a rumba-soaked jam with sampled Afro-Cuban drums and rhythms. The complexity of the music meshes lockstep with passionate singing and dancing.

Yissy García and Bandancha are already Havana favorites, and I'm thrilled they're finally getting a chance to spread their music around the world. We are very fortunate that one of their stops was the Tiny Desk.

4KbPdFZ24F4,Xenia Rubinos: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"July 25, 2016 by FELIX CONTRERAS • Xenia Rubinos has learned a valuable lesson — ""You have to know where you come from to know where you're going"" — and applied it to her remarkable music. Rubinos' work contains traces of her Afro-Caribbean roots, but when she and her band do things like use two bassists to play a counter-melody in her song ""Lonely Lover,"" they defy classification.

That's what brings me to her music: the surprises, like the unexpected change-ups she brings to the way voices are presented. It all sounds heady, even heavy, but underneath it all, she and her band lay down serious grooves designed to move both your body and your intellect.

3q3z_KvLUNI,Nina Diaz: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"August 26, 2016 by FELIX CONTRERAS • When I first saw Nina Diaz back in 2010, she was fronting a punk trio from San Antonio called Girl In A Coma. She and the band sounded ferocious, with an unmistakable spirit of fun — for proof, here's their Tiny Desk concert from a couple years later.

Now, Girl In A Coma has taken a short and temporary break so Diaz could work on the inevitable solo album — and it sounds as if the break has been good for everyone all around. The other two women in the band, Diaz's sister Phannie and their compadre Jenn Alva, continue to work on a variety of side projects and recordings. (Don't sleep on their new group and album, both of which are called Fea.)

As a solo artist, Diaz finds new ways to sound ferocious, this time via songs packed with the kind of subtleties that come with a bit of age and wisdom. Her new album is due out in the fall, but she's been out on the road with her new band as they figure out how to make the new material come alive on the stage.

Judging from what we saw behind Bob Boilen's desk recently, it seems they've gotten comfortable with the music, and with Diaz's newfound status as a solo singer-songwriter.

2ZNKLUHeJtg,Renaud Garcia-Fons: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Double bassist Renaud Garcia-Fons was destined to create music that spans genres and borders: He was born in France to a family with roots in the Catalonia region of Spain, and he's fluent in French, Spanish and English. Classical, jazz and flamenco represent equal parts of his musical DNA, and his technique reflects the delicate arco stylings of concert halls, the deep groove of jazz and the raw vitality of flamenco.

This appearance behind Bob Boilen's desk captures more than just Garcia-Fons' masterful technique. His musical vision can be heard in the digital loops of rhythm and sound that he generates entirely from his upright bass. He thumps, strums and pokes as he mines the sonic possibilities of not just his bass, but also his imagination.

Garcia-Fons isn't always such a lone wolf; his collaborators include symphony orchestras, jazz groups and an amazing trio that practically defines the concept of world music. If you only knew him through one genre, you'd be surprised to discover these other sides to his skills.

For one fortunate group of NPR staffers, we had him all alone with just his bass and creativity.

gOMRNSmwa3U,Flaco Jimenez: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"by FELIX CONTRERAS

Watching Flaco Jimenez play his button accordion is like looking back in time. His grandfather started playing an accordion in cantinas and family parties along the Texas/Mexican border around the late 1800s. Then Flaco's dad, Santiago Jimenez Sr., carried on the family tradition when he released his first record in 1936.

Two of the songs you hear Flaco Jimenez play in this Tiny Desk Concert are traditional German polkas; they were popular in the mid-1800s as German immigrants settled in Texas before it became part of the U.S. almost 20 years later. Over time, the two-step stayed the same, but the German lyrics were replaced by the Mexican storytelling song form known as corridos.

But Jimenez is no dusty relic; he's very much of the here and now. For almost six decades, he's carried on those traditions and taken them to places neither his grandfather nor his father could ever imagine. He's played with The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Dr. John, Los Lobos, Willie Nelson and Ry Cooder; he's toured the world and won Grammys. He's become a symbol of ethnic pride among Mexican-Americans for not only preserving the conjunto sound, but also moving it forward.

Listen closely to this recording: I think the secret to Jimenez's longevity lies in the short bursts of improvisation in between verses he shares with bajo sexto player Max Baca, of the Grammy-winning band Los Texmaniacs. (The two have an album due out in the spring.) The notes seem to spin and strut just as the dancers do in the serious conjunto dance halls. There's a stutter here, a jazz-like riff there, and when he extends the notes and holds them playfully, I recall my own mother teaching me to spin her in a tight pirouette at family weddings and quinceñeras.

Jimenez was able to perform a Tiny Desk Concert because he had traveled to Washington, D.C., from his home in San Antonio to receive a Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment of the Arts. He was being honored for carrying on what his grandfather and so many other conjunto musicians have been doing for more than a century: getting people on the dance floor with an accordion and a song.

FdBwOOwcwTU,Danilo Brito: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Tom Cole | May 12, 2017 — After four chords, the notes start to fly — Danilo Brito and his four collaborators, three Brazilians and one American, are off like jackrabbits in front of a hound, having hustled their instruments to the Tiny Desk at the end of a North American tour.

Brito a 32-year-old mandolin player, made his first record when he was a teenager, plays a type of music called choro (pronounced ""shore-oo"").

It's said that choro started in the streets and back yards and made its way to the concert hall. Brazilian musicians of all genres have drawn on choro, from popular composer Antonio Carlos Jobim to Heitor Villa Lobos, one of the giants of Latin American classical music. Its literal translation from the Portuguese is ""to cry,"" but in Brito's dextrous hands a better translation may be ""crying out to be heard.""

You can hear Brito and his colleagues play their arrangement of Villa Lobos' ""Melodia Sentimental,"" originally written for voice and orchestra, behind the Tiny Desk, but what you're actually hearing is a kind of formal Rodas de Choro, the circles of players who developed this music more than a century ago and have carried it on to the present.

Only — in the backyards, they don't wear suits and ties.

The virtual celebration, hosted by Jorge ""Gitoo"" Wright, highlighted outstanding talent in Afro-Latin and Afro-Caribbean music across the globe. Our showcase featured four artists who honored their homes and celebrated the art their heritage has inspired.

LaTesha Harris | May 2, 2021
""I feel that we are living in a crazy moment in a crazy time and music has been a safe place for me — the only safe place for me,"" Luedji Luna says in a low, alluring voice as she explains the purpose of her latest album, Bom Mesmo É Estar Debaixo D'Água. The album, much like the Brazillian singer-songwriters's Tiny Desk performance, is a respite from these times. Elements of jazz and blues are infused with African rhythms as Luna uses music to express her ongoing struggles for autonomy as a Black woman. She performs from her coastal hometown of Bahia in the city of Salvador, Brazil, where African culture flows in abundance. Luna is a powerhouse, entrancing and elegant, soulful and spiritual, as she uses her platform to discuss individual and systemic forms of anti-Blackness.

tKTQAGYo5hE,Daymé Arocena: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"May 12, 2016 by FELIX CONTRERAS

As the U.S. and Cuba normalize relations politically, the musical effects of the thaw are already being felt. Singer Daymé Arocena invokes the orishas as she and bandmates Rafael Aldama and Jorge Luis Lagarza Perez set out to draw connections between the music of the two countries. Arocena's voice is a deft combination of Aretha Franklin's soul and the sabor of Cuban music queen Celia Cruz.

As you'll see in the video, Arocena's performances are fueled by her surprisingly mature songwriting (she's only 24), as well as an irrepressible personality that projects warmth and fun, not to mention a million-watt smile. The level of musicianship on display here provides an extraordinary window into the talent waiting to be discovered in Cuba. It's fun to imagine what other joys await.

ZoxKkGpRbtk,Cande y Paulo: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Felix Contreras | May 5, 2021
I'm a little envious of those of you about to press play on this Tiny Desk (home) concert. The first time I heard this Argentine duo was love at first sight.

Vocalist and upright bassist Cande Buasso and keyboardist Paulo Carrizo are from San Juan, Argentina, a very small town nestled by the Andes close to Chile. I like to imagine that the secluded location contributes to the magic and nuance of the very personal musical language the two have developed since forming the duo in 2017.

Things kick off with the magic turned up to 11 with Leonard Cohen's ""Treaty,"" from 2016's You Want It Darker. The duo's introduction to the world was a heartbreaking YouTube performance of ""Barro Tal Vez"" by the Argentine rocker and songwriter Luis Alberto Spinetta, and their performance of it here is no less haunting and captivating.

""Limite En Tu Amor,"" a cover of Feist's ""Limit To Your Love,"" is a preview of one of the tracks that will be included on their upcoming album of covers, produced by Grammy-winning producer Larry Klein. And they seal the deal with ""Tuyo,"" a nod to one of the most unheralded singer-songwriters in Latin America, Rodrigo Amarante of Brazil. Tuyo translates to ""yours"" and it's a fitting close to the briefest of introductions, but one strong enough to make Cande y Paulo one of our favorite discoveries of 2021.

RJMQkye_YTw,Omar Sosa & Paolo Fresu: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"You don't really listen to an Omar Sosa concert so much as experience it. The Cuban-born pianist's overall demeanor exudes a sense of calm and deep reflection, while a spiritual connection to music and his ancestors comes through in his piano playing.

You can hear Sosa draw on more than 100 years of Cuban piano in the recognizable rhythms of his country's music. But in Sosa's hands, it's not all fiery and bombastic; he's most effective when he uses Afro-Cuban tradition as a guide to his distinct, subtle and nuanced approach.

In Paolo Fresu, Sosa has found a sympathetic musical partner. Fresu's work on trumpet and flugelhorn provides a perfect foil for Sosa's introspective intersection of jazz, Afro-Cuban sounds and a chamber-music mentality.

Sosa and Fresu's quietly energetic performance behind Bob Boilen's desk enveloped everyone in attendance like a soft mist. Fresu's use of digital delay never clashed with Sosa' acoustic piano, instead adding another color to the palette; at times, Fresu uses it to add a layer of rhythm with either the ring on his finger or a blowing technique into his horn.

Omar Sosa and Paolo Fresu were as much fun to watch as they were to hear. Watch this Tiny Desk Concert and see for yourself. --FELIX CONTRERAS

The virtual celebration, hosted by Jorge ""Gitoo"" Wright, highlighted outstanding talent in Afro-Latin and Afro-Caribbean music across the globe. Our showcase featured four artists who honored their homes and celebrated the art their heritage has inspired.

LaTesha Harris | May 3, 2021
From her hometown of San Juan, Puerto Rico, Calma Carmona delivers a bewitching Tiny Desk performance. Her voice rarely rises above a whisper as she sings over impassioned Afrobeats during her three-song set — but when it does, it's a gritty, intimidating growl. Carmona got her start in 2013 when the Latin soul singer-songwriter released her first EP and opened for Beyoncé's The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour in Puerto Rico.

he-eAyHRfFg,Juana Molina: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"No one else makes music that sounds like this. Juana Molina takes familiar elements — guitars, drums, keyboards, voice — and manipulates them into bewildering, attractive, polished jewels. Her songs don't fall into beat patterns we're used to, but we can dance to them. The guitar doesn't make sounds you'd expect, but we can relate to them. It's as if she'd been raised by wolves and discovered the world of music on her own.

The truth, however, is that Juana Molina is a creative soul. A comedian in her home of Buenos Aires, she found success in that field before giving it all up for music at age 23. Now 51, with six imaginative records in her catalog, Molina brings her small band to share some magic at the Tiny Desk. This is one of the most enchanting 15 minutes of music I've heard all year.--BOB BOILEN

p0x3aKmEu7M,Helado Negro: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Helado Negro | June 30, 2017 — The artist Helado Negro (Roberto Lange) made a very big impression on me when I first experienced him almost eight years ago. It was a sound I had never quite heard, and I was immediately drawn in; there were layers of synths, percussion that percolated rather than pulsed, vocals that epitomized the world ethereal and lyrics in Spanish and English that floated amidst the music like wisps of smoke.

I caught his live show in Mexico City and in Austin, Texas and each time the spectacle of theater and elaborate presentation were just as important as the music (including two dancers covered in what can best be described as Christmas tree tinsel).

But that's not what you're getting here — instead of tinsel, we get Roberto standing behind Bob Boilen's desk in a t-shirt that says ""Young, Latin and Proud,"" the title of his most recent single. That's the essence of the songs he chose to play (and really, his entire catalog), music about being a young American with Ecuadorian parents, singing about life in here in the U.S.

Our little concert here also shows off an acoustic treatment of Helado Negro's vision, and it's just as compelling without the electronics. In fact, it's as if the songs reveal a different aspect of themselves, the lyrics intimate and laid bare. Personally, I loved the sound of the alto and tenor saxophones playing harmonies in place of a bank of keyboards. As you'll see, the entire band perfected that delicate balance of intensity and low volume, letting the music and ideas breathe.

This performance was a long time in the making, but the payoff is clear, presenting an artist in full command of his craft.

Dec. 18, 2019 | Felix Contreras -- When Los Lobos gathered behind the Tiny Desk, it felt like they were cramped in the back room of a family Christmas party. ""The only thing missing today are the tamales!,"" I told my office mates while introducing the band, a reference to a Mexican-American Christmas meal staple. The vibe in the room was definitely familia, with the presence of many long-time fans as well as folks who came for the holiday cheer, Lobos style.

The band called up tunes from the Latin Holiday song book, straight from their recently released, first-ever Christmas album, Llegó Navidad, a bilingual collection of songs from across Latin America and the U.S.

They kicked it off with an obscure novelty hit that was once popular in Latino households in the southwest, ""¿Dónde Está Santa Claus?."" It was originally a lushly orchestrated affair that is now a ""lowrider oldie.""

The new album's title cut, ""Llegó Navidad,"" is actually a classic from the Fania Records catalog originally performed by the Puerto Rican composer and singer Ismael Rivera. Los Lobos retains its pan Latin callout to holiday celebrations across Latin America, set to a slow burning montuno groove.

The band adds a David Hidalgo and Louie Perez original to the Latin holiday songbook with ""Christmas and You,"" a plaintive ballad about desperate loss that we would easily call a carte vena (vein cutter). The great Mexican essayist Alma Guillermoprieto once wrote that it's not a real Mexican party ""until someone cries"" and this song does the trick.

The party ends by sending everyone home, dancing with ""It's Christmas Time In Texas,"" a song by the great Tex- Mex troubadour, Freddy Fender. It's a Los Lobos scorcher, complete with accordion and good times that would get even abuelita dancing.

B6DLS5tahlM,Raquel Sofia: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Singer Raquel Sofia has spent most of her career 20 feet from stardom as a backup singer for Juanes and Shakira. But these days, she's got her own new album and tour, leading a small band of gifted musicians. Sofia's songs are about matters of the heart — and, as you'll hear in her performance here, it's hard to believe that feeling bad can sound this good. Her music doesn't wallow; instead, it makes me want to celebrate and experience the joy and pain along with her.

I hope you find a place in Raquel Sofia's music for yourself. Her voice, her songwriting and her performances more than met the expectations I had after hearing her EPs, so I don't doubt that you'll become a fan, too. --FELIX CONTRERAS",2021-11-15 16:41:52,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6DLS5tahlM,ELTINY,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B6DLS5tahlM/default.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B6DLS5tahlM/mqdefault.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B6DLS5tahlM/hqdefault.jpg,NPR Music,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A

0SNhAKyXtC8,Edmar Castaneda: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Edmar Castaneda is the sort of musician who isn't afraid to challenge the established order. He's carving out a place for himself in Latin jazz on an instrument you don't often hear in his chosen genre: the Colombian harp. He's adapted intricate traditional fingerpicking techniques to play jazz melodies along with the Afro-Cuban tumbao (bass line). As you can see and hear for yourself in this Tiny Desk Concert, he can switch between rural Colombian dance music and jazz with a twist of his wrist. Literally.

His musical vision is so invigorating that he's gaining fans like NEA Jazz Master Paquito D'Rivera, with whom Castaneda has performed. His Web site shows him constantly on the road as a guest artist with other forward thinkers, or with his latest touring trio, which consists of Castaneda, a drummer and a trombonist.

Castaneda recently parked himself behind Bob Boilen's desk and crafted a transporting mix of tradition and improvisation.

Aug. 2, 2019 | Felix Contreras -- When vocalist Ileana Cabra Joglar and her band visited the Tiny Desk, they'd just arrived from the front lines of the historic demonstrations taking place in Puerto Rico. Two days earlier, they were part of a crowd of tens of thousands who were on the streets calling for the resignation of embattled Gov. Ricardo Rosselló. (Rosselló recently stepped down, effective Friday.)

Right from the start, it was clear what was on iLe's mind in her song ""Curandera"" — ""I am a healer / I don't need candles to illuminate / I bring purifying water to cleanse / Removing pains so they never return"" — as congas and percussion shook the room with an Afro-Caribbean beat. The song is from the Calle 13 veteran's most recent album Almadura, which is filled with metaphors and allegories about the political, social and economic conditions in Puerto Rico. If there were any doubt as to her meaning, it was dispelled as she and the band transformed the passion and revolutionary spirit of the massive street demonstrations into a performance unlike many heard in our offices.

In the chorus of the slow-burning ""Contra Todo,"" iLe sings about channeling inner strengths and frustrations to win battles and remake the world. Her lyrics are rich with history, capturing the spirit of the streets of San Juan even as she stood, eyes closed, behind the Tiny Desk. Her entire performance is a startling reflection of this moment in Puerto Rican history.

By the time iLe and her band launched into ""Sin Masticar,"" they'd already captured the full power of protest, as their musical arrangements raged with the intensity of a crowd joined by a shared cause and pulse.

qOxCOMtJbC8,Alfredo Rodríguez Trio: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Oct. 18, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- Cuban pianist Alfredo Rodríguez gave our office audience a very quick lesson on why pianists from that island nation are so impressive: they treat the piano as the percussion instrument it is. Rodríguez immediately let fly with an intense flurry of notes that were as melodic as they were rhythmic.

The mash up of European lyricism and Afro-Cuban percussion is at the heart of the Cuban piano tradition and it is very present in the first song. It wasn't long before Rodríguez dug deep into rapid-fire syncopation along with drummer Michael Olivera and guitarist/ bassist Munir Hossn.

Iconic music producer/composer Quincy Jones heard Rodríguez during a performance at a European jazz festival and took him under this wing, eventually signing him to Jones' management company. When you listen to the expansive and lyrical exploration of the second song in this Tiny Desk set, ""Bloom,"" it's easy to hear what captured Jones' attention.

The West Africa-based Yoruba spiritual tradition, commonly known as Santeria, infuses so much of Cuban daily life in music and Rodríguez closes with his take on the music dedicated to the Orisha Yemaya, the goddess of the ocean and all waters. The song's melody is a derivation of the song associated to Yemaya and the Tiny Desk trio explores the rhythms of the melody, up to and including the sing-along at the end.

Every exposure to Cuban music presents an opportunity to walk alongside historical music figures and Santeria spirits alike. This performance is no exception. Watching these three performances repeatedly reveals new musical turns that slowly reveal how Alfredo Rodríguez is making a name for himself, alongside two incredibly talented, like-minded band mates.

mkYN0mzY_2E,Tiny Desk Meets AFROPUNK: ChocQuibTown,"LaTesha Harris | April 25, 2021
Tiny Desk Meets AFROPUNK is the electrifying kick-off to AFROPUNK's ""Black Spring"" festival. The virtual celebration, hosted by Jorge ""Gitoo"" Wright, features performances from ChocQuibTown, Calma Carmona, Luedji Luna and Nenny. AFROPUNK, born out of a 2003 short film by the same name, is an international movement and music festival centered on Black exploration and rebellion. Starting as a way to create space for the unacknowledged presence and influence of Black culture in a predominantly white punk scene, AFROPUNK has since evolved into a distinct, multi-genre experience.
""Black Spring"" was created to spotlight outstanding talent in Afro-Latine and Afro-Caribbean music across the globe. The Tiny Desk Meets AFROPUNK program aims for the same. The showcase's four artists have come to the Tiny Desk to honor their homes and celebrate the art their heritage has inspired. Learn more about them below.

ChocQuibTown
""¡Tú sabes!"" Carlos ""Tostao"" Valencia exclaims after Colombian hip-hop trio ChocQuibTown performs its first song, the energetic ""Somos Pacífico."" ""ChocQuibTown, straight from Colombia, from the Pacific coast,"" he says. ""We call it Africa inside Colombia, we got the flavor, we got the flow."" ChocQuibTown — named after the coastal area the trio hails from — is a family affair comprised of siblings Miguel ""Slow"" Martinez and Gloria ""Goyo"" Martinez, the latter of which is married to Valencia. In 2000, the trio formed to promote their neglected corner of Colombia's culture; today, ChocoQuibTown's music blends the traditionality of Afro-Latin jazz with the modernity of hip-hop to create a singular, yet versatile sound.

April 15, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- Angelica Garcia decorated the Tiny Desk with colorful fabrics, orange flowers, a fuchsia dress, and a great deal of pride in what she calls her ""Salva-Mex-American"" heritage. Her song ""Orange Flower"" got my attention back in 2016, but I thought of her only as a Virginia rock and roller. Not anymore. Angelica Garcia's music in the 2020s embraces her heritage, her life growing up in Los Angeles, and the ranchero music she heard from her family. Angelica moved to Virginia at age seventeen. The songs she sings at the Tiny Desk, all from her album Cha Cha Palace, reflect the way she was seen, or more to the point, not seen, in her new home. ""Jícama"" captures that feeling of invisibility:

""I see you, but you don't see me
Jícama, jícama, guava tree
I been trying to tell ya but you just don't see
Like you, I was born in this country.""

On the opening song, ""Guadalupe,"" Angelica expresses respect for La Virgen de Guadalupe, the patron saint of Mexico, singing ""I wanna be like her."" Guadalupe inspires her to declare that ""power isn't defined by your physique."" In this Tiny Desk concert, Angelica, along with her Richmond bandmates, powerfully convey the all-important message that we are all part of this country's colorful fabric, and we all deserve to be heard.

Watch Los Lobos’ Tiny Desk concert from 2010: https://www.npr.org/2010/11/10/130810052/los-lobos-tiny-desk-concert

Felix Contreras | November 10, 2010

Los Lobos has proven time and again that a universal shared experience will always trump culture and language. The group writes music that speaks to all of us as individuals, yet can make us feel connected when we pack ourselves into a club to watch them perform.

I've been a fan of Los Lobos since I was 18 and the band was playing mariachi music on the campus of UC-Davis. I'm 52 now. I've seen many, many Los Lobos shows and even interviewed the band a handful of times, and yet I still get excited when I get a chance to see its members play.

This past summer, the group released a new album called Tin Can Trust. Thankfully, for Los Lobos, there's always a new record: songs to sing along to, stories to compare our lives to, cumbias to dance to. This short blast from behind Bob Boilen's desk has something new, something old and something to dance to. So pull the chairs back and grab a partner — it's time to dance.

jdHPotMqv1M,Sech: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month with an ""El Tiny"" takeover of the (home) concert series, featuring J Balvin, Camila Cabello and several more musicians from all corners of Latinidad.

Stefanie Fernández | October 4, 2021 
The first florid trills of piano wash in, and Sech is here to celebrate reggaetón in its home. The scene: the light-soaked Biblioteca de la Autoridad del Canal de Panamá Roberto F. Chiari.
Sech arrives with a book he places on the table. His blazer bears his name, the isthmus of Panama and its flag, and the likeness of Panamanian Yankee great Mariano Rivera and his jersey number, 42 (the namesake of Sech's most recent album). He approaches the mic for a silky version of ""Playa"" that, like the rest of his Tiny Desk set, is nearly entirely acoustic.

Sech's discography is itself a place of learning for the Latin pop industry he has reinvigorated. The history of reggaetón often dwells disproportionately on Puerto Rico in the 1990s, overshadowing its creation by Black Panamanians in the 1980s with plena and reggae en español, born from Jamaican reggae and dancehall and iterated in Río Abajo, Sech's hometown in Panama City. ""Otro Trago"" introduced Sech's honeyed, melodic vocal range as a promising young player in an industry enamored with its own reductive powers. In Sech's hands, reggaetón is given the care of a people's history.

Music fills every corner of the library, from the violin-DJ-bass trio nested in the second-floor balcony, to the background vocals, keys and drums (anchoring the whole thing in lush, acoustic dembow), to Sech and his guitarist and producer Jhon el Divertido in the forefront. The sterile fluorescents among the stacks shift to disco lighting for the bitter ex-text ""911,"" which eventually melts into an a cappella chorus. It ends on a melancholy violin riff that blooms seamlessly into the jazzy opening of ""Sal y Perrea."" Sech might be singing about stalking an ex's social media or pointing a newly single woman toward tequila to forget some payaso, but his modern textbook feels timeless in this hybrid arrangement, showing — as well as telling — the story of dembow and its power to heal.

S52_XxBwbJg,Silvana Estrada: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month with an ""El Tiny"" takeover of the (home) concert series, featuring J Balvin, Camila Cabello and several more musicians from all corners of Latinidad.

Anamaria Sayre | September 27, 2021
Silvana Estrada's angelic first note strikes, and for a moment her family's instrument workshop in Veracruz, Mexico, feels like a window to the heavens themselves.

Adorned in a white dress and a radiant smile, the singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist invites us to participate in a rich and varied expression of familial love and musical brilliance. She wastes no time entrancing her audience, using a stripped-down performance of ""Un Día Cualquiera"" — accompanied by nothing but soft claps and subtle harmonies — to showcase her impeccable vocal precision and range.

After a sweet ""Bienvenidos,"" Estrada picks up the Venezuelan cuatro — her most beloved magic-making tool — and jumps into a sublimely arranged, effortlessly enchanting rendition of ""Tristeza."" Then, halfway through ""Te Guardo,"" something extraordinary happens: the sound of stringed instruments comes out of nowhere, and as Estrada steps away from her microphone, the camera follows, exposing a string quartet set up just off screen. After that moving reveal, Estrada takes a seat and begins to perform ""Marchita,"" where strings, cuatro, and voice marry in indiscernible harmony.

Shifting scenes once again, Estrada moves outside and we meet her papa, armed with a double bass. Father and daughter conjure a musical manifestation of pure love with a stunning performance of ""Tonada De Ordeño [El Ordeñador]."" Though the traditional Venezuelan tune is a longtime favorite, this performance is different. A butterfly takes a seat on Silvana's mic and the camera zooms out to reveal the other instrumentalists in the workshop looking on in knowing admiration. Silvana's voice reverberates across the Veracruz hillside and the world exhales, basking in a fleeting moment of divinity on earth.

4J5zTLnIqMY,Diamante Eléctrico: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month with an ""El Tiny"" takeover of the (home) concert series, featuring J Balvin, Camila Cabello and several more musicians from all corners of Latinidad. 

Reanna Cruz | September 17, 2021
Six hands, holding pencils as drumsticks, tap out a simple percussive beat on a Wurlitzer and two desks. Zooming out, the camera reveals the members of Diamante Eléctrico, accompanied by a colorful 10-piece backing ensemble in their home country's capital, Bogotá.

Diamante Eléctrico's brand of Colombian indie rock can be described in three words: funky, inventive and necessary. The Latin Grammy-winning band's music emphasizes community and place — two things that are displayed front and center as the band takes the stage in the second ""El Tiny"" performance of Hispanic Heritage Month.

""NO MIEDO!!!"" (no fear) and ""VERDAD"" (truth) adorn the worn-down desks as the collective powers through a politically-charged four-song set. Opening with 2018's ""Rotos,"" they breathe champeta life into their songs through horns and instruments like the guacharaca, played by singer Juan Galeano's brother Mario. They follow with ""Suéltame Bogotá,"" an upbeat plea to escape a suffocating home, and feature a spirited guest performance by Nicolai Fella of LosPetitFellas. ""Amalia"" leads into a genuine expression of thanks and solidarity, as Galeano gives gratitude to those protesting on ""primeras línea y segunda línea,"" shouting out the students and farmers challenging the government before finishing the set with ""A Veces.""

It's why Diamante Eléctrico has made themselves so crucial, not only in the Latin indie rock scene, but in music at large: the band's tether to its home country is substantial, no matter how fraught it may seem. Through both its music and stage presence, Diamante Eléctrico curates a shared sense of Latin roots and family, expanding outward from its home of Colombia and resonating across Latinidad, from Puerto Rico to Panama.

fJNSgPqQ1yw,Eme Alfonso: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month with an ""El Tiny"" takeover of the (home) concert series, featuring J Balvin, Camila Cabello and several more musicians from all corners of Latinidad.

Felix Contreras | September 29, 2021
As you gaze into the space where Cuban vocalist Eme Alfonso performs her Tiny Desk (home) concert, you enter a place where music becomes a spiritual language. So much of her history and music is centered around the Afro-Cuban spiritual practice that some know as santería. In the 1980s, her parents started Síntesis, a pioneering band that performed secular versions of that musical liturgy through electric jazz fusion. In fact, her parents, Carlos Alfonso and Ele Valdés, join her on vocals on this three-song set, which she recorded in Havana.

As with all things spiritual, it's best to start off paying homage to all things greater, which she does with a track from her 2018 album Voy, ""Ayabba,"" a prayer sung in Yoruba and interpreted for voice and jazz trio (in this case, bassist Julio César González, pianist Jorge Aragón and drummer Oliver Valdés).

""Libre"" showcases the historic musical ties between the US and Cuba, as Alfonso's vocals reflect her love for soul and jazz. Jazz is also part of that long-standing cultural give and take, as evidenced by Aragón's masterful piano solo.

""El Bote"" features the preternatural family vocal connection between Alfonso and her parents. In an interview I did with her dad Carlos Alfonso, he told me the main inspiration for the choir-like vocals of their group Sintesis were inspired by Freddie Mercury and Queen. There is a bit of those stacked harmonies in the chorus, before a propulsive drum solo by Oliver Valdés that propels the song to a dramatic close.

Eme Alfonso is representative of the kind of music that defies expectations of what Cuban music should sound like. This stop in Havana during our ""El Tiny"" tour of Latin music is just the tip of the iceberg of the musical riches of contemporary Cuba.

Anamaria Sayre | September 22, 2021
maye's sultry vocals and ethereal energy conjure a world in which areperias shrouded in hazy bubbles and twinkly lights feels astonishingly normal.

The enchanting pop singer fills her ""El Tiny"" home stage — the artist's favorite Venezuelan eatery in Miami — with family and friends, su propia gente. She opens with a short and simple rendition of the soon-to-be-released ""Maybe Baby"" before dropping her instrument and transitioning to an up-tempo, vocal-driven performance of ""Yours."" Picking the electric guitar back up, she strums along with a steady percussion and accompanying guitars for a soulful premiere of brand-new track ""Descifrar,"" emanating an understated and consistent confidence fitting for a pop reina on the rise. She closes out the set with a full-bodied execution of ""Tú,"" showcasing her signature tropicalia-meets-dream pop sound.

maye's effortless sashay from English to Spanish in her songs and speech represent an important facet of the El Tiny audience. Featuring a whole crew of Venezuelan-Americans, including her famous Latin singer-songwriter papá, Fernando Osorio on the traditional Venezuelan cuatro, the third performance in our Hispanic Heritage Month series authentically represents the experience of a family like maye's — one that exists in both planes, two worlds.

Given a moment and a platform like this, maye seizes the opportunity and creates an alternate universe, where barriers of culture and language dissolve and areperias sparkle.

h_a5zbizXCw,YEИDRY: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month with an ""El Tiny"" takeover of the (home) concert series, featuring J Balvin, Camila Cabello and several more musicians from all corners of Latinidad.

Stefanie Hernández | October 8, 2021
For a moment, it looks like YEИDRY is rising from the sea. She's barefoot and wearing yellow, like the roses on her side table tiny desk, Oshún's color. On the floor, below the seaside view, is a box of records displaying Celia & Johnny, the 1974 classic collaboration between Celia Cruz and Johnny Pacheco. To her right sits the 1979 album Cross Over by the Fania All Stars, of which Celia and Johnny were both starring members. From Soho Beach House in Miami, YEИDRY performs five songs, which make up most of her solo discography.

She opens with a song that's just as intimate as her space. ""Nena"" is a prayer sung from the perspective of her mother when she went to Italy in search of opportunity, while a young Yendry Fiorentino stayed with her grandmother in her hometown of Santo Domingo. After she turned 4, she joined her mother in Turin, where she grew up and started her music career.

YEИDRY's songs radiate with a feminine strength of many lives lived, from the sobered reflection on a past relationship of ""Se Acabó"" to the self-sure ""Ya,"" a song ""about the fire ... and the courage that all of us have inside. And sometimes we struggle to get it out."" Its first phrase, ""yo quiero to'"" (""I want it all""), is an invocation of remembering who you are. In ""You,"" her collaboration with Damian Marley, she inhabits the voices of both lovers with a seamless confidence. And in her closer, ""El Diablo,"" she adopts even the devil's power with a slow-burning flamenco that ignites into merengue as she repeats ""soy Dominicana / soy Italiana,"" honoring all her selves in the afternoon light.

coMyNfnNBs4,J Balvin: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month with an ""El Tiny"" takeover of the (home) concert series, featuring J Balvin, Camila Cabello and several more musicians from all corners of Latinidad. 

Reanna Cruz | September 16, 2021
A tattooed hand scrawls on a small school desk — ""Jose by J Balvin"" — followed by a signature smile. It's an intimate beginning for the príncipe del reggaetón, J Balvin himself, as he begins his ""El Tiny"" performance on a sunny barge in the middle of the East River. Backed by the Brooklyn Bridge, Balvin breezes through some of the best cuts off of his new album JOSE (Balvin's birth name). The first three — ""Vestido,"" ""Que Locura"" and ""OTRO FILI"" — are moody and gentle popetón, creating expectations of familiar intimacy before he blows the performance wide open with the Tainy-produced, tempo-shifting album opener, ""F40."" And as the sun descends on the New York skyline, Balvin closes it out with a drop-laden extended mix of the jock-jam Skrillex collaboration, ""In Da Getto.""

To talk about modern Latin music is to talk about J Balvin. Over the course of the past 10 years, ""the boy from Medellín"" has risen from humble beginnings in Colombia to global superstardom, building an unprecedented fanbase at the intersection of pop, reggaetón, house and hip-hop, with over 18 billion views and 35 million record sales to prove it. He is the first Latino to headline Coachella and Lollapalooza, and there isn't a more fitting artist to kick off our month of ""El Tiny"" performances — Balvin is the epitome of cross-cultural success.

When a drone flies out during the last drop of ""In Da Getto,"" and we finally see the true scope of the barge that Balvin has been performing on, it serves as a reminder that no matter how personal his songs may be, Balvin will always, always, be massive.

Q6s_ZL8b3GE,ÌFÉ: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"April 27, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- 
When I first heard ÌFÉ I was stopped in my tracks. Literally. I pulled the car over and just listened.

I recognized Afro-Cuban drumming and chanting, but it was coming at me with electronic furnishings that made their drums and vocals sound like a futuristic spiritual ceremony.

ÌFÉ is from Puerto Rico and feature a surprising back story. The group's debut album, IIII+IIII, is a fresh electronic take on tradition that's winning over even the most devout practitioners of the western African-based spiritual ceremonies that form the base of their music. That's hard to do with ritual music.

For their turn behind the Tiny Desk, Otura Mun and his ensemble unplug their drums for their first tune, an acoustic version of their ""House of Love (Ogbe Yekun)"". The sound of the second song here is what startled me when I heard the band's debut CD last year: the parts normally performed on Afro-Cuban bata drums and chekeres are electronically treated for a traditional prayer for the deity Oduduwa. By the last tune, ""Bangah (Pico Y Palo),"" the electronics have created a sonic playground that plays perfectly against the battery of Afro-Cuban rhythms.

Listen for the explainer during the performance by Otura Mun, who also gives a shout out to those struggling against the vestiges of colonialism still prevalent in Puerto Rico.

Feb. 28, 2020 | Felix Contreras -- When I presented Cimafunk at the Alt.Latino SXSW showcase last year, it was easily one of the most dynamic performances I had seen in more than ten years of attending the annual music festival. I couldn't wait to get them behind the Tiny Desk so the band could strut its intoxicating mix of Afro-Cuban dance music and 1970s funk-and-soul from the US.

From the moment Cimafunk and his band start their feathery intro to ""Alabao,"" it's clear that something different is about to go down. Lead vocalist Cimafunk (Erik Rodríguez) has mastered the mash-up of Cuban soneos (vocal improvisations) and deep, soul-singing over music that I swear could have been played by any of the funk bands I saw back in the '70s.

With a sound that would feel right at home in either the famed Apollo Theater or the hottest dance clubs of Havana, this young Afro-Cuban and crew take it to a whole different level. For example, the very traditional guajira piano riff on ""Cocinarte"" transitions to a James Brown-styled funk groove so easily, it sounds like they were made from the same root. (They are, but that is another story.)

The band breaks things down into the funkiest of bolero-swing only to have it explode into another funk romp, powered by lead singer Cimafunk's reimagining of 1960s soul singer Otis Redding and Cuban icon Benny Moré.

I've seen the band in Austin, Washington, D.C. and even on their home base in Havana, Cuba and every time, their tune ""Me Voy"" raises the roof and wakes the dead, with a deep Afro-Cuban, funk-party groove. This time, they turned the Tiny Desk into the hippest Cuban dance spot on the East Coast.

The band is making converts every time they play for new fans and you'll see why in this video. It catches them doing what they do best: combining two propulsive dance and musical traditions into one, singular musical vision.

GP3jS_gFs-g,The Pedrito Martinez Group: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Feb. 20, 2019 | Felix Contreras -- Something happens when you get a chance to see Afro-Cuban percussionist Pedrito Martinez perform. First of all, his smile radiates. It's hard to imagine someone happier than he is to make music in front of people; and as we saw during his turn behind Bob Boilen's desk, he mesmerizes with this almost otherworldly talent on congas. His hands can be a blur because they move so quickly. To the untrained eye, it's hard to see exactly what he is doing to draw out the sounds he does from his drums. I even know a little about playing hand drums and it still doesn't make it easier to fathom his remarkable talent.

Pedrito Martinez has gathered around him musicians who are helping him make the music he hears in his head. As you'll hear, it's full of twists and turns and unexpected stops that resolve into grooves so ferocious it's hard to resist moving your entire body in appreciation.

This particular performance at the Tiny Desk is highlighted by a stunning, unaccompanied conga solo that dazzled both neophytes and long-time fans of Afro-Cuban music.

Go ahead. Watch it repeatedly. It will still amaze each time you watch it.

gOwpqDhko3c,Chicano Batman: Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | April 17, 2017 - These guys had me at their name.

Ever since I heard the first EP back in 2009 I've watched Chicano Batman grow, with a sound that perfectly captures dark lounges, quinceñera dances, car shows and backyard parties.

Lots of other folks have heard something in this music — since that debut the band has played some of the biggest outdoor music festivals for diverse crowds around the country.

The magic of a band like this is in the details, and their performance here allows us to fall into the non-stop groove and passion of a sound that gets better and better with each performance. See for yourself.

García's music isn't dominated by his native Dominican Republic, but you can hear it in every note. His poetic lyrics are like short stories, sung by a voice both plaintive and evocative, yet always distinct.

From the opening strains of ""San Rafael"" to the final two tracks pulled from his latest album, A La Mar, VIcente García exhibits a fully formed and enchanting musical presence that will only get better over time.

PMpGjox3TBs,Rodrigo y Gabriela: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

April 28, 2020 | Felix Contreras -- This unprecedented period of worldwide lockdown has halted public musical performances. But it has also inspired intimate performances by musicians directly from the places where they create their music.

The Mexican duo known as Rodrigo y Gabriela travel the globe playing to crowds who are captivated by their almost telepathic acoustic guitar interplay. But they make their home in Mexico in a sunny Pacific beach town called Zihuatanejo (remember The Shawshank Redemption?). For this performance we get a peek at their home studio, where they surround themselves with guitars and dress down in sneakers and casual clothes. They run through tunes from throughout their recorded history, including a song they played at the Tiny Desk back in 2009. Rodrigo y Gabriela's picking and strumming feel more relaxed than usual but maintains their intense focus.

GeApLkyH8jg,Ibeyi: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Feb. 7, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- The twin sisters in Ibeyi started their turn behind the Tiny Desk by singing an invocation of a West African Yoruba deity.

They come by their connection to the Afro-Cuban culture by way of their late father, Miguel ""Anga"" Diaz, an in-demand Cuban percussionist who was part of a vanguard musicians who reinvigorated Cuban music before he died prematurely at age 45 in 2006. The sisters, Lisa-Kaindé and Naomi Díaz, carry that calling in their DNA, and how they've manifested it into their own art is nothing short of amazing.

As you see in this video, the twins (Ibeyi means 'twins"" in Yoruban) perform their music with the batá drums associated with Yoruban sacred music and their elaborate vocal arrangements channel the call-and-response of traditional African music. The melding of their voices when they harmonize can be breathtaking, but the same can be said about the messages behind their songs, themes that inspire both inward introspection and celebrations of life.

The sisters truly have a magic that transcends cultures and languages. I watched them lead a sold-out crowd at Washington D.C.'s 9:30 Club through a Yoruban chant, and it was mind-blowing. Imagine that magical intensity in the small confines of NPR Music's offices and you get an idea of how transfixed we were.

And now you can experience that yourself. Enjoy.

sRZi4QQEGBI,Gina Chavez: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"September 22, 2015 by FELIX CONTRERAS
Much has happened for Gina Chavez since I first saw her at an unofficial SXSW showcase about five years ago: two albums, fan and industry recognition, this year's Austin Music Award for Austin Musician Of The Year. Chavez's music has developed over the years, just as it should.

What hasn't changed is the intense openness and warmth of her performances. From that hot spring afternoon in Austin to this recent Tiny Desk Concert, it always feels as if she's performing just for me. And, of course, you get the sense that everyone else in the audience feels the same. See for yourself, and if you don't know her already, I dare you to walk away and not become a fan.

ppDcuEyNoIU,Rodrigo Amarante: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Rodrigo Amarante has made the year's tenderest record. Cavalo is sonically rich and spare at the same time: Every instrument breathes and every sound blends, yet every moment is distinct. At Cavalo's core are heartfelt songs and Amarante's sweet, smoky voice.

Amarante is from Rio de Janeiro, and these days lives in Los Angeles. You may know him from a few other projects: Rio's Los Hermanos, as well as Little Joy, which included Binki Shapiro and Strokes drummer Fabrizio Moretti.

For his Tiny Desk Concert, Amarante brought his small Harmony parlor guitar from the '30s, known lovingly as ""Butter."" These songs are stripped to their essence, and what you'll encounter here — and what you can't hear on Cavalo — is the warm, approachable singer's physical presence. Prepare to be drawn close to this intimate music. You'll want to crawl in bed with it. --BOB BOILEN

F7wIRxQEetc,Camila Cabello: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month with an ""El Tiny"" takeover of the (home) concert series, featuring J Balvin, Camila Cabello and several more musicians from all corners of Latinidad.

Anamaria Sayre | October 15, 2021
To the beat of her swishing hips and swaying percussionists, Camila Cabello's famous ""Half of my heart is in Havana"" reverberates across this musician-packed Miami set, with an at-home ease that feels novel for the global popstar.

Born to a Cuban mother and Mexican father in Havana, Cuba, Cabello is no stranger to blending borders and connecting worlds. As the final performance in our Hispanic Heritage Month Celebration, her El Tiny concert epitomises the cross-cultural, transnational musical identities we've centered over the course of the series. Each unique arrangement of her universal hits represents and explores a new facet of the identities and experiences that make up Cabello.

These stripped-down renditions of her hits ""Havana,"" ""Real Friends,"" ""Señorita"" and ""Don't Go Yet"" include more Latin instrumentation than the recordings — presumably bringing them closer to sounds that were first introduced to her as music during her childhood in Havana, Mexico City, and Miami.

The interlude featuring a sacred Afro-Cuban Santería chant and the following performance of the unreleased, Mariachi-based ""La Buena Vida,"" firmly root Cabello's El Tiny performance within two cultural traditions that don't typically glitter under the harsh lights of a global stage.

Here, we find Camila on the precipice of a voice that magically layers pop with tradition, holding all parts of a complex identity in seamless harmony. Flanked by Cuban congueros and Mexican mariachi, all aglow under the Miami sun, Camila Cabello's heart has never felt more whole.

2Ws_5-hiqao,Seu Jorge: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert From The Archives,"We've been filming Tiny Desk concerts for more than 10 years. While revisiting our archives, we discovered that some of our earliest concerts never made it to YouTube! 
Watch Seu Jorge’s Tiny Desk concert from 2010: https://www.npr.org/2010/09/13/129754791/seu-jorge-tiny-desk-concert


Jasmine Garsd | September 13, 2010

Like many in America, the first time I heard Seu Jorge was through his role as a melancholy singer in the movie The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou. His rendition of David Bowie classics mesmerized me. The ache of his thick, raw vocals is nearly unbearable. Perhaps it's something about a burly grown man whose voice seems about to give in to tears that's simply heartbreaking. Or perhaps it was the shock of hearing Bowie's music, which in its original incarnation was pure glam rock, sung by a boy from one of Rio de Janeiro's worst slums.

In his newest project, with the company of his fantastic band Almaz, Seu Jorge is far more versatile, almost as if the band were encouraging him to go to that bar, hit that dance floor, flirt with that supermodel. But no matter how smooth he is, he's still that melancholy guy who played Bowie on Steve Zissou's ship (not to mention his heartbreaking turn in the film City of God, as a victim of a sociopathic druglord). Jorge's covers of classic Brazilian songs like ""Saudosa Bahia' — which is about wanting to go back home — find him at his best.

I've always been curious to find out what Seu Jorge sounds like live, and in this Tiny Desk Concert I finally got my answer: He sounds as powerful as he does on his records, if not better. And he loves to play live, feeding off the energy of the audience. Later, he mentioned to me — while on his fourth cigarette break; there's a reason behind this man's raspy voice — how much he enjoyed being able to play while sitting right next to audience members. Here's hoping he comes back soon.",2021-11-12 15:42:15,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ws_5-hiqao,ELTINY,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2Ws_5-hiqao/default.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2Ws_5-hiqao/mqdefault.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2Ws_5-hiqao/hqdefault.jpg,NPR Music,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A
3oY-GQVzAX8,Bomba Estereo: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Sept. 22, 2017 | Felix Contreras -- If the Tiny Desk offers one lesson, it's that greatness doesn't diminish with less volume. The lesson doubly applies here.

During their performance, Bomba Estereo's Simon Mejia (bass and keyboards) observed that it was the quietist the band has ever played; they rose to the occasion with an intense performance that reflects their earliest days working smaller venues in Colombia.

Band leaders Mejia and Li Saumet (lead vocals) have been consistent in their devotion and homage to Afro-Colombian music throughout their five albums, and steadfast in their fantastic mash-up of electronic music, creating a sonic signature that has become popular around the globe.

But you won't hear that on this video.

What you'll hear is the power of their songwriting and arranging with this stripped-down presentation— which helps remind us of why we fell for this band in the first place.

O70s9aV_9_Q,Café Tacvba: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Oct. 12, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- It's appropriate that the pioneering Mexican band Café Tacvba (Tacuba) start its set with ""Olita del Altamar"" (""Waves from the High Seas"") from the group's 2012 album El Objeto Antes Llamado Disco. It's essentially an incantation of the magic that transpired during their performance behind Bob Boilen's desk. The lyrics sing of the comings and goings of waves, symbolic of the passage of time and fueled by the Mexican folk rhythm son jarocho, a favorite of the band's since their start almost 30 years ago.

They then fast forward to ""Diente de León"" (""Dandelion""), from their 2017 album Jei Beibi. It's a majestic, stripped-down version that puts the emphasis back on the lyric, a plea for existential and environmental harmony using the metaphor of the weedy flower. 

As usual, lead vocalist Rubén Albarrán is a captivating central presence, evoking a sense of down-home camaraderie with his ever friendly smile that has become the band's most outward image. Having seen the band play in front of dedicated fans in massive stadiums in Mexico City, it's striking to see his movements limited to a few careful spins and dance steps while still managing to embody the intense energy of their music.

Their song ""Las Flores,"" from their 1994 album Re, slips into the ska groove that attracted fans to rock en Español in general and to Los Tacvbas in particular, a beat that captures the adventurous musical energy that swept all of Latin America in the early 1990s.

Not all bands would end their set with a power ballad, though very few bands hold their audience's attention and dedication like Café Tacvba. But that's just how they close their set, the four principal members together for almost 30 years, casting a musical spell that still captivates after all this time.

RvVqaCs-K_8,Carlos Vives: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space. 

In celebration of National Hispanic Heritage Month, NPR Music presents four very special Tiny Desk Home Concerts recorded especially for this week.

Felix Contreras | October 14, 2020
Vocalist Carlos Vives kicks things off in high gear on this Tiny Desk (home) concert with his trademark sound: a celebration of the music from his beloved home country of Colombia, mixed with rock and other Latin music style.

Spirited champeta dance grooves from the country’s Pacific coast permeate his classic 1995 hit “Pa’ Mayte,” and if you look closely you’ll see two of his backup vocalists also playing traditional gaitas Colombianas (flutes). They are used to spectacular effect as a transition between the title cut of his new album Colombiana and “La Bicicleta” (originally recorded with his compatriot Shakira), a vallenato fueled by a bit of reggaeton.

Presenting Carlos Vives has special resonance this week as his latest album recently picked up six Latin Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year.

wKd0HNg1kFQ,Rodrigo y Gabriela: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"I can't think of a better way to describe the music of Rodrigo y Gabriela than with three words: ""heavy metal flamenco."" And yet the duo doesn't play heavy metal — its members perform instrumentals on nylon-string guitars — nor does it play Spanish dance music. But the term fits because the pair's fierce guitar riffs feel powerfully electric, and because Rodrigo y Gabriela's rhythmic style showcases a frenetic strum that conjures the energy of flamenco.

The duo have just released a new album titled, 11:11, which pays tribute to the pair's heroes — Jimi Hendrix, Carlos Santana, Astor Piazzolla and Pantera's Dimebag Darrell. They recently performed a few tracks for the NPR Music Tiny Desk series including ""Hanuman"" and ""Buster Voodoo.""",2021-11-12 15:37:52,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKd0HNg1kFQ,ELTINY,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wKd0HNg1kFQ/default.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wKd0HNg1kFQ/mqdefault.jpg,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wKd0HNg1kFQ/hqdefault.jpg,NPR Music,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A
RG6O-Qq79G0,Nicki Nicole: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"From Sept. 15 through Oct. 15, Tiny Desk is celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month with an ""El Tiny"" takeover of the (home) concert series, featuring J Balvin, Camila Cabello and several more musicians from all corners of Latinidad.

Reanna Cruz | October 13, 2021
Sitting next to rapper Nicki Nicole, on a stack of books, you'll see an old Sony camcorder – throughout this six-song performance we cut back to its footage every now and again, the rough texture breaking from the pristine, offering a nostalgic sense of intimacy. It's a production choice that completely works and, in a way, reflects Nicki Nicole at large, as an artist born in 2000 and with a connection to sounds and styles beyond her years.

At multiple points throughout the performance, Nicki points and beckons to the audience, inviting them into her world, her lyrics, her sound. Every track carries a certain brand of swagger whether it be the intensity of her second song ""Mala Vida"" or her effortless, confident freestyle. Even when she slows it down, on ""Parte de Mi,"" strings and piano create an arresting connection between us and her – and her final song, ""Baby,"" is a bombastic head-bopper, enhanced by her deeply groove-oriented band, which includes everything from an accordion to a mandolin.

Fittingly, Nicki Nicole has a tattoo on her neck which, in English, reads ""bulls***."" She has said before that the tattoo represents her need to break free of the labels applied by both her culture and industry as a young, Argentine female R&B artist. If her concert is any indication, Nicki Nicole is here to stay, while moving ever further away from any preconceived notions of her artistry – the ""bulls***.""

yng5CTT8Ogk,Jenny and the Mexicats: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"March 26, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- Jenny and the Mexicats is a discovery from South by Southwest a few years ago that I haven't been able to get out of my mind, and with good reason: The band's high energy shows are unforgettable, as is its sound. Mixing flamenco, originally from southern Spain, with Jenny Ball's jazz trumpet background and a little bit of cumbia has created their one-of-a-kind musical identity.

The grooves these musicians create can be frenetic (as in the first performance here, ""Frenético Ritmo"") or slow and luxurious (""The Song for the UV Mouse House""). In both cases, the group presents the perfect cushion for Ball's impassioned singing and engaging stage presence. There are no weak points in the instrumentation, and with Ball out front, the songs come to life as the short stories they are — like that of the young lady who appreciates a beer before taking on life's challenges in ""Verde Más Allá.""

Watching this performance, it's easy to see why Jenny and the Mexicats is picking up new fans as the group travels the world spreading its good cheer. The musicians bring their festival circuit-level performance down to almost a whisper here, but the intensity of their playing remains. After watching, perhaps you'll end up like me, with their names permanently entered in your mental Rolodex.

tCrLnfwX088,Liniker e os Caramelows: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Oct. 29, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- Watching this performance is to witness a spell being cast, note-by-note. Liniker e os Caramelows (Liniker and the Caramelows) are from Brazil but steeped in the tradition of soul from here in the U.S. They started their turn behind the desk with the ballad ""Calmô,"" a testament to the power of slow songs dripping with soulful emotion. It was a bold statement of just who they are as a band and what they stand for.

You have to go back to the co-mingling of jazz and Brazilian music in the late 1950s to appreciate the affinity our two countries have had for each other musically. Lead vocalist Liniker Barros has obviously done her share of listening to soul singers and she effortlessly slides from lower registers to an emotional falsetto, though the Tiny Desk space did restrict the kind of vigorous floor show of dancing and moving from all the band members that I've seen at the bigger live performances they've done.

Liniker and the band shook things up to high-gear, Brazilian funk on the second part of ""Tua,"" complete with a mid-song, church-revival breakdown, featuring tenor sax. ""Remonta"" displayed the band's flexibility as they moved from ballad to a reggae bridge, eventually exploding into a majestic African-based Candomblé rhythmic finish.

This performance catches Liniker e os Caramelows as they spiral upwards toward wider acclaim and recognition. Seeing them this close helps to understand just how they cast their musical magic on their audiences.

qn6rgisZm1M,Jorge Drexler: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"April 13, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- Jorge Drexler is a poet with a gift for song. The Uruguayan singer-songwriter, like the iconic Latin American lyricists of the past (Mercedes Sosa, Victor Jara and Silvio Rodriguez, to name just a few), has that rare ability to surround multi-layered prose with music that lends an even deeper resonance to the words.

Drexler has his share of fans here in the U.S., mostly Latin American expats and others whose grasp of the language allows them to appreciate the nuances of his storytelling. But, as if often the case with music performed in languages other than English, audiences here sometimes miss out on an emotional connection with artists they would otherwise celebrate if they only knew what they were singing.

So, we decided to do something about that with Jorge Drexler's appearance at the Tiny Desk. With the cooperation of the artist, we translated Drexler's thoughtful and playful ruminations on the human condition, and included them as subtitles.

Those clever lyrics wouldn't hit as hard if not for Drexler's backing band of magicians. The mix of guitarists and percussionists conjured a stunning cloud of sound that allowed Drexler to take flight, like the existential dreamer that he is.

-rl26QKPHtE,Mariachi Flor De Toloache: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"January 8, 2016 by FELIX CONTRERAS
Mariachi Flor de Toloache's 2014 self-titled debut album earned a Latin Grammy nomination in the Best Ranchera category — quite an accomplishment, given that the category celebrates an incredibly long tradition of Mexican music. But it was no fluke: The group's members come by their mariachi skills honestly and with endless practice, while still looking for ways to take chances.

Still, the best way to introduce yourself to Mariachi Flor de Toloache is to see it live — something many have done as the band tours with The Arcs, both as members and as an opening act. It's got top-notch musicianship, mariachi swagger for days, and a performance style that captures all the power and emotion you'd hope for.

hU3P6dlNaB4,Lila Downs: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Felix Contreras | January 13, 2017 — Lila Downs has spent her career exploring the furthest reaches of Mexican folk music. With a voice that borrows heavily from opera, Downs performs the kind of full-throated mariachi singing that would fit right in at Mexico City's Garibaldi Square — ground zero for mariachi.

She can also coax the most tender moments from romantic boleros. But Downs is at her best when she and her band gather all of those influences to create cross-cultural expression that breaks down musical barriers. Entertaining and inspiring, she's as much a storyteller as a singer, and her between-song banter lays bare the Mexican soul, only to have it punctuated in song.

YEnY43csEG0,Lido Pimienta: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

In celebration of National Hispanic Heritage Month, NPR Music presents four very special Tiny Desk (home) concerts recorded especially for this week.

Felix Contreras | October 13, 2020
Colombian vocalist Lido Pimienta has had one of the musical highlights of a year marked by tragedy and uncertainty. The healing magic of her album Miss Colombia transfers beautifully to this visually stunning Tiny Desk (home) concert. (Extra points if you can spot the tiny Tiny Desk!)

Backed up by a bevy of international musicians based in her new home of Toronto (I see you, members of the Cuban group Okan), you can hear for yourself how Pimiento's quartet of songs challenge the concept of just what qualifies as ""Latin music"" in a way that both honors and expands tradition.

There is added poignancy to the video; the visual theme is a quinceañera, a coming of age tradition that Pimienta could not share with her mother who had to flee Colombia. With her mom present at the video shoot, Pimienta uses her energetic performances to close a dramatic circle with her mom as we celebrate with her.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Anamaria Sayre | November 3, 2021
Every inch of Joss Favela’s Sinaloa-based, sombrero-shrouded “El Tiny” concert invokes the musical lineage of Mexican Regional music. Mixing soulful vocals with twangy guitars and a classic accordion, he opens with a sweet rendition of a genre staple, love ballad “Pienso en Tí.” Next, he dips into a heartfelt, piano-driven version of a song he wrote for his sister “La Mejor Versión de Mi.” Taking a beat between the tracks, he invites us to partake in the legacy of generations of caballeros that preceded him. “Yo soy de un rancho que se llama Caitime, Sinaloa, Mexico y con esta música crecimos,” he says, “esta música vivimos, y nos gusta porque son nuestras raíces, nuestra cultura, nuestra gente. (I’m from a ranch town called Caitime, Sinaloa, Mexico and we grew up with this music, we live this music and we like it because it’s our roots, our culture, our people.)”

After moving through an upbeat performance of “El Alumno,” Kinky bassist Cesar Pliego Villarreal joins the ranchero ensemble. The Monterrey native uses his bass to infuse a different Mexican tradition on three more classic Regional tracks: “Me Vas a Extranar,” “Bonita” and “Cuando Fuimos Nada.”

As torch-bearers of a complex and beloved sonic tradition, one can imagine there are moments for Mexican Regional stars where preservation precedes performance. At the end of his Tiny Desk, the caballero pauses and allows sweet accordion sounds carrying souls of the past to fill the space.

“Muchas gracias Tiny Desk,” Favela says, “por llevar nuestra música regional a tantos lugares,
y tantos corazones. (Thank you very much Tiny Desk for taking our regional music to so many places, and so many hearts.)”

n7w0-KgZMdY,Miguel: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Miguel turned up in the NPR Music offices early one morning, after playing a show late the night before. He appeared light and calm, and betrayed no hint that he was nervous about stripping his highly produced hits down to their bones. Accompanied by just his guitarist, Dru DeCaro, Miguel eschewed flash and went big on small gestures — ingratiating ad libs, only one full spin and voice control that kept the songs close to his chest but emotive enough to translate to the back of the room. He told us he wrote his Grammy-nominated song ""Adorn"" with no idea that it would take him to our tiny stage. But he was made for it. His style was compact and graceful, his manner self-aware and open.

After releasing two albums, the 27-year-old performed as if he'd spent years of his life pressing rewind and pause on the great entertainers of our time — James Brown, Prince, Sam Cooke, Jackie Wilson, Michael Jackson. After he ended his set, I wanted to ask who'd taught him the most, but the crush of admirers loomed and I got out of the way of the cellphone cameras. He's a genuine, modern-day star. --FRANNIE KELLEY

bWdZP2Qj6wA,Los Hacheros: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"June 30, 2016 by FELIX CONTRERAS • Sometimes it's necessary to get back to basics. In the case of Los Hacheros, that means returning to the deep groove of Afro-Caribbean music that provides the source material for modern salsa and all of its permutations.

As you'll see in this video, the band's dedication to authenticity is masterfully executed with a serious dose of sabor. In fact, the band was so swinging, it was impossible to sit on the sidelines and pass up my own chance to jump in during ""Bambulaye"" and perform with the band myself. So clear out the furniture and turn up the sound on this video to create your own dance party.

iK1uBBv83M0,Ozuna: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

In celebration of National Hispanic Heritage Month, NPR Music presents four very special Tiny Desk Home Concerts recorded especially for this week. This video from global superstar Ozuna is a world premiere.

Oct. 16, 2020 | Stefanie Fernández -- From a verdant room tucked away in Miami, Ozuna's Tiny Desk performance might allow you, as it did me, to forget for a moment that he's one of the most watched and listened-to artists on earth. For someone whose work often operates at galactic proportions, this performance of five songs makes room for Ozuna's sweet tenor to take center-desk in a love letter to the global communities that supported and streamed him to god tier status.

The Puerto Rican singer kicks it off with a breezy rendition of ""Caramelo"" that leads into a solo version of the sun-drenched ""Del Mar"" from ENOC, his fourth album that he's deemed a return to his roots. This pared-down performance makes good on that promise, reworking star-studded collaborations, like the ballad ""Despeinada,"" as they should be sung: languorously and with intimacy. Even the pop smash ""Taki Taki"" sounds brand new, buoyed by his alchemical flow and energy.

Ozuna is a crown jewel in the global crest of Latin pop, a movement whose modern success in reggaeton and Latin trap is indebted to the Caribbean genres Ozuna heard growing up in Puerto Rico, sounds like old-school reggaeton and reggae en español, dembow, dancehall and more. From then to now, Ozuna's bare talent remains his greatest asset. It's rare to see a star of his magnitude brush the earth so closely, and when it does, it's even rarer for it to feel and sound like second nature.

Monsieur Periné hails from Colombia, a country known for its Afro-Colombian cumbia, as well as New York-style salsa. Instead, however, the band has embraced 1920s-era, guitar-driven jazz from the U.S. The unlikely inspiration has resulted in a large and international following, as well as a Latin Grammy not too long ago: Monsieur Periné was named 2015's Best New Artist.

Words don't do this band justice. Play the video and discover Monsieur Periné's magic for yourself.

aWjihS2LHLs,Juanes & Mon Laferte: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"May 23, 2018 | Felix Contreras -- Colombian pop star Juanes and Chilean singer Mon Laferte recently wrapped up a sold-out tour of the United States, which (lucky for us) included a stop at the Tiny Desk.

Laferte began the concert solo with the torch song ""Pa' Dónde Se Fue"" (Where Did You Go?). She sang the break-up story with a smirk that belied the heartache hiding in her poignant lyrics. Then, after a short set break starring the Tiny Desk engineer Josh Rogosin, Juanes joined her to perform the duo's sultry single, ""Amárrame"" (Tie Me Up).

It's rare to see Juanes in such an intimate setting. After almost two decades of performing solo, the Latin pop star is more of a stadium and arena kind of guy. It's a treat to hear his voice unencumbered by loud speakers or crowd noise, and to see his facial expressions as he sings lyrics that many of us know by heart. This marked a return to the intimacy that fueled his earliest days and that's still present in the personal lyrics that have sold millions of records.

That intimacy was heightened by the presence of Laferte. The duo performed a PG-13 version of ""Amárrame,"" a passionate pop song with lyrics reminiscent of 50 Shades Of Grey. You can sense an obvious chemistry between the two during that song, as well as on the Juanes classic ""Fotografia"" (which originally featured Nelly Furtado).

Juanes closed out the concert solo with a stripped-down version of ""Es Tarde"" from his last album, Mis Planes Son Amarte. The performance demonstrates why Juanes and Laferte's duet tour sold out across the U.S. this year. There is a magic here that makes for repeated viewing. It's that much fun to watch.

SW6L_lTrIFg,C. Tangana: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert,"The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Anamaria Sayre | April 20, 2021
C. Tangana's extended family basking in the warmth of sobremesa with easy smiles and effortless baile looks otherworldly after more than 13 months amid a global pandemic. But considering the Spanish rapper's past year back home in Madrid, the simplicity feels fiercely authentic. (Check his mama and tía vibing in the corner.)

This first live performance of his latest album, El Madrileño (including a global premiere of a fresh single, ""Me Maten"") buzzes with communal energy, spotlighting talent from across Latin landscapes. From Mexican Regional to Spanish flamenco, C. Tangana is simultaneously coming home and reaching out to bridge Latin music boundaries. He's building a community of cross-cultural collaboration, rooted in a unifying love of language and tradition, making it clear he's intent on giving everyone a seat at the table.

The entirety of the show, from impromptu harmony to string octet, hums along with a distinctly Spanish cadence, paying homage to the flamenco-infused streets the global superstar came up in. The concert's star-studded cast of Spanish collaborators, including long-time friends (producers Alizzz and Victor Martínez) and new contributors (rumba legend Kiko Veneno and flamenco-pop icon La Húngara), are each spotlighted for their contributions to the record.

All these parts compound in a room full of people with a shared desire to connect and create juntos, manifesting an authentic joy we've seen again and again at the real Tiny Desk. And at the helm is C. Tangana, humming a melody and bringing the room to life: hands, harmonies, heartbeats, perfectly in sync.

SET LIST
C. Tangana and Antonio Carmona, ""Me Maten""
C. Tangana and Kiko Veneno, ""Los Tontos""

Oct. 27, 2017 | Felix Contreras -- Natalia Lafourcade is a successful singer-songwriter whose voice and music live on the edge of pop, but maintain a distinct independence.

A few years ago, while Lafourcade was traveling Brazil, she felt a great nostalgia for her native Mexico and its folk music. When she finally returned home, she immediately called some friends for the kind of party that is ubiquitous in Latin America: lots of social drinking, lots of food and lots of guitars and singing. Classic folk songs were on the playlist and a good time was had by all.

Someone recorded the informal jam session and Lafourcade's management team heard the tapes. ""This is your next record!"" they told her.

That record, Musas: Un Homenaje al Folclore Latinoamericano en Manos de los Macorinos, Vol. 1, was a commercial and critical hit, and received a Latin Grammy nomination for Album of the Year. It only made sense for Lafourcade to bring her Musas tour to the Tiny Desk. The performances are an ode to a magical time in Mexican popular music, one that is revived with every note this singer and her band perform.

One important historical note: The two older gentlemen on the video are Juan Carlos Allende and Miguel Peña, two revered musicians who played with the iconic ranchera singer Chavela Vargas.

Set List

""Soledad y el Mar""
""Mi Tierra Veracruzana""
""Tú Sí Sabes Quererme""

MUSICIANS

Natalia Lafourcade (vocals), Ernesto Anaya (traditional Mexican guitar), Uriel Herrera (drums), Jorge Molina (double bass), Juan Carlos Allende [Los Macorinos] (acoustic guitar), Bernardo Ruiz (electric guitar)

sKHswNFsRww,"The Philharmonik, 2024 Tiny Desk Contest Winner: Tiny Desk Concert","Elle Mannion | May 29, 2024
While each Tiny Desk concert is special in its own way, we only publish one annually from a Tiny Desk Contest winner. This year, that winner is The Philharmonik —  an up-and-coming multi-genre artist from Sacramento, Calif. — whose entry rose to the top of nearly 7,000 entries submitted by independent artists. 

In that entry, singer Christian Gates and his band proved they knew how to make a song shine behind a desk, performing in an office setting in business casual attire. They keep up the act at the Tiny Desk, with Gates cosplaying as the team’s boss; he showcases his expressive stage presence and expansive musical range all while sitting in a swiveling office chair.

The group kicks off its celebratory set with its winning song, “What’s It All Mean?” Then, Gates shifts to the upright piano to perform “Drugs,” a theatrical song he says “is for all of those who have thought about doing alternative things because the paycheck was not enough.” He returns to the keyboard for “Chasing…” before flexing his rap abilities on “Colors.” The Philharmonik closes with the catchy “Pay Me,” a song I’m sure plenty of disgruntled workers will want to sing to their bosses after watching this concert.

Although Gates’ life has changed overnight since winning the Contest, he stays humble throughout his set, continually crediting his team’s hard work. “This office is a group effort, and this is just another day at the office,” he says.

6PgYuit1BXw,"Little Moon, 2023 Tiny Desk Contest Winner: Tiny Desk Concert","Bob Boilen | May 30, 2023
When 2023's Tiny Desk Contest winner Little Moon arrived at NPR, outward expressions of joy overshadowed the inner bundle of nerves this Springville, Utah band felt. The group's winning song, ""wonder eye,"" unanimously wowed our contest judges Sharon Van Etten, Baby Rose, Sudan Archives and Albina Cabrera. Tiny Desk senior producer Bobby Carter and I, also judges, were in awe hearing singer Emma Hardyman's 4-octave voice warming up behind the Desk. She and her husband, Nathan Hardyman, told NPR's All Things Considered host Ari Shapiro that they began writing ""wonder eye"" while Nathan's mother was in hospice care, and that he wrote the lyrics soon after she passed. ""'wonder eye' incorporates the idea of multiple deaths,"" Emma shared. ""I think it took the physical death to help us realize that death is really happening all the time — be it past versions of ourselves, old held beliefs, old judgments even. And to that extent, we're always grieving as well, which was also eye-opening.""

Without monitors or vocal amplification, one of the toughest things for a band to do when playing at my Desk is to get the balance and sound levels right. Emma and Nathan, joined by bandmates Bly Wallentine on bass, Bridget Jackson on harp, Chris Shemwell on drums and Grace Johnson on keys, all pretty much nailed it. The band's set, which includes two unreleased songs (recorded for a new album), displays a range of emotion and creativity with a promising future. The group will be hitting the road as part of the Tiny Desk Contest tour, so if Little Moon is coming to your town, come and hear this band's unique sound.

sN58k8tSFXg,"Alisa Amador, 2022 Tiny Desk Contest Winner: Tiny Desk Concert","Bob Boilen | May 31, 2022
It surely was a day of joyful tears. And those joyful tears for Alisa Amador, the winner of the 2022 Tiny Desk Contest, came at a time when she had been considering putting her music career on hold. For the staff of NPR and the Tiny Desk crew, it was our first Tiny Desk concert with an audience in over 800 days, and Alisa’s captivating music surely intensified our spinning emotions.

Alisa Amador opened with her Contest-winning entry “Milonga accidental,” a song about embracing your contradictions. It’s a song that our judges — iLe, Big Krit, Michelle Zauner (of Japanese Breakfast), Raveena, Nate Chinen (of member station WBGO), Tiny Desk producer Bobby Carter and I — all found to be so filled with passion. I often fall for a song because of the lyrics, and this is the first Tiny Desk Contest winner whose winning song is in Spanish. Despite the fact that I don’t speak Spanish, I felt the conflict, the yearning and the song's questioning. 

Alisa grew up in Boston, Maine, Puerto Rico and Argentina, and was raised by Rosi and Brian Amador, her Latin-folk musician parents who play in the band Sol y Canto; they were also in attendance. She’s been singing since she was four, and has been entering the Tiny Desk Contest every year since 2018. In fact, the song “Together,” which closes this concert, was an astonishing entry from 2020. For COVID safety, we limited the audience to a small group of masked NPR employees, yet the sing-along for the closing track was still powerful. 

Alisa also set her winning song to a lovely string arrangement performed by a Washington D.C. quartet and rehearsed for the first time just hours before the performance. The arrangements were originally done by Jamie Oshima after a recording session a few years back, and then Alisa’s friend Noah Fishman transcribed the arrangement. For the next three songs, she’s joined by Jamie Oshima (guitar, keys), Noah Harrington (bass) and Jacob Thompson (drums, keys).
 
“When will I know how to decipher my purpose? / When will I feel at home in my voice?” As Alisa sings those words to her winning entry in Spanish at the Tiny Desk, I’m thinking: Perhaps that moment is now.

l-JEdcOGuzQ,"Neffy, 2021 Tiny Desk Contest Winner: Tiny Desk Concert","Bob Boilen | October 27, 2021
It felt good to be home, if only for one night: home, in this case, being my Tiny Desk at NPR. We were about to film Neffy, our 2021 Tiny Desk Contest winner, at my desk at NPR headquarters. My corner of the NPR Music department looked just as I had left it almost 600 days ago; it's eerie inside and nearly nightfall outside. There's no audience for this Sunday evening concert, just our five-person Tiny Desk crew.

We had filmed almost 1,000 Tiny Desk concerts before we abandoned the office in mid-March of 2020. What was then exciting yet routine now felt somewhat like a hallucination.

For Neffy, it too was a dream: — a dream come true. Her joy during the recording was contagious. Neffy is Mecca Russell, a young singer who grew up around Arlington, Va., just across the river from NPR. Her Contest-winning song ""Wait Up"" is about living in New York, most recently during the COVID-19 outbreak, but yearning for home. In fact, Neffy did return to her childhood home, where she recorded her winning song with just her heartfelt voice and her guitar.

""I wrote 'Wait Up' like many other songs I've written: sitting on the edge of my bed. But I didn't know it would be the song that would change my life,"" Neffy told us. ""I got to sing lyrics I wrote in the privacy of my room late at night to a vast and loving audience is beyond my wildest dreams. For that, I am incredibly grateful, and quite frankly, still in disbelief.""

We hear three more songs from Neffy during her Tiny Desk concert. It's a small window into an outstanding talent, and we're so proud to share this extraordinary moment.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Presenting the 2020 winner of NPR's Tiny Desk Contest, Supported by State Farm

Oct. 5, 2020 || Linda Diaz -- Winning the Tiny Desk Contest has been a surreal experience for me, not only because it's a big, big honor, but because it's all happening in the midst of a global pandemic. Even just shooting my Tiny Desk (home) concert has been a wild ride: getting the band together, getting the NPR team together, figuring out how to shoot safely with everyone in New York City. At one point, we finally had everything set and ready to go. Then, days before the shoot, I tested positive for COVID-19. I will spare you all the details (lots of tears, lots of phone calls), but I am so grateful for my band, the NPR Music team and the Javits Center for going above and beyond for me, the human as much as me, the musician.

Even though I couldn't be at the Desk, I'm feeling lucky to have been able to share some extra little parts of my personality with my (home) concert. Like, how dope is it to be able to say that I'm not only the 2020 Tiny Desk Contest winner, but that we were the first musicians ever to perform on the top of the Javits Center?! In more ways than one, this concert is a victory and a dream come true for me.

Through this whole process, it has felt weird to be celebrating, but what has been reiterated time and again is that it is more than OK to be Black and celebrate and mourn and organize and rest and any other number of things. Black joy is radical because it actively opposes defeat. It is necessary.

wzyR_MWEGBU,Quinn Christopherson: NPR Music Tiny Desk Contest Winner 2019,"Watch the 2019 Tiny Desk Contest Winner play at the Tiny Desk.

June 3, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- A moment after our 2019 Tiny Desk Contest winner, Quinn Christopherson, finished his first song at the NPR offices, he made a confession. He looked at me, while tuning his ""vintage white"" Fender Telecaster, and said, ""I don't know if you know this, but when you called me and you told me, 'You won!' I got off the phone and I thought, 'Dang, I should buy a guitar.' Legit, did not have one. But that's Anchorage; that's the music community there. Everyone just borrowed me their stuff long term.""

Quinn and his musical partner, guitarist and singer Nick Carpenter, arrived from the cool of Anchorage to the swelter of D.C. They both donned shorts at the desk; Quinn's were newly cut off to conform to the weather.

What was most striking about their performance was their unfettered confidence. Watching them play together and hearing their songs, with their interweaving guitar lines and vocal harmonies, feels like seeing two brothers performing old favorites. The concert was fun and, at moments, reverent.

After opening with his brand-new tune, ""You Told Me,"" Quinn sang ""Glenn,"" a moving song about his father and their beautiful two-peas-in-a pod relationship. There's a line in that song that goes to the heart of Quinn's songwriting talents: ""My dad, he plays guitar, says he knows more than he can do. He tells me that I do more than I know."" Quinn writes story-songs about what he knows best, his mom and sister, about their addictions and his love for them. But on his contest-winning song, the one that closes this Tiny Desk performance, he took a close look at himself. ""Erase Me"" is about his recent transition, what it now means to be a man and how he sees the way the world treats him differently after so many years of being ""used to pulling the short stick"" as a woman. It's a revealing look at the roles of men and women in our culture at a pivotal time from a songwriter who, I believe, will be a defining voice in the future of music.

42MiCMJ6DJU,Naia Izumi: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"May 14, 2018 | Bob Boilen -- I am so proud of our 2018 Tiny Desk Contest winner, Naia Izumi. The band he brought and the songs they played for this winning Tiny Desk Concert made us all even prouder.

Naia was chosen after we reviewed nearly 5,000 video entries. And the talent that came to us through all those submissions was astonishing. Naia Izumi won us over with his mind-boggling and unique style of guitar playing — a combination of tapping on the fingerboards and soul-filled whammy bar-note bending. And his multi-octave singing range blended so eloquently with his guitar stylings.

""Soft Spoken,"" the song he submitted, felt singular and unparalleled to our panel of judges which included past Tiny Desk contest winner Tarriona ""Tank"" Ball, Tiny Desk alum Sylvan Esso and Gaby Moreno, along with NPR family members Talia Schlanger (WXPN), Russ Borris (WFUV), Toki Wright (The Current) and the All Songs Considered team of Robin Hilton and myself. It's a song, as I hear it, that speaks to the power inherent in the gentle and quieter voices that are often drowned out by the outspoken and boisterous ones. Its title was originally ""Soft Spoken Woman"" and, as we later learned, Naia had identified as a woman for nearly seven years. More recently, as he said in an interview with Washingtonian Magazine, ""I'm not into that anymore because I just want to relax with biology and be comfortable with what I have.""

Naia is often a one-man band playing on the streets with a drum machine. But for his Tiny Desk Concert he brought bassist Adam Matijasevic and drummer Kynwyn Sterling. He'd met Kynwyn after submitting one of his songs to a math rock Facebook group. And that's the thing: Naia's music draws from so many spheres of sound. There's that punctual, rhythmic, mathematical pulse to what he does, but there's also a fluid, almost African Kalimba sound in there as well. They're two sounds I wouldn't often think of as coexisting.

We're about to go out on the road with Naia Izumi to 10 cities. We'll be joined by some of the other Contest entrants that captured our attention and they'll share the bill alongside Naia. And though there is only one Contest winner, we discovered so many other great talents that we hope to feature in the future.

Remember that the spirit of the Contest is intended to bring out the best in you, to gather with friends and to create. Thank you for being a part of something so filled with magic. It was an honor to watch what you created.

QKzobTCIRDw,Tank And The Bangas: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Bob Boilen | March 10, 2017 — Out of over 6,000 entries — more submissions than we've ever received — Tank And The Bangas won, unanimously, this year's Tiny Desk Contest. I fully expected their victory performance here at NPR headquarters in D.C. to be celebratory. I didn't know we'd all end up in tears.

This band combines R&B with hip-hop's poetry and rollercoaster storytelling, with a flair and alchemy that could only come from New Orleans. Their winning song, ""Quick,"" mixes liquor and revenge — a sort of modern day take on a great folk tale, but peppered with their own idiosyncratic flair and humor. What I couldn't see, until they took over my desk, was the depth of their lyricism and the versatility of their players. At one moment fun-filled funk, the next laid-back jazz, rhythm-driven blues — and it all flows seamlessly. And it's fun to watch: There's a magic kinship between Tarriona ""Tank"" Ball and Anjelika ""Jelly"" Joseph as they share singing roles, like two best friends finishing one another's sentences.

This is the third year that NPR Music has put out a call in hopes of finding a shining star. I'm still amazed how, after sifting through thousands of videos from abundantly talented musicians, we can find a common winner amongst a range of judges with such different musical backgrounds. But in the end, my All Songs Considered co-host Robin Hilton, Trey Anastasio (Phish), Miguel, Anthony Hamilton, Ben Hopkins (PWR BTTM), BANKS, and folks who listen to an awful lot of music — NPR member station hosts Rita Houston (WFUV), Talia Schlanger (WXPN), Stas THEE Boss (KEXP) — and myself were all equally charmed, delighted and captivated.

And so here it is, a chance to see an artist truly blossoming. It's just the beginning: A few years ago, for our first Contest, Fantastic Negrito won our hearts. This year he won a Grammy. Last year Gaelynn Lea, an unknown violinist, teacher and singer sent a video captured on a phone and won our affection and souls. A few weeks ago, her Tiny Desk Concert had been seen more than a million times. These days she's taken to the road, touring the world.

Tank And The Bangas will be hitting the road in April with NPR Music to find their new audience — I'll be along for the ride — visiting many of our member stations with help from those music-loving beer brewers at Lagunitas. I can't wait to see the reaction in these crowds' eyes, as they fill with wonder and tears like ours did, experiencing this band for the first time.

n6oSeODGmoQ,Gaelynn Lea: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"Gaelynn Lea, the winner of NPR's second annual Tiny Desk Contest, makes music like nobody else. Her sounds are steeped in the deep melodies of great Irish fiddle tunes, but her performance and singing style aren't traditional. More than 6,000 artists submitted videos in which they performed an original song behind a desk of their choosing with the hope of winning a chance to play a Tiny Desk concert at NPR. Gaelynn Lea was the overwhelming favorite of our six judges.

After voting for Lea, I wanted to learn more about her and her remarkable talent. Following about a minute of just focusing on the desk, her video pans to a small woman in a wheelchair as she plays a violin she holds like a cello. Lea has brittle bone disease, which made it necessary for her to reinvent the ordinary — and, in this case, a way to play the fiddle.

I also discovered, after selecting Gaelynn Lea, that she'd become friends with Alan Sparhawk of the band Low. Sparhawk first heard her perform at a farmers market in Duluth, Minn., where they both live. They've become friends who sometimes make music together, recording under the name The Murder Of Crows, so I also invited Sparhawk to join Gaelynn Lea for two of her four songs at this special Tiny Desk concert. There was hardly a dry eye.

ymYjwsFz8iM,Fantastic Negrito: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert,"It says a lot that, with almost 7,000 entries to choose from, we selected Fantastic Negrito as the winner of our Tiny Desk Concert Contest. For his winning submission, he performed ""Lost In A Crowd"" in a freight elevator in Oakland. It was his passion, his voice and his backing band that landed him an invitation to perform behind my desk. We're proud of our choice.

As we learned after choosing him as our winner, Fantastic Negrito — a.k.a. Xavier Dphrepaulezz, pronounced dee-FREP-ah-lez — has a remarkable backstory. One of 15 children, he grew up in a strict home, and later signed a contract with Interscope Records in the '90s. That deal fell apart, though, and soured him on music-making. Then, a near-fatal car crash put him in a coma, and eventually left him without the proper use of his hands; he struggled with physical therapy for years to get some movement from what he now calls ""The Claw.""

These days, bolstered by a new outlook on life and music, he's reawakened and reemerged under the name Fantastic Negrito. You'll see that newly rediscovered purpose in his eyes and hear it in his voice, as he performs this Tiny Desk Concert with his fantastic band. -- BOB BOILEN
